Visual Working Memory 587</div>

broadest Baddeley-Logie usage, this usage makes active operation on retained material an <br>
essential <i>component</i> of the memory itself.<br>
<br>
I follow the yet narrower usage articulated in the characterization of working memory <br>
at the beginning of this section. I believe that this usage has become the most prevalent. <br>
According to this usage, working memory is the short-term retention of perceptual and <br>
conceptual content that is easily accessible to consciousness and that allows inhibition and <br>
manipulation in support of psychological or actional tasks. This usage follows a standard <br>
conception of <i>memory</i> as a capacity to encode and retain—and sometimes retrieve— <br>
information.<br>
<br>
Working memory, thus conceived, is not essentially active. Rather, it is essentially open <br>
to active operations on it. Baddeley’s sketch pad metaphor is a good one. It is a pad with <br>
sketches. It allows active re-sketching. The pad and its contents are not the sketching on it. <br>
The active operations on working memory are operations by other psychological systems, <br>
principally the executive control system, however deeply and functionally connected <br>
working memory is to them. Counting the various manipulations of retained content—<br>
especially conscious, controlled manipulations—a function of memory is, I think, a mis-<br>
leading use of ‘memory’.<br>
<br>
Working memory is a retentional system within a more complex system that includes <br>
operations on working memory by the executive control system and other systems. <br>
Working memory is a specific type of consciously accessible, short-term memory.<br>
<br>
Although much early theorizing about the executive control system connected it to <br>
short-term visual and auditory memory, the system has come to be ascribed many op er-<br>
ations on other types of psychological systems. For example, the executive control system <br>
includes operations on reasoning and theorizing that are much longer-term than anything <br>
retained in working memory. The self-control involved in not jumping to conclusions in <br>
propositional inferences (say, in mathematics) is implemented by the executive control sys-<br>
tem. Inhibition of impulsiveness in action is also a function of the executive control system. <br>
Inhibitions of interferences in perception and perceptual memory comprise only one type <br>
of inhibition that the executive control system effects. Similarly, the executive control sys-<br>
tem’s shifting of mental sets works not only on short-term memory, but on any mental task, <br>
no matter how removed from perception. The executive control system is a source of all <br>
sorts of flexibility, at various representational levels. Its operation on perceptual memory is <br>
one function among many.867 Thinking of it as a component of workig memory, rather than <br>
as a closely related source of operations on working memory, risks confusion.<br>
<br>
Further, because the executive control system carries out operations both at the level of <br>
perception and at higher representational levels, it is a mistake to characterize <i>it</i> as either <br>
perceptual or supra-perceptual, without qualification. Its attention commands, for <br>
ex ample, can be entirely perceptual-level. (See Chapter 15.)<br>
<br>
Some scientists claimed that working memory is a single, domain-general, amodal <br>
retention system.868 This was always a minority view. There is now sufficient evidence to <br><br>
