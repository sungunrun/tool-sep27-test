Perception of Property-Instances 167</div>
<br><br>
<i>de re</i> relation to the main topic of interest dominates. Further <i>de re</i> relations to tropes are <br>
usually abstracted from in linguistic communication. However, the <i>de re</i> construal that I <br>
highlight for perception can, with some awkwardness, be expressed linguistically: ‘that <br>
body having that instance of <i>cubical</i> has that instance of <i>brown</i>’. In perception, <i>de re</i> struc-<br>
tures applied to tropes are ubiquitous.<br>
<br>
So the stock phrase that I have so far used to illustrate the representational form of <br>
perception (‘(that x1)(brown(x1)cubical(x1)body(x1))’) does not convey the full structure <br>
of the corresponding perceptual state. In the perceptual content, there are referential <br>
applications to instances of the properties <i>brown</i> and <i>cubical</i>. If the perceptual state is <br>
accurate, one perceives not only the body, but those instances. So far, these aspects of the <br>
perceptual content are not marked in the symbolic rendering. Referential applications <br>
apply to these instances.<br>
<br>
Referential applications that function to refer to attribute-instances may succeed or fail <br>
in perception, even as the perceptual attributives brown and cubical successfully <i>indicate</i> <br>
the property-types <i>brown</i> and <i>cubical</i>, respectively. One can perceive a shape, but misper-<br>
ceive it as cubical. Then one’s perceptual state has established a semantical relation to <br>
<i>cu bic al</i>—the relation of indication. The perceptual state also attributes the attribute-type. <br>
But one bears no <i>de re</i>, referential relation to an instance of <i>cubical</i>. The state fails its func-<br>
tion to be a perception of (to perceptually refer to) an instance of <i>cubical</i>. The state also <br>
incorrectly attributes the type <i>cubical</i> to the shape, though it correctly attributes <i>shape</i> to <br>
the misperceived shape.<br>
<br>
When a perceptual state indicates a property-type, like <i>cubical</i>, it employs an ability-<br>
general attributive that marks repeatable perceptual capacities. When the perceptual sys-<br>
tem exercises the competence marked by a perceptual attributive on a particular occasion, <br>
it is sufficient for successfully indicating an attribute-type that the perceptual competence <br>
has been fashioned through systematic interaction with instances of the attribute in the <br>
past—through evolution or learning. By contrast, to successfully perceive—for the per-<br>
ceptual system to pick out—an <i>instance</i> of one of those attribute-types, the perceptual <br>
system must be appropriately causally connected to an instance of that type through the <br>
particular occurrence of the perceptual state. The attributive can indicate and attribute <br>
the type while failing to pick out an instance of the type. In fact, one could fail to pick out <br>
any shape at all—having a referential illusion of a shape. In understanding perceptual <br>
representational content, feature-type attributives, should be taken to accompany refer-<br>
ential applications that function to pick out instances of the attribute-types that the <br>
attributives indicate.<br>
<br>
This distinction between the way in which perceptual attributives represent (indicate) <br>
types and the way in which their applications represent (refer to) instances of types affects a <br>
perceptual state’s veridicality conditions. A perceptual state could derive from compensat-<br>
ing illusions. One could see a body as brown. The state results from a non-standard causal <br>
chain that led to the attribution of the color-type <i>brown</i> to a perceived body. Suppose that <br>
the body is brown, but one does not see the brownness (perceive the trope), or any other <br>
color-instance. One is caused to have a perception of it as brown by a com bin ation of fac-<br>
tors that make the attribution of <i>brown</i> a fluke, rather than a result of applying a perceptual <br>
competence successfully. Then, the body is brown. But the perceptual state is not veridical. <br>
The referential application that applies the attributive brown, and that functions to refer to a <br>
perceived instance of <i>brown</i>, lacks a referent. A perceptual application refers only if it marks </div>
