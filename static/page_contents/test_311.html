regis tra tion in pre-perceptual areas (including visual receptors), the retinal image, and <br>
spatial aspects of the distal environment—are structurally related. The physical layout of <br>
the visual receptors renders information registration of the retinal image iconic. The regis-<br>
tration of the retinal image has mappings into registration states in the central brain. Both <br>
bear mapping relations to visual perceptual representation. These natural mappings of <br>
geometric or topological structures among levels of information registration and spatial <br>
perception are each mappable to spatial structures in the retinal image and the distal <br>
environment. The mappings are natural, not representational.<br>
<br>
Showing that picture-like or map-like structures correctly model visual states hinges on <br>
these structures’ providing insight into perceptual competencies. Causal relations among <br>
perceptual states and between such states and behavior have been naturally and fruitfully <br>
explained by taking these states to have geometrical or topological structures that map to <br>
geometrical or topological structures in the environment that are literally spatial. Such <br>
models are fruitful because they suggest new hypotheses that a list of the relevant causal <br>
relations would never suggest.<br>
<br>
For example, suppose that visual perception were represented simply by a set of abstract <br>
propositions, with the form of the meanings of ordinary sentences. Then one would expect <br>
that size, shape, location, orientation would normally be factored into separate propos-<br>
itions one for each relevant attribute. In iconic, fully formed perceptual representations, <br>
such attributes are represented together as a package, although some may be processed in <br>
different sequences. This feature is not a consequence of being iconic. It is a prominent <br>
feature of iconic <i>perceptual</i> representation. It is widely assumed from many sources of evi-<br>
dence that spatial features of a scene are represented together, not separately.326 Not only <br>
perception, but imagery, various types of short-term perceptual memory, and long-term <br>
perceptual memory represent in iconic representational structures. All these capacities <br>
derive their iconic structure from perception.<br>
<br>
Evidence for this fact derives from the way different aspects of a perceptual or <br>
perception-derived representation are responded to. Many experiments show the normal <br>
interdependence of representation of size, orientation, shape, location. For example, sub-<br>
jects are asked to say whether an arrow points to an imagined dot. The time required to <br>
answer is proportional to how far the arrow is from the dot.327 A view that imagery is <br>
stored as non-iconic representations does not naturally predict interlocking representa-<br>
tions of different attributes. It must add postulates that purport to express relevant back-<br>
ground principles to explain the results. The principles are not motivated by any fruitful <br><br>
