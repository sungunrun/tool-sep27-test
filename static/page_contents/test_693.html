propositional, kinds. Propositional kinds have not been shown to enter into relevant com-<br>
putational systems, though of course there are many attempts to incorporate them. More <br>
specifically, they have not been shown to enter into computational systems with <br>
perceptual-level states. This fact constitutes a kind of penetration-failure, as far as current <br>
science has found.<br>
<br>
Pylyshyn and Fodor opposed New Look psychology’s idea that theoretical concepts or <br>
beliefs figure in implicit arguments that yield perceptual states. New Look psychology did <br>
not present computational models. Such models did not proliferate in psychology until <br>
later. Pylyshyn and Fodor’s talk of logical connections and rationality as conditions on <br>
penetration were, I think, ill-considered attempts to situate New-Look-like positions in <br>
the very different context of computational explanation. I think that they would have done <br>
better to challenge neo-New-Look positions to produce computational explanations. In <br>
my view, their assimilation of New-Look ideas of argument and reasoning into their <br>
accounts of modularity—using such fudge terms as ‘quasi-reasoning’—has contributed <br>
very little to philosophical understanding. Their basic instincts were good. They were <br>
motivated by psychological patterns and architectures signaled by science.<br>
<br>
Supporters of cognitive penetration have focused on various types of purported causal <br>
effects on perceptual processing, or perceptual experience, or non-perceptual-but-<br>
perceptual-level states that then have causal effects on perceptual processing. These dis-<br>
cussions never argue that cognitive states occur in the computations that affect perceptual <br>
processing. All serious computational models of processing in the visual or visuo-motor <br>
systems to date make no appeal to states that are clearly and uncontroversially cognitive. <br>
Mainstream scientific explanations point toward a type of encapsulation of systems of per-<br>
ception and perceptual-level states from states that are uncontroversially cognitive. This is <br>
<i>computational</i> causal encapsulation.<br><br>

<b>The Cognitive Penetration Controversy<br><br>
</div>
</b>Disputes as complex and as dependent on as many conceptions of penetration, cognition, <br>
and perceptual system as are exhibited in cognitive-penetration disputes are never settled <br>
simply. I do not hope to settle these disputes, even relative to current science. I gather <br>
points already made and connect them with some broader points about perceptual psych-<br>
ology and psychological kinds.<br>
<br>
A lot of the literature on cognitive penetration, especially much of it that derives from <br>
social psychology, is methodologically weak and theoretically naive. I mostly ignore such <br>
work, though a little of what I criticize below includes it. It has been well criticized by <br>
others.1138<br>
<br>
From the outset of discussion of impenetrability, even sophisticated discussions  suffered <br>
from certain drawbacks—drawbacks nearly built into the discussion’s form. I review five.<br><br>
