332 The Iconic Nature of Perception</div>
<br><br>
Iconic representation occurs in language and thought, as well as maps, pictures, and <br>
perception. Language sometimes incorporates pictorial elements. Propositional thought <br>
often incorporates perceptual elements. Although pictures and perceptions are not <br>
propos itional, their iconic formats can be co-opted in propositional structures, making <br>
units in those structures iconic. Perceptual beliefs are iconic.359 Such beliefs incorporate <br>
into a propositional structure concepts that depend essentially for their mode of presenta-<br>
tion on perceptual attributives, hence on iconic representational contents. Such beliefs, <br>
like all representations and representational contents, contain non-iconic aspects: attribu-<br>
tive applications, for example. The popular view that being iconic is incompatible with <br>
being conceptual is mistaken. Conceptual and perceptual attributives differ in representa-<br>
tional function, and in capacities that they mark, not necessarily in format.360<br>
<br>
Some concepts incorporate iconic structures, just as some linguistic representations <br>
incorporate pictures. One could hold up a picture and use it attributively in language. One <br>
can even use an icon to express what a whole sentence expresses. Of course, no icon is in <br>
itself a sentence, or any other type of representation. (See this chapter, the section Noun-<br>
Phrase-Like Structure and Iconic Representation in Perception, <br>
(1΄)–(3΄).)<br>
<br>
Perceptual concepts utilize the mode of presentation, hence the format, of perceptions. <br>
It follows from the fact that concepts in perceptual beliefs <i>conceptualize</i> perceptual attribu-<br>
tives (see Chapter 6, the section Perceptual Contents, Propositions, and <br>
Noun Phrases) that some concepts are iconic. Concepts that contribute to propos-<br>
ition al structure can be as fine-grained as perceptual attributives from which they derive. <br>
Propositional reasoning can make use of the grain. One can form a belief and even reason <br>
about relations between finest-discriminable color shades while holding the color shades <br>
in perceptual view and making use of the mode of presentation of the perceptual repre-<br>
sentations of them (in conceptualizations) in one’s belief or reasoning. Under the right <br>
conditions, using attention, such conceptual representations of finest-discriminable <br>
shades can, I think, be held in at least short-term memory. But conceptualizing perceptual <br>
attributions of such shades, formation of perceptual beliefs with such conceptualizations, <br>
and even reasoning with such beliefs, does not depend on being able to remember them <br>
after one has lost sight of them.<br>
<br>
Recall that a concept is an ability-general representational content that constitutively <br>
functions as a sub-propositional unit in a propositional network, including a network of <br>
capacities for propositional inference. (See Chapter 2, the section The Three <br>
Fundamental Representational Constituents in Perceptual States.) <br>
Many concepts are non-iconic. Some iconic concepts abstract from referential applica-<br>
tions in perception or from much of the detail in perceptual representation.<br><br>

patible with the notion of conceptualization in perceptual belief that I set out in T. Burge, ‘Perceptual Entitlement’, <br>
<i>Philosophy and Phenomenological Research</i> 67 (2003), 503–548. The view is akin to equally mistaken views of <br>
concepts as essentially amodal. See Fodor, <i>The Language of Thought</i>, and E. Spelke, ‘Where Perceiving Ends and <br>
