understood as the result of a capacity to respond to various instances in representationally <br>
the same way. There are many routes to such sameness of representational response. Few <br>
run along the empiricist track.<br>
<br>
Another source of abstractness in visual systems is a capacity at the level of psy cho-<br>
logic al architecture. Attribution of generic <i>color</i> or <i>shape</i> in visual systems does not run <br>
through a procedure for abstraction from the concrete image-based, maximally specific <br>
perceptual representations. It consists in use of a built-in capacity to process representa-<br>
tions of color or shape. Here, abstraction derives from a generic type of capacity not from <br>
a psychological act or process. (See Chapter 4, the section Taxonomic Hierarchies <br>
in Perception.)<br>
<br>
Yet another source of abstractness is psychological interaction between perception and <br>
other perceptual-level capacities, such as perceptual memory and perceptual anticipation. <br>
Such interaction can be thought of as exercising a capacity to use the perceptual image-<br>
like representation in certain ways. Such uses affect representational contents born by an <br>
image-like representation. For example, a perceptual attributive for <i>body</i> differs from a <br>
perceptual attributive for <i>generic shape</i> in that the former is constitutively connected with <br>
a perceptual anticipation of continuity of such shape. Phenomenally, the shape and body <br>
attributives are indistinguishable. Body attributives are in a sense more abstract in depend-<br>
ing not only on what is currently visible, but also on what is anticipated to be visible. Both <br>
types of attributives would be associated with the same “part” of a perceptual image—as a <br>
body in a picture is not depicted separately from its shape. The difference in attributives lies <br>
in different capacities. Some capacities involve use and anticipation that go beyond the stimulus <br>
producing a given perception. (See Chapter 3, the section Body Categorization; <br>
Chapter 12, the section Primitive Attribution of Causation; Chapter 12, the <br>
section Primitive Attribution of Agency; Chapter 18, the section Perceptual <br>
Anticipation.)<br>
<br>
A similar point applies to the relation between a perceptual attributive for the 2-D <br>
shape of the visible facing surface of a 3-D volume shape and a perceptual attributive for <br>
the 3-D volume shape. A 3-D-volume-shape attributive is, in a sense, more abstract than a <br>
surface-shape attributive. Perceptions containing it are committed to surface-shapes that <br>
are not currently visible. The image of the two shapes is the same in any given perceptual <br>
state. The latter type of attributive is associated with different perceptual constancies and <br>
different perceptual anticipations from the former. The difference in abstraction is not a <br>
matter of neglecting concrete phenomenal aspects of an image in favor of more abstract <br>
aspects. It is a matter of different capacities and uses associated with current perception—<br>
anticipatory capacities, perceptual constancies, uses in action and reaction.<br>
<br>
A further type of abstraction is marked by schematic representation in perceptual <br>
memory. Such representation abstracts from referential applications to past-perceived <br>
particulars and retains only perceptual attributives from an earlier perception. This is the <br>
abstraction of loss. Schematic representation in perceptual memory again does not result <br>
from some mental operation of abstraction, such as existential generalization. Here, <br>
abstraction is just loss of concrete, causal, representational relations back to particulars <br>
that were originally perceived, but can no longer by remembered.<br>
<br>
A similar point applies to loss in perceptual memory of more concrete, more specific <br>
attributives that originally occurred in perception. Commonly, only more generic attribu-<br>
tives survive in long-term perceptual memory. Memory of generic aspects of a </div>
