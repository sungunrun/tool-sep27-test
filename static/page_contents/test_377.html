Framework 377</div>
<br><br>
A final framing point is that much of what we experience as immediate perception <br>
involves unconscious feedback from all levels of the visual hierarchy. Some of the feedback <br>
can affect brain areas that are involved in the very earliest processing. So feed-forward <br>
formations are supplemented by feedback loops.397 Feedback loops occur at many levels <br>
and come from many sources, from within perception-formation itself to long-term per-<br>
ceptual memory. Intra-visual-system feedback loops in anatomically early visual areas, <br>
V1-MT-V2-V3-V4, start 30–60 ms after initial stimulus and are prominent to 150 ms. <br>
Such early, intra-visual feedback loops affect perception of shape and motion location.398 <br>
As we shall see, some formation of perceptual representation of scenes and objects—<br>
including generic bodies, faces, and animal-bodies—occurs well within 100 ms after <br>
stimu lus onset. Some types of visual search require systematic interaction between infu-<br>
sions of attention, shifts in attention, various types of memory, and current perception. <br>
Feedback loops occur in all types of perception. Sources of feedback vary. One must dis-<br>
tinguish the temporally extended types of perception involved in visual search, from inter-<br>
mediate visual processing, and from fastest-formed perception. Here and in Chapter 11, <br>
I focus on perception that is formed first.<br>
<br>
Thus ends my sequence of framing points.<br>
<br>
Here is a simplified view of first-formed visual perception that I think basically right. <br>
This view is one of the main positive theses of Part III, particularly this chapter and <br>
Chapter 11. Visual perception yields objective representation of a fairly wide range of <br>
environmental attributes without depending on attention, memory, or conception, either <br>
before or after stimulus onset. First-formed perception produces perceptual representa-<br>
tions of physical attributes that are basic both for survival and for knowledge. The at tri-<br>
butes include spatial and temporal relations, shape and size properties, and super ordin ate <br>
kinds like <i>body</i>, <i>face</i>, and <i>animal-body</i>.<br>
<br>
Unquestionably, attention figures in foveating parts of a scene and thus in giving some <br>
perceptual representation higher resolution. Attention and memory also affect perceptual <br>
settings before stimulus onset. Attention enhances efficiency of visual processes in other <br>
ways. It facilitates accessibility of perceptual representation to consciousness and to mem-<br>
ory. Attention, either before or after stimulus onset, does not appear to be necessary for <br>
first-formed perceptual representation of specific attributes, though it may always be pre-<br>
sent in first-formed perceptual representation. In first formation of some perceptual <br>
attributives for surfaces, surface shape, 3-D volume shape, and body—and in referential <br>
applications to their instances—, empirical evidence indicates that even grabbed, ex ogen-<br>
ous ly generated attention does not have an indispensable role.<br>
<br>
Perception is initially the product of largely, but not fully, feed-forward processing. <br>
Processing registrations of external stimuli proceeds according to general, deterministic <br>
principles. The principles are either innate or acquired prior to the registration of the <br>
external stimulus. The initial processing of representation of bodies, many of their fea-<br>
tures, spatial positions, and scene-gist is carried through to completion within 100–120 ms <br><br>
