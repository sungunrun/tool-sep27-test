510 Perceptual-Level Conation and Action</div>

fairly obvious, but also empirically well supported, that conative representation of pro-<br>
spective motor acts guided by perception uses the same iconic mapping format that pro-<br>
prioceptive and visual representation do.682 Since conative states function to cause acts on <br>
particulars that must be specified in ways that make the acts possible, conative states share <br>
with perception a form and format that maps particulars in ways that characterize them <br>
by psychological capacities—attributives.<br>
<br>
Another oversimplification is omitting representational detail. A conative representa-<br>
tion would represent the motor movement that gets the hand into the relevant spatial rela-<br>
tion to grip the target body. The target body’s size, shape, orientation, and position are <br>
represented by the conative state, as they are represented by perceptual states. The grip-<br>
size is represented proprioceptively so as to coordinate with the perceptual and conative <br>
representations of the target body’s spatial properties and relations to the agent. The for-<br>
mula’s idealization suffices for present purposes.<br>
<br>
The condition for successful <i>de re</i> reference by the referential application (that x1) is that <br>
the action be caused by the conative state via the competence. This condition parallels the <br>
condition on reference by perceptual referential applications. To refer, they must be caused <br>
by a <i>perceived</i> particular<i>.</i>683 The accuracy condition for the targeting state requires that all <br>
referential applications succeed in referring, and all attributions are accurate of relevant <br>
referred-to particulars.<br>
<br>
Most relatively primitive conative states involve efference copy. Representational effer-<br>
ence copy is a short-term memory that retains a motor command. As the motor command <br>
is issued, memory retains a copy. The memory can cause anticipatory representation of the <br>
action outcome as tracked in perception. Efference copy is part of a monitoring-correcting <br>
loop that improves performance, in individual cases and in adaptation, over time.<br>
<br>
I remarked earlier that each of the generic types of states involved in relatively primitive <br>
action can be unconscious. Target representation can occur unconsciously. If one lies in <br>
bed and then suddenly jumps out, one need not have consciously set a goal. One’s jumping <br>
out of bed is certainly something one did. It can be guided by perception or perceptual <br>
memory. A target is representationally set. Conscious realization of one’s objective can be <br>
amusingly retrospective.<br>
<br>
Similarly, detailed anticipatory representations of one’s immediate movements and of <br>
the movements of a target-object are usually unconscious. Short-term memory that con-<br>
tributes to action guidance is often unconscious. Even perceptions that initiate and frame <br>
relatively primitive action can be unconscious. Much representation that precedes motor <br>
action is not accessible to consciousness, and may be phenomenally unconscious as well. <br><br>

<b>FN</b>683 One should not accept John Searle’s view that there is self-reference in the representational content of a <br>
perception or actional state (whether this be a propositional-level intention or a lower-level targeting state)—to <br>
the effect: the cause of this very state. For Searle’s view, see <i>Intentionality</i>, 48. For criticism, see T. Burge, ‘Vision <br>
and Intentional Content’, in E. Lepore and R. Van Gulick eds., <i>John Searle and His Critics</i> (Oxford: Basil Blackwell, <br>

Incidentally, the representational form that I set out here applies much more widely than in the psychology of <br>
action. Musical scores are schematic representations of action, I think. They are in schematic singular form and <br>
are representationally successful when they cause a performer to fill in the schemas with singular applications <br>
that constitute actual playing the notes specified in the score.</div>
