Primitive Attribution of Mechanical Causation 463</div>
<br><br>
As discussed in this chapter, the section Methodology for Finding <br>
Perceptual Attributives, I think that adaptation in a state is not in itself evidence <br>
for counting the state perceptual. Rolfs, Dembacher, and Cavanagh agree. They point out <br>
that even retinal specificity, in itself, is compatible with the adaptation’s occurring at a <br>
supra-perceptual, “cognitive” level. The retinotopic sensitivity of causal representation ren-<br>
ders it plausible that primitive causal representation of mechanical causation is iconic. <br>
However, as noted in Chapter 9, the section Iconic Perception, Iconic Concepts, <br>
Iconic Representation in Propositional Thought, concepts as well as per-<br>
ceptual attributives can be iconic.<br>
<br>
Moreover, conceptual applications that go through lower-level perceptual application <br>
bases adapt when the perceptual application base adapts. One could not perceptually rep-<br>
resent mechanical causation except by perceptually representing spatio-temporal proper-<br>
ties of moving entities. Adaptation of causal attribution piggybacks on the only way one <br>
can visually discern the relevant cases of mechanical causation—perception as of spatio-<br>
temporal-motion patterns. Here the application base involves a retinally specific angle on <br>
relevant movements. Adaptation in the application base percolates up to conceptual-level <br>
representation of causation whose application depends on that base. So even retinally spe-<br>
cific adaptation is not in itself evidence for a state’s being at the sensory-registrational or <br>
perceptual levels.<br>
<br>
Relevant adaptation is grounded in areas of the brain that encode retina-specific visual <br>
information. Areas known to have these features are V5 and the superior temporal sulcus. <br>
Both areas are known to be involved in representation of collisions.604 More detailed study <br>
of adaptation and neural localization may provide more fine-grained understanding. But <br><br>
