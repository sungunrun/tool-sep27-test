subsequently given forced-choice tests. Subjects are presented with two pictures. They are <br>
asked whether one of them was in the sequence. At the faster speeds they think themselves <br>
to be guessing. The last picture in the sequence is not asked about—because processing <br>
the last picture is not interfered with, or <i>backwardly masked</i>, by a later picture. Variations <br>
on the method include presenting, before the sequence, a word or phrase, or a picture, that <br>
either anticipates a picture in the sequence, or is a decoy that does not occur in the <br>
sequence. Exposure times are varied.<br>
<br>
It was known that if pictures are presented for as long as a second followed by a blank, <br>
as opposed to being followed by a backward mask (a significantly different picture that <br>
could interfere with processing a previous picture), a huge number of pictures can be <br>
freely recalled for days.918 It was subsequently learned that absence of backward masking <br>
figured prominently in determining capacity for free recall. Single, backwardly masked <br>
pictures presented for very short durations (50 ms) can also be freely recalled, fairly eas-<br>
ily.919 Difficulty in free recall occurs with a combination of short exposure and a rapid <br>
sequence of different pictures, all of which have to be attended. If the pictures are rapidly <br>
presented in sequences, the masking severely limits recognition. Backwardly masked pic-<br>
tures in such sequences cannot be freely remembered if they are presented for 250 ms, but <br>
can be remembered for days at 90% accuracy if they are presented for 2 seconds.<br>
<br>
Backward masking dominates duration of exposure in limiting even recognition on <br>
forced-choice tests. With a blank, as distinguished from a subsequent picture that operates <br>
as a mask, recognition is almost as good for exposures of 110 ms as it is for exposures of 6 <br>
seconds.920<br>

Potter found that even when pictures are presented very rapidly in sequence, thus bur-<br>
dening every picture but the last with a backward “meaningful” mask, subjects showed <br>
some short-term retention. This result emerged not from free recall, but from forced-<br>
choice tests. Subjects were given two pictures after a rapid serial presentation and asked to <br>
say whether one of the pictures was in the sequence. Memory improved if the rapid <br>
sequence was preceded by one of the pictures.<br>
<br>
This result was no surprise. What was more surprising was that memory also improved <br>
if subjects were given a verbal descriptor of a target before the rapid sequence of pictures. <br>
Improvement was greater with antecedent pictorial search targets. But the difference was <br>
not dramatic. Verbally presented targets could be negative categories. If a target is pre-<br>
sented via ‘the only picture not of an animal’, subjects can better identify the picture in <br>
short exposures.921<br>
<br>
Enough detail is retained to distinguish somewhat similar pictures. For example, if the <br>
target is presented by the word ‘bird’, the subject can distinguish between there having <br><br>
