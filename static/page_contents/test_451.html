Primitive Attribution of Mechanical Causation 451</div>
<br><br>
Anti-individualism explains and helps justify the attribution of causal representation by <br>
scientists to children. Recall from Chapter 5, the section Support for (AA1), that <i>anti-<br>
individualism</i> for perception is the view that part what is necessary for a perceptual state to <br>
have a content that it has (here, the perceptual content cause) is for instances of that state-<br>
type and for non-perceptual sensory states that led to the formation of that state-type to <br>
enter into patterns of causal relations with the <i>representatum</i> of the content (here, the <i>repre-<br>
sentatum</i>, <i>causation</i>). The best explanation of the patterns that made the representations to <br>
be what they are appeals to causal interactions between patterns of mech an ic al causation in <br>
the environment, on one hand, and individuals or psychological systems with the relevant <br>
representational capacities, on the other. The interaction is not only causal influence from <br>
the environment to psychological systems. It is also causal influence from individuals to the <br>
environment through action and reaction. Interaction with environmental-attribute-<br>
instances and with causal patterns in the environment—prom in ent ly, in the evolution of <br>
the capacities—helps give the representations the contents that they have.581<br>
<br>
Roughly, causal launchings occur when and only when one suitably sized object moves <br>
suitably to be contiguous with another and then, without delay, the second object moves <br>
away from the first. Causal interaction is over and above these movement patterns. The <br>
Humean tradition asks why one should believe, apart from an individual’s explaining a <br>
difference between the movements and causal interaction, that an individual represents <br>
causal interaction in addition to the pattern of movement. The answer starts from anti-<br>
individualism. The best explanation for why individuals find this particular pattern of <br>
movement salient is that they are tracking causation.<br><br>
