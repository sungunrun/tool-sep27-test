98 perceptual constancy</div>
<br><br>
Neural analogs of this rough sequence occur in the ventral processing sequence, start-<br>
ing with the first cortical area specialized for vision, V1, proceeding through V2 and V4, <br>
and culminating with categorization on the basis of shape in the inferior temporal cortex <br>
(IT). Although this ventral sequence is by no means the only neural underpinning of spa-<br>
tial perceptual constancies, it is the most studied one.<br>
<br>
The first spatial perceptual constancies may be supported in first-pass V4—that is, just <br>
after signals from retinal sensors first get to V4, before recurrent processing or “top-down” <br>
feedback. V4 seems to support rudimentary constancies for 3-D volume shape and size. <br>
The most rudimentary 3-D spatial constancies are formed, supported by V4, by 58 milli-<br>
seconds (58 ms) from stimulus onset.103 Perceptual representation of motion in depth may <br>
already be supported in MT, an area that gets some retinal signals even faster than V1 does.<br>
<br>
The most generic categorization of bodies, by their having a 3-D volume shape with <br>
closed outer boundary, may also be formed by that time, supported in V4.<br>
<br>
By the time proximal stimuli generate relevant neural responses in IT—in roughly <br>
70–80 ms from stimulus onset—some of the basic spatial perceptual constancies and the <br>
most elementary categorization that is based on attributions of <i>specific</i> spatial shape-<br>
properties are in operation. For example, by then, categorization of an object that is <br>
grouped with animal-bodies occurs. Categorizations of faces occur by then.104 These are <br>
first-pass, sketch-like perceptual categorizations. These categorizations, like the spatial <br>
attributions on which they are based, are <i>perceptual</i>—associated with perceptual constan-<br>
cies. (See Chapter 11, the section Categorization and TiMing.)<br>
<br>
As noted in Chapter 1, there is a wave of feedback after this first pass of perception-<br>
formation, beginning roughly 125–140 ms after stimulus onset. The feedback is from <br>
higher to lower visual areas and from perceptual memories. This wave has the effect of <br>
filling in the roughest spatial and object representations that had already been produced.<br><br>

<b>FOOTNOTES</b><br>
<b>Cont FN</b>103 As mentioned earlier, these timing points vary with specific perceptual constancies. The cited timings are <br>
dominant among sources that I have read. They are not uniform. For example, Isik, Meyers, Leibo, and Poggio, <br>
‘The Dynamics of Invariant Object Recognition in the Human Visual System’, take size constancy not to emerge <br>
fully until 125 ms and position constancy somewhat later. These findings may depend on focusing on the con-<br>
stancies in their fully robust forms. There seems enough tolerance to differences in proximal stimulation at earl-<br>
ier timings to lead many researchers to take the earliest, most rudimentary spatial constancies to occur much <br>
earlier. See also N. Murty and S. Arun, ‘A Balanced Comparison of Object Invariances in Monkey IT Neurons’, <br>
