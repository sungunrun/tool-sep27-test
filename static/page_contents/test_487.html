qualification or justification. These generic capacities are often cited so as to suggest that <br>
they stand on a canonical list of cognitive capacities. Rarely is the list motivated. <br>
Motivations are cursory and thin.<br>
<br>
Both sides have also failed to think hard about what counts as “penetration”. This failure <br>
is partly the fault of initial proponents of impenetrability, Fodor and Pylyshyn. They too <br>
failed to produce, or stand consistently by, a clear formulation. Subsequent discussion has <br>
done little to clarify what drove, or what might be of interest about, the original claims.<br>
<br>
Having broached these issues, I table them. I return to them in Chapter 19. My main <br>
aim in Chapters 13–18 is to lay groundwork for better understanding of perceptual <i>sys-<br>
tems</i> and perceptual-motor <i>systems</i>, on one hand, and the border between the perceptual-<br>
level and higher levels of representation, on the other. There are, of course, many <br>
psychological kinds. Some overlap. Their instances interact, in many ways. Philosophical <br>
understanding of lower representational mind can benefit from gaining better concep-<br>
tions of perception and its perceptual-level capacities.<br>
<br>
In the chapters that follow, I emphasize kinships between visual perception and sub-<br>
species of attention, conation, affect, memory, learning, anticipation, and imagining. I dis-<br>
cuss why these sub-species are not “higher-level” than perception, as cognition is <br>
commonly taken to be.<br>
<br>
Before discussing auxiliary perceptual-level capacities, I revisit perceptual cat egor iza-<br>
tion. In the next section, I caution against what used to be a common idea, still voiced <br>
sometimes even now. The mistaken idea is that categorization is essentially conceptual, <br>
in a sense of ‘conceptual’ that entails supra-perceptual. Some versions of this idea hinge <br>
on confused notions of perception or cognition. Some versions rest on clear, but mistaken <br>
views of the reach of purely perceptual processing—processing that does not depend on <br>
any non-perceptual capacity. As Chapter 11 showed, it is now empirically well established <br>
that purely perceptual competencies and processes initially produce attributives that cat-<br>
egor ize—attributives like body, animal-body, face. Perceptual categorization is a percep-<br>
tual capacity in the narrowest sense of ‘perceptual’. It emerges initially as the last stage of <br>
dominantly feedforward processing.<br>
<br>
Before discussing perceptual-<i>level</i> capacities that have been mis-characterized as cogni-<br>
tive, I discuss, in the remainder of this chapter, a <i>perceptual</i>  capacity that has been mis-<br>
characterized as cognitive.<br><br>

</b>Terminology for different types of categorization varies in the scientific literature.647 As <br>
indicated in Chapter 11, the section Categorization and Timing, I take cat egor iza-<br>
tion in perception to be intra-attribute attribution of kinds, as distinguished from proper-<br>
ties (features) or relations. Kinds are marked by perception’s treating them as attractors of <br>
other properties.<br><br>
