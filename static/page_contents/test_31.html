Representations and Representational Contents 31</div>
<br><br>
representations of the same type, instances of the same representational content.26 The <br>
representations in your psychology are different from those in my psychology. Similarly, if <br>
I think poachers are deplorable yesterday, and I think poachers are deplorable tomorrow, <br>
I employ different representations.<br>
<br>
Again, all four cited occurrences of thought, all four thinks, all four representations, <br>
have something in common. They are all thoughts with a single <i>representational content</i>. <br>
Representational content can be shared by different individuals. It can be present in the <br>
same individual at different times. Representational content bears a very loose analogy to <br>
linguistic meaning. Somewhat as we do not identify a meaning with instantiations of the <br>
meaning, we do not identify a representational content with the occurrent representations <br>
that instantiate it.<br>
<br>
Complex representations, like the one just cited, have component parts that are them-<br>
selves representations. In my thought at noon today, poachers are deplorable, I use a rep-<br>
resentation poachers. This representation is an instance of the representational <br>
content-type, poachers. I also use a representation are deplorable, an instance of the repre-<br>
sentational content-type, the concept, are deplorable. The complex representational con-<br>
tent, poachers are deplorable, contains components poachers and are deplorable. An <br>
instance of the representational content has instances of its representational constituents. <br>
The representations are particulars. They are not repeatable in different times, places, or <br>
minds. The representational contents so far illustrated <i>are</i> repeatable. The same content is <br>
instantiated in your mind with the yesterday-representation poachers (and representation-<br>
instances of are deplorable and poachers are deplorable) and in my mind with the today-<br>
representation poachers (and so on).<br>
<br>
Representations are always instances of repeatable types. They are <i>particulars</i>. That is, <br>
they are non-repeatable, in that they are localized in time and in a mind. Representational <br>
contents are always either partly or wholly composed of repeatable types. Types are <br>
abstract. They can be repeatedly re-instantiated in different specific places, times, or <br>
minds. The repeatable types themselves are not in any specific place, time, or mind.<br>
<br>
Psychological laws are patterns among repeatable types. So explanations in psychology <br>
that attempt to discover and articulate laws are more centered on repeatable representa-<br>
tional contents—that is, psychological kinds—than on any particular representations. <br>
A law for the formation of a perception as of a certain shape’s being at a certain distance is <br>
not about any particular perceiver’s perceptions, much less a perceiver’s perceptions at a <br>
given time.27 The science is primarily concerned with types of perceptual states (repeatable <br><br>

<b>FOOTNOTES</b><br>
<b>Cont FN</b>26 I take the thought not to be present tensed, but to be true at all times. I use any <i>underlining</i> <i>of a piece of <br>
language</i> as a name that refers to the language’s representational content (or an approximation to that content), or <br>
to a representation (that is, an instance of the language’s representational content). It is not assumed that the <br>
content referred to is a linguistic meaning. It could be the representational content of a perception. Context <br>
shows whether I intend a representational content or a representation. <i>Italics</i> are used to refer to attributes: kinds, <br>
properties, and relations. Thus: the kind <i>tiger</i>; the property <i>cubical</i>; the relation <i>larger than</i>; a concept tiger <br>
(which represents, indicates, the kind <i>tiger</i>); a perceptual attributive cubical; the thought content tigers are <br>
 dangerous. Italics are also used for foreign words, for emphasis, and for introducing technical terminology. <br>
Context should make the usage clear.<br>
<br>
27 All representation involves representation <i>as</i>, or at least <i>as­ of</i>. It involves characterization. I use the term <br>
‘representation <i>as of</i> ’ to explicitly allow for failures of characterization that hinge on failure to representationally <br>
connect to (indicate) a real attribute. Thus someone could represent (characterize) a shape as of a round-square, <br>
despite there being no property <i>round square</i>. As used in English, ‘representation as’ suggests that there is a <br>
property that is attributed. All representation-as is representation-as-of.</div>
