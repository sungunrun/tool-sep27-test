212 Attributives, Referential Applications in Constancies</div>

types of perceptions formed are different from one another. The ways of perceiving the <br>
instance <i>i</i> of the color shade—the perceptual attributives applied—are different. They dif-<br>
fer even though they indicate and attribute the same color shade <i>C</i> as color shade <i>C</i>.<br>
<br>
Exercises of both pairings are fallible. The first, mundane pairing is fallible because both <br>
perceptual states could be mis-perceptions, even referential illusions. Or one perception <br>
could be veridical, while the other is not (because the scene relevantly changes, but the <br>
way of perceiving does not). Many Fregean identities of the form <i>a = a</i> are also fallible. <br>
They can be untrue because there is a failure of reference by the singular representational <br>
content that substitutes for ‘<i>a</i>’.205 If the singular term is complex and involves <br>
demonstrative-type reference, the reference can succeed even though one or more of the <br>
attributives in the complex is not true of the referred-to entity. The second, non-mundane <br>
pairing is obviously also fallible.<br>
<br>
If all four perceptual states are accurate, the second pairing is more informative than <br>
the mundane pairing. It constitutes a perceptual achievement that differs in <i>perceptual</i> <br>
information value from the first. Analogies to Frege’s distinction between <i>a = a</i> identity <br>
thoughts and more informative <i>a = b</i> identity thoughts seem clear.<br>
<br>
One cannot account for the non-trivial exercise of a perceptual constancy in the second <br>
perceptual pairing by citing the fact that the achievement consists in veridically applying a <br>
single perceptual attributive prompted by diverse proximal inputs. Appealing to diversity <br>
of proximal inputs does not explain the difference in <i>perceptual</i> states, or the difference in <br>
<i>perceptual</i> information value. The achievement cannot be explained in terms of a bare dif-<br>
ference in referential applications of exactly the same attributives. For it is simply not true <br>
that the perceiver perceives the color shade, in all relevant <i>perceptual</i> respects, in the same <br>
ability-general way. The exercise of a non-trivial perceptual constancy for attributes <br>
involves exercise of one of many different inter-related psychological capacities—exercise <br>
of one of many different perceptual state-types. The difference resides in different percep-<br>
tual attributives for the constant attribute.<br>
<br>
A consideration that supports recognizing different perceptual attributives in exercises <br>
of perceptual constancies concerns ways in which different perceptual state-instances <br>
enter into different law-like representational psychological patterns. Perceptual represen-<br>
tational contents help individuate perceptual states. They help constitute basic perceptual <br>
kinds. The representational differences between instances in the second pair of percep-<br>
tions figure in psychological explanation. Pairings of the first, mundane type might be <br>
more likely to be accurate than pairings of the second type. The fourth member of the <br>
pairings (the response to <i>C</i> in blue light) might be slower or less easily retained in memory, <br>
and less likely to be accurate. Such differences in psychological patterns evince different <br>
kinds of <i>perceptual</i> states. Since the explanatory kinds are differentiated by <br><br>

<b>FOOTNOTES</b><br>
<b>Cont FN</b>205 Of course, thoughts can be false if different applications of demonstrative elements occur on the two sides <br>
of the identity. A use of that group of bodies numbering two is identical with that group of bodies numbering <br>
two can be false. Specifically, if the thought is not conceived as an assertion of self-identity, and the second noun <br>
phrase is taken as involving a second demonstrative act based on a later perception than the first, the instance of <br>
such an identity schema can be false. Suppose that the pair of bodies referred to by the first demonstrative disap-<br>
pears while an illusion of the first pair remains when the second demonstrative is applied. Or a thought that <br>
instantiates that form can be false if the first demonstrative is applied to one group of bodies and the second is <br>
applied to another identically appearing group that replaces the first group, unbeknownst to the thinker. None of <br>
these cases is of the form <i>a = a</i>. Applications of the demonstratives on the two sides of the identity predicate must <br>
be distinguished.</div>
