160  Form and Semantics of Perceptual Contents</div>
<br><br>
For example, an occurrence of light transmission might reflect off a particular surface into <br>
the eyes, causing, through stages of registration, an occurrent perceptual state and, more <br>
specifically, a particular occurrent referential application. Only particulars, only entities <br>
that occurrently enter into causal relations with a perceptual state occurrence (or concrete, <br>
particular aspects of a perceptual state) are perceived, or perceptually referred to. This is a <br>
reason why attribute-<i>types</i> are not perceived. The types are, of course, factors represented <br>
in causal explanation. They are not occurrent causes.<br>
<br>
These three points derive from reflection on the representational function of perception <br>
and on the fact that perception is sensory. It is a cause-dependent form of representation.<br>
<br>
The Aristotelian tradition saw a long metaphysical dispute. The dispute was over <br>
whether there are tropes, or instances of properties. Philosophers differed on whether in <br>
addition to (1) bearers of properties, which instantiate kind-type attributes (for example, a <br>
particular body or event) and (2) attribute-types, there are (3) instances of property-types <br>
and relation-types<i>—tropes</i>.<br>
<br>
There are three types of attribute-types: (a) the kind-type attribute, such as the attribute <br>
of being a body, surface, or event; (b) the feature-type or property-type attribute, such as <br>
that of being a specific color, shape, or size; and (c) the relation-type attribute, such as the <br>
attribute of being farther than or next to. It was mostly agreed that there are instances of <br>
the kind-type attributes. A body instantiates the kind-type attribute <i>body</i>. An event instan-<br>
tiates the kind-type (or kind-type attribute) <i>event.</i> A gas is an instance of the kind-type <br>
<i>gas</i>. Apart from a few radical nominalists, it was mostly agreed that there are attribute-<br>
<i>types</i> of the three sorts (a)–(c).<br>
<br>
The metaphysical dispute was over whether feature-types or property-types and <br>
relation-types have instances. For example, it was disputed whether there is an instance of <br>
the feature-property <i>brown</i>—an instance that is the particular brown <i>in</i> a given body, or <br>
that otherwise modifies the body. Similarly, it was disputed whether there is an <i>instance</i> of <br>
the shape-property-type <i>cubical</i> that occurs <i>in</i> a given body, or an <i>instance</i> of the spatial <br>
relation <i>3-handwidths-from</i> that holds between two given bodies. The types were uncon-<br>
troversial; their instances were disputed.<br>
<br>
Proponents of the trope-favoring position held, plausibly, that a feature trope never <br>
actually occurs <i>apart</i> from some bearer, and that relation tropes never occur apart from <br>
<i>relata</i> that enter into a relation. Thus a trope of <i>brown</i> never occurs except as the color of <br>
some material entity or entities (whatever metaphysical position was taken on the nature <br>
of color). A trope or instance of <i>cubical</i> never occurs except as a shape of something that <br>
<i>has</i> the shape. A trope of the relation <i>next to</i> never occurs except insofar as two particulars <br>
are next to one another. In pure mathematics there are only types, not tropes of the types. <br>
I accept these assumptions.<br>
<br>
Tropes are not identical with their property-types or relation-types. Feature tropes are <br>
local to a given place, time, and bearer. Feature-types are not. Feature tropes are not iden-<br>
tical with kind tropes—their bearers, the entities that they are properties of (say, bodies). <br>
A given body could change color or shape—lose one color trope or shape trope—and <br>
gain another.<br>
<br>
So the dispute was over whether there are three categories of entities or two. The two <br>
agreed-upon categories are (1) instances of the kind-types and (2a) kind-types, (2b) feature-<br>
like property-types, and (2c) relation-types, which I bundle together as (2) attribute-types. <br>
The instances of kind-types have or “bear” feature-type properties and enter into types of </div>
