properties outside that area is affected if those properties have been selected in advance—<br>
for example, in visual search.734<br>
<br>
Like spatial attention, feature-based attention can be overt or covert, exogenous or <br>
endogenous. Endogenous feature-based attention seems to be supported by feedback sig-<br>
nals from the pre-frontal cortex.735 When triggered by a stimulus, endogenous feature-<br>
based attention is applied slightly later than spatial attention.736 Both types can affect <br>
visual processing at early, middle, and late anatomical stages (from V1 through IT).737<br>
<br>
Feature-based attention commands can be either schematic, as they are in visual search, <br>
or <i>de re</i>, as in perception of features or tropes. The representational form of schematic and <br>
<i>de re</i> feature-based attention commands are:<br><br>
Attend: (that x)(that y)(brownr1(i)(x), cubicalb3(i)(y))<br><br>
and<br><br>
Attend: (that x1)(that x2)(brownr1(i)(x1), cubicalb3(i)(x2))<br><br>
<i>Object-based attention</i> applies to objects—property-bearers—as wholes.738 <i>Objects</i> can <br>
be lines, surfaces, bodies, parts of bodies, groups. Psychological work explored spatial <br>
attention before it explored object-based attention. A method of distinguishing object-<br>
based attention from spatial attention used a paradigm similar to the one that distin-<br>
guished feature-based attention from spatial attention: Subjects were asked to attend to <br>
certain objects (say, people playing a game) in a situation in which other subjects doing <br>
something different occupied substantially the same space. Attention to one set of objects <br>
seemed to block current awareness and memory of the other.739<br>
<br>
Object-based attention involves and is made possible by feature-based attention. This <br>
point is a cousin of Chapter 5’s point that one cannot visually pick out a particular without <br>
attributing a property. Higher-level perceptual attributives for kinds like <i>surface</i> and <i>ani-<br>
mal</i> cannot be formed unless one attributes other properties, especially spatial or motion <br>
application-base properties.740<br><br>
