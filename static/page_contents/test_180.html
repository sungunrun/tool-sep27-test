180  Form and Semantics of Perceptual Contents</div>
<br><br>
(∀x)[F(x) → (∃y)G(y)]<br><br>
and<br><br>
(∀x)(Ey)[F(x) → G(y)]<br><br>
are truth-conditionally equivalent, even though the scope of the existential quantifier dif-<br>
fers in the two cases. Scope differences that are not associated with differences in condi-<br>
tions that make a sentence or proposition true are sometimes called ‘notational variants’. <br>
The idea is that notations express a single “content”. Usually, there is not much discussion <br>
of exactly what is meant by ‘notational variant’ or ‘content’. Often, content is assumed, in <br>
discourse about formal logic, to be the same if the same conditions in the world make two <br>
notational variants either true or false.<br>
<br>
Scope is not only a factor in sentences or propositional structures. It also figures in <br>
noun phrases. In ‘the woman who loved the man’, the determiner governing ‘woman’ has <br>
wider scope than the determiner governing ‘man’. As we have seen, there are natural-<br>
language noun phrases, containing no subordinate clause, with multiple determiners shar-<br>
ing widest scope: ‘that body and <i>that</i> body, the first being next to the second’. Although <br>
this phrase is grammatical, a phrase with a single wide-scope determiner is more natural <br>
and more frequently used: ‘that body next to <i>that</i> body’. Here there is just one determiner <br>
with widest scope.<br>
<br>
It may appear that scope is of no significance in perceptual representational content. <br>
There are only two kinds of perceptual determiner—demonstrative-like determiners <br>
analogous to ‘that’, ‘this’, or ‘those’, and egocentric indexical determiners analogous to <br>
 ‘ego-here’ and ‘ego-now’. There are no logical constants, or other operators.<br>
<br>
In our stock example:<br><br>
(that x1)[(that x2)(that x3)(brown(c)(x1), brown(i)(x2), cubical(c)(x1), cubical(i)(x3), <br>
<br>
body(i)(x1))],<br><br>
the referential application (that x1) has wider scope than the referential applications, <br>
(that x2) and (that x3), which function to apply to perceived instances of <i>brown</i> and <i>cubical</i>. <br>
Although there are no propositional connectives in perception, putting together attribu-<br>
tions in a perceptual representational content is a non-propositional analog of conjunc-<br>
tion. So the illustrated form of the perceptual representational content is broadly <br>
analogous to<br><br>
(∃z)[(∃x)(∃y)(brown(x) & cubical(y) & brown(z) & cubical(z) & body(z))].<br><br>
This form is equivalent to both<br><br>
(∃z)(∃x)(∃y)(brown(x) & cubical(y) & brown(z) & cubical(z) & body(z))<br><br>
and<br><br>
(∃x)(∃y)(∃z)(brown(x) & cubical(y) & brown(z) & cubical(z) & body(z)).</div>
