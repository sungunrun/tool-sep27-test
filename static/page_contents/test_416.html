account satisfying. Both involve serious oversimplifications. (For more discussion, see <br>
Chapter 14, the section Broader Structure of Conation in Causing <br>
Relatively Primitive Action, note 711.) Neither stream is entirely specialized as <br>
these views  suggest.498 There are cross-projections between the streams from V2 onward.<br>
<br>
In feed-forward processing, V2 is strongly fed by V1 and strongly feeds areas V3 and <br>
V4. In feedback processing, V2 feeds V1. V2-V3 have not received nearly the scientific <br>
attention that V1 has received. Like V1, V2 is tuned to orientation, spatial frequency, and <br>
color. It is also an early basis for production of illusory contours made famous by Kanizsa <br>
triangles.499 Some depth, figure-ground, and contour connection that transpires in feed-<br>
forward processing is enabled by V2.500<br>
<br>
There is less agreement about anatomical divisions and functions of V3. V3 lies <br>
immediately in front of V2 in the occipital lobe. The term is usually applied to dorsal <br>
and ventral areas, in left and right hemispheres, though focus has been on dorsal V3. V3 <br>
has tunings similar to V1 and V2, with more emphasis on orientation and motion than <br>
on color.501<br>
<br>
V4 was one of the first early-vision areas to be studied for the feedback effects of <br>
en dogen ous attention. V4 receives direct input from V2 and V1. V4 is, like V1 and V2, <br>
tuned to orientation, spatial frequency, and color. In feed-forward processing, V4 enables <br><br>
