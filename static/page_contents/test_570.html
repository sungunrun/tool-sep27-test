570 Perceptual Memory: Short-Term Systems</div>
<br><br>
Chapter 10 illustrated how retrieval problems leave originally phenomenally conscious <br>
elements inaccessible to later retrieval. Such cases are not limited to change detection fail-<br>
ures. They occur in the normal run of short-term memory processing. There is reason to <br>
think that some of these <i>de facto</i> rationally inaccessible elements were phenomenally con-<br>
scious. They are often so short-lived that they are never accessed by, or accessible to, higher <br>
powers—never become cognitive-access or rational-access conscious.811<br>
<br>
None of my primary points regarding perceptual memory depend on whether any <br>
given states are phenomenally conscious or access conscious.<br><br>

<b>Priming and Memory<br><br>
</div>
</b>Priming is one of the most primitive operations studied in psychology. If one has been <br>
exposed to a visual stimulus, the processing of a later similar stimulus tends to be affected. <br>
Usually processing is speeded or otherwise enhanced. Priming can guide attention, but <br>
need not. Much priming is pre-representational. It affects only non-perceptual <br>
information-registration. When priming affects perceptual states, it can depend on mem-<br>
ory, initially short-term memory.812<br>
<br>
Priming normally operates via retention of a stimulus at least until onset of a later <br>
stimulus. There is evidence that memory involved in priming representational states dif-<br>
fers from consciously accessible types of memory. Memory involved in priming is doubly <br>
dissociable from consciously accessible memory. In pathological cases, priming can oper-<br>
ate even if one has no recollection, or perhaps even conscious perception, of the priming <br>
stimulus.813 In pathological cases, priming memory can fail even if consciously accessible <br>
memory of a stimulus is intact.814<br>
<br>
The distinction between priming’s producing an unconscious short-term memory that <br>
then affects future perception and priming’s directly resetting perceptual receptors is deli-<br>
cate. Psychophysical and neural evidence suggests, however, that in most cases of even the <br>
most primitive perceptual priming, retention of a past stimulus and settings in the percep-<br>
tual system itself are distinguishable. When perceptual settings change through priming, <br>
the change is often mediated by perceptual memory. I assume the standard interpretation <br><br>

<b>FOOTNOTES</b><br>
<b>FN</b>811 Since I focus on the structure and main features of the representational content of perception and percep-<br>
tual memory, I refer only briefly to empirical considerations that favor the views about consciousness sketched <br>
here. Some philosophers and a few psychologists reject Block’s insightful distinction. I believe that nearly all the <br>
resistance, though sometimes vociferous, is substantively weak—often question-begging. The philosopher who <br>
provided the first plausible, what-it-is-like explication of phenomenal consciousness is T. Nagel, ‘What It is Like <br>
to be a Bat’, <i>Philosophical Review</i> 83 (1974), 435–450. The philosopher who originally drew the distinction (here <br>
somewhat refined) between phenomenal consciousness and access consciousness is Block. Block marshaled <br>
impressive empirical support for actual instances of the distinction. See N. Block, ‘On a Confusion about a <br>
Function of Consciousness’, <i>Behavioral and Brain Sciences</i> 18 (1995), 227–247; Block, ‘Consciousness and <br>
Cognitive Access’; Block, ‘Perceptual Consciousness Overflows Cognitive Access’. For refinement of Block’s dis-<br>
tinction, see T. Burge, ‘Two Kinds of Consciousness’, in N. Block, O. Flanigan, and G. Güzeldere eds., <i>The Nature <br>
of Consciousness</i> (Cambridge, MA: The MIT Press, 1997), reprinted in Burge, <i>Foundations of Mind. Philosophical <br>
