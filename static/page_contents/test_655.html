<b>Fodor and Pylyshyn’s Conceptions of Modularity;  <br>
<br>
The Visual System as a Module<br><br>
</div>
</b>In 1983, reacting to New Look psychology, Jerry Fodor offered a vivid conception of <br>
“input systems” as psychological <i>modules</i>. The conception was supposed to provide an <br>
empirical basis for rejecting claims that perception is theory-laden.1060 New Look psych-<br>
ology was already fading when Fodor wrote. His work on modularity summarized and <br>
synthesized a lot of empirical work in the heady early days of computational psychology. <br>
Fodor’s work came, in turn, to influence empirical work. His discussion of modularity is <br>
an important contribution to both psychology and philosophy of psychology. It offered <br>
tools for understanding psychological kinds.<br>
<br>
Fodor cites nine marks of modularity.<br>
<br>
First, input systems are <i>domain specific</i>. The processing mechanisms are specialized in <br>
having constraints either on the range of information that they can access, or on the range <br>
of distal properties they can represent, or both.1061 Fodor is flexible and largely non-<br>
committal on what to count as specialized processing mechanisms. He allows perceptual <br>
systems that receive inter-modal input to count, for example. He suggests that the process <br>
for color perception, or shape perception, or hybrid systems that function to guide motor <br>
activity through vision, might count as specialized, domain specific systems. These are <br>
clearly overlapping systems.<br>
<br>
Second, the operations of the system are <i>mandatory</i>, given relevant input. Fodor cites <br>
non-normal cases in which the condition is not met. He claims, however, a large difference <br>
between perception and thought. Some thought is obsessional. Some proceeds uncon-<br>
sciously, beyond one’s control. But much is under executive control. Often, one can start or <br>
stop thinking, as one pleases. Although one can decide to prevent input into a perceptual <br>
system by closing one’s eyes, one cannot shut off perceptual processing to its natural per-<br>
ceptual outputs, once input occurs.<br>
<br>
Third, individuals have only <i>limited access</i> to the mental representations that input sys-<br>
tems compute. Fodor states, as a first approximation, that one is conscious of only the final <br>
output of the system—for example, a conscious visual perception. Representations com-<br>
puted along the way are either inaccessible, or accessible only with considerable difficulty.<br>
<br>
Fourth, input systems’ processing is <i>fast</i>. Fodor contrasts the slowness of conscious <br>
thought with fast computations of perceptual systems. He conjectures that computations <br>
by input systems are fast because they are mandatory.1062<br>
<br>
Fifth, input systems are <i>informationally encapsulated</i>. Fodor’s first formulation of this <br>
mark is modest:<br><br>
. . . the claim that input systems are informationally encapsulated is equivalent to the claim <br>
<br>
that the data that can bear on the confirmation of perceptual hypotheses includes, in the <br>
<br>
general case, considerably less than the organism may know. That is, the confirmation <br>
<br>
function for input systems does not have access to all the information that the organism <br><br>
