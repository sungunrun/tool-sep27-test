244 Attributives, Referential Applications in Constancies</div>

in discrimination, priming, action guidance, timing, and so on. In a perceptual con-<br>
stancy, the connection among linked attributives is not just the “vertical” one of being <br>
semantically connected to the same attribute. There is also a “horizontal” psychological <br>
connection among the different attributives that are semantically connected to the same <br>
environmental attribute.<br><br>

<b>Accuracy Conditions for Perceptual Attributives in Perceptual Constancies<br><br>
</div>
</b>An accuracy condition for a perceptual representational content is stated simply:<br><br>
An instance of a perceptual state is accurate if and only if: all referential applications in the <br>
state’s representational content (including any that fix an egocentric anchor for a spatial or <br>
temporal framework) refer; all attributives indicate an attribute; and all referred-to par-<br>
ticulars have all attributes attributed to them.<br><br>
The accuracy condition set by<br><br>
(that x1)[(that x2)(brownr1(c)(x1), brownr1(i)(x2), bodyd1(i)(x1))]<br><br>
can be glossed as follows.<br><br>
A perceptual-state-instance with the displayed representational content is accurate if <br>
<br>
and only if referential applications (that x1) and (that x2) each refer to a perceived par-<br>
<br>
ticular; there are attributes <i>brown</i> and <i>body</i> that are indicated by the attributives brownr1 <br>
<br>
and bodyd1; the particular referred to by (that x2) is an instance of the property <i>brown</i>; <br>
<br>
and the particular referred to by (that x1) is a body and has the property <i>brown</i>.225<br><br>
I believe that such a gloss is complete. I discuss a temptation to go further.<br>
<br>
Imagine three drawings. Each is to represent, as accurately as possible, the scene with <br>
the brown surface that confronts the artist. In the first, a brown surface is presented in <br>
white light; the drawing is fully accurate of the specific shade of brown. In the second, the <br>
color-shade occurs in red light; the drawing exactly matches the first drawing. In the third, <br>
the color-shade occurs in red light; the drawing represents the brown surface as brown, <br>
and in a way appropriate to its being red-lit. Although the second drawing draws the <br>
brownness of the patch, there is a sense in which it is not fully accurate. It is inaccurate <br>
even though it draws the color shade that the surface in fact has.<br>
<br>
One might think that an analogous point applies to perception: Accurately perceiving a <br>
brown color-shade requires representing it in a way appropriate to its being lit as it is in <br>
fact lit. Representational contents set veridicality conditions. So, on this view, the represen-<br>
tational content corresponding to the second drawing is inaccurate even though it meets <br>
the accuracy condition set out at the outset of this section. The inaccuracy of the second <br><br>

<b>FOOTNOTES</b><br>
<b>Cont FN</b>225 I assume the following principle: an attributive that engages in cross-attribute attribution, attributes not <br>
only the property-type that it indicates, but also the property-instance that it betokens. I have not introduced <br>
symbols for attribution of property tokens. I assume the two types of attribution to go together.</div>
