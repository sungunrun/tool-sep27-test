associates. In fact, they are instances of a broadly perceptual-level kind. Chapters 14–18 <br>
point toward an argument, in Chapter 19, that all are part of a single perceptual system <br>
and perceptual-motor system.<br>
<br>
Of course, the seven mentioned capacities also have cognitive-level, certainly <br>
propositional-level, sub-species. We make choices and form plans guided by propositional <br>
reasoning. We remember and learn higher mathematics. We attend to instructions in lab <br>
experiments and to political arguments and hypocrisies. We anticipate and predict future <br>
events—in science and common sense—on the basis of extensive background knowledge. <br>
We imagine complex narratives. We have emotions informed by broad conceptions of how <br>
things are.<br>
<br>
I focus on lower-level species of the generic capacities. Philosophy is not accustomed to <br>
focusing on these species. It tends to overlook them. Little is said about how higher-and <br>
lower-level species of these genera interact with perception. Even scientists have not devel-<br>
oped the vocabulary or the distinctions needed to mark differences between the lower-<br>
level and higher-level species. In Chapter 19, I discuss ways careless use of key terms has <br>
led to confusion about psychological kinds. Psychological science does, however, show <br>
that lower-level species are distinct from higher-level counterparts. Perception, its auxil-<br>
iary capacities, and higher-level capacities need better scientific and conceptual grounding <br>
if progress is to be made.<br>
<br>
Often, each of these capacities is counted “cognitive” in a sense that is meant to indicate <br>
that cognition is a higher level of representation than perception. This practice is miscon-<br>
ceived. I argue that conation, the executive control system, attention, memory, anticipa-<br>
tion, learning, imagining, and affect are <i>generic</i> psychological kinds with species at <br>
different levels of psychological sophistication. Each has a perceptual-level species. Each of <br>
the generic capacities also has one or more supra-perceptual-level species. I think that a <br>
perceptual-level species of each generic capacity is a part of a single perceptual-motor sys-<br>
tem. I continue to focus on the visual aspects of this system. So, for example, conative <br>
states guided by visual perception and visual perceptual memory are part of the visual-<br>
perceptual-motor system.<br>
<br>
The listed perceptual-level capacities are not themselves capacities for perception. <br>
I explain why they are not supra-perceptual. Inevitably, I discuss these capacities some-<br>
what cursorily. The point of Chapters 14–18 is to provide an appreciation for a perceptual <br>
level within each of the listed generical capacities. This level is first characterized function-<br>
ally. For example, <i>perceptual</i>(-level) memory is memory that functions to retain perceptual <br>
contents, centrally perceptual attributives. I encourage thinking of <i>perceptual</i> memory as a <br>
distinctive capacity that interacts with perceptual processing and with other types of <br>
perceptual-level capacities. I do not at all take it to be causally sealed off from conceptual <br>
memory or from other conceptual-level capacities. However, in Chapter 19, I discuss a <br>
not-purely-functional way in which all perceptual-level capacities’ relations to perception <br>
and to one another differ from their relations to conceptual-level capacities. Their rela-<br>
tions to conceptual-level capacities are not part of a certain computational system.<br>
<br>
The point (Chapter 9, the section Iconic Aspects of Perceptual Spatial <br>
Representation—see notes 326–329), that perception shares an iconic format with <br>
perceptual working memory, perceptual long-term memory, and perceptual imagery sug-<br>
gests that these capacities share representational structure, as well as attributive content, </div>
