visual processing areas. Although FEF does not project significantly to V1, it provides <br>
feedback to MT/V5. Notably, it also provides input, taken to be <i>feed-forward input</i>, to V4. It <br>
also affects IT (infero-temporal cortex) via its effect on V4.<br>
<br>
Recall that V4 is probably the earliest area that supports spatial perceptual constancies. <br>
Attention initiated in FEF aids object representation, via V4’s effects on IT. As noted in <br>
Chapters 10-11, endogenous attention, including that supported in FEF, is not necessary <br>
for the first perceptual representations supported in V4 and IT. But it is an early atten-<br>
tional supplementation that enhances and directs perceptual representations. Most <br>
en dogen ous attention shifts supported in FEF bear on whole-individual action and reac-<br>
tion. The eye shifts that they guide serve such action and reaction. So attention initiations <br>
supported in FEF are relevant both to determining direction and amplitude of saccades <br>
and to helping to enhance visual perception.781<br>
<br>
The schema for understanding saccades set out in the second paragraph of this section is <br>
an oversimplification. <i>Express saccades</i>, which are initiated in the superior colliculus—a <br>
sub-cortical brain area that coordinates with FEF—, can occur much faster than at 330 ms <br>
intervals. In monkeys they can occur at 70 ms. In humans, at 90 ms.782 At their fastest, they <br>
reflect the earliest visually (exogenously) triggered eye movements. Their timings approach <br>
the minimum loop required to transform a retinal input into an ocular-motor response.<br>
<br>
The speeds at which both exogenous and endogenous attention shifts and at which both <br>
normal and express saccades, which are guided by such attention, occur vary with whether <br>
there is anticipation, deriving from priming or other memory-based representation. The <br>
speed of saccades is thought to depend partly on pre-stimulus anticipatory activity in the <br>
superior colliculus. Highest speed in both ordinary and express saccades also occurs with <br>
simple, easy-to-process stimuli. For example, well-illuminated scenes with few distractors <br>
are resolved faster, and allow faster attention shifts and saccades, than poorly illuminated <br>
scenes with many distractors. Speed of attentional influence on V4 by FEF also varies with <br>
these factors.783<br>
<br>
A further complication of the simple schema is that even during fixation, there are con-<br>
tinuous <i>microsaccades</i>. A microsaccade is a type of small, automatic, binocular eye move-<br>
ment. They occur much more frequently than the larger saccades that occur, on average, <br>
every 330 ms. Microsaccades share the general neural circuitry of larger saccades. The <br><br>
