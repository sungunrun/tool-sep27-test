</i>I conclude by looking back to some main themes and looking forward to issues shaped by <br>
them. Little in the conclusion is conclusive. I hope that the less conclusive aspects are like <br>
the sketches that first-formed perception provides: generic shapes and generic categories <br>
that form a basis for filling in, refinement, and correction.<br><br>

<b>Emergence of Representational Mind<br><br>
</div>
</b>The key event that forms the background for the foregoing account is emergence of per-<br>
ception as a distinct form of sensing. This form is distinguished by states’ having natures <br>
that set specific conditions for being accurate with respect to the environment.<br>
<br>
Such accuracy conditions are not conditions for biological success. All sensory states <br>
have biological functions to enable individuals to negotiate the world well enough to sur-<br>
vive and reproduce. A sensory state’s having accuracy conditions involves having a further <br>
function, beyond its biological ones. Biological functions are all broadly practical. The <br>
accuracy of perceptual states, though often co-opted by biological processes as a tool for <br>
biological success, is not fundamentally a practical success, hence not a realization, in <br>
itself, of a biological function. Accuracy is a representational success—fulfillment of a rep-<br>
resentational function. A perceptual state meets with a real success if it is accurate, even if <br>
the state contributes to biological failure.<br>
<br>
Perception exhibits a new type of function—a representational function. Functions <br>
bring with them norms: standards for success in realizing the function, either fully or in <br>
some respect.<br>
<br>
Emergence of a new kind of function and norm marks emergence of a new kind of <br>
competence. The new functions and norms are grounded in the capacity, <i>representation</i>. <br>
Representation differs from information registration—a competence involved in sensory, <br>
even sensitive, states generally. In the living world, information registration is co-variation <br>
between instances of a type of state in an organism and instances of attributes of causes <br>
of those state-instances, where the co-variation has a biological function. Lots of causal <br>
co-variations are functional for each sensory state. Not only various environmental types, <br>
but proximal stimuli, and various causes in the organism functionally co-vary, to various </div>
