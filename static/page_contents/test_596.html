596 Perceptual Memory: Short-Term Systems</div>
<br><br>
Evidence that VWM plays this role is varied and solid. For example, a concurrent repre-<br>
sentational load in VWM interferes with the efficiency of searches, unless representations <br>
of features of the search target repeat over many trials and need not be maintained in <br>
VWM.894 Complex searches for multiple objects correlate well with establishing multiple <br>
templates that guide attention to the objects.895 There is also neurological evidence. <br>
Neurological correlates of maintenance of VWM are active through visual search. Higher <br>
amplitudes of activity correlate with search success.896 Finally, the phenomenon of <br>
memory-driven capture evinces VWM’s role in visual search. Participants are asked to <br>
memorize a priming item, such as a red rectangle. The red rectangle might be either a <br>
search target or a distractor in a subsequent search display. Targets and distractors are <br>
easily discriminable. A target might even be a one-of-a-kind in the display, and thus sub-<br>
ject to pop-out. Nevertheless, even if the prime in working memory is a distractor, not a <br>
target, it normally affects the latency and direction of eye movement.897 The memory-<br>
driven capture effect evinces a close relation between VWM and direction of attention in <br>
visual search. Normally, outside the laboratory, when what is held in working memory <br>
specifies a target, memory-driven capture aids direction of attention to searched-for <br>
targets.<br>
<br>
Similar evidence supports taking VWM to support extended tracking of moving <br>
objects, including multiple-object tracking, a close analog of visual search.898<br>
<br>
In all these cases, one should distinguish VWM, a system for retention, from attention. <br>
The retention and the initiations of attention have been shown to be distinct.899 There is <br>
evidence that dissociates retention from functions of executive control, such as suppres-<br>
sion of distractors.900<br>
<br>
VWM functions not only to retain information but also to guide action. VWM figures in <br>
navigation—in tracking objects, object location, and object relations, as an individual  <br>
moves.901<br><br>
