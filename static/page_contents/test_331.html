</b>Is perception constitutively iconic? I see no reason why it should be impossible to con-<br>
struct an artificial robotic system that issued in perceptual constancies and that guided <br>
action. Although the sensory registrations that, through transformations, produce the <br>
perceptual states would be iconic, a robot could be constructed so that the first perceptual <br>
states embedded in perceptual constancies consisted of non-iconic, symbolic readouts: <br>
having the singular-term form and function of perception. So I do not see why perceptual <br>
states must be iconic.<br>
<br>
I believe, however, that any <i>natural sensory information registration</i> necessarily takes <br>
iconic form. For natural sensory information registration constitutively makes use of the <br>
causal patterns of nature in its causal, functional co-variation. Pre-perceptual sensory <br>
states are just the natural effects of what they function to sense. Where there are also sys-<br>
tematic relational effects—such as stronger sensory responses and actional responses with <br>
stronger stimulation, or registration of stimulus direction via the natural layout of the <br>
 sensory receptors, there will again be a natural mapping relation between pre-perceptual <br>
sensory registration and what is registered.<br>
<br>
Any <i>natural perceptual system</i> must use its underlying sensory-information-registration <br>
system in its representation of the world. Such a system’s representation involves a selec-<br>
tion of particulars from those already sensed. An individual senses the light that immedi-<br>
ately causes the retinal image. The individual also senses, via that light, distal environmental <br>
causes or reflectors of that light. In perception, a distal environmental cause, but not the <br>
proximal light stimulus—the retinal image—is represented. Through the attributive <br>
capacities embedded in perceptual constancies, such a distal environmental cause is <br>
selected. So natural perception is a selection (through perceptual objectification) from <br>
among entities already sensed and informationally registered. The pre-perceptual sensory <br>
states are used in natural perceptual systems to help effect perceptual representation. More <br>
broadly, the natural relations among distal environmental causes, that corresponding <br>
iconic relations within pre-perceptual sensory responses are produced by, are, I think, <br>
necessarily used in <i>natural</i> perception. So the natural iconic pre-representational iconic <br>
patterns in sensing are re-used in natural perception. So a natural iconic mapping in both <br>
natural sensory information registration and natural perceptual representation is guaran-<br>
teed. (See the specification of iconic mappings in sensing and perceiving in this chapter, <br>
the section Noun-Phrase-Like Structure and Iconic Representation in <br>
Perception.)<br>
<br>
For example, the natural temporal ordering in a pre-perceptual sensing of temporally <br>
ordered events constitutes an iconic non-representational information registration of <br>
those events. The natural perceptual representation of temporal order that makes use of <br>
the pre-representational iconic mapping of temporal order of perceived changes will itself <br>
be iconic.<br>
<br>
So although artificial perceptual representation might avoid being iconic, I think that <br>
natural perceptual systems are constitutively iconic. Natural perception makes use of, but <br>
focuses and makes representationally specific (via perceptual objectification and percep-<br>
tual constancies) the iconic character of natural, pre-perceptual sensing and sensory <br>
information registration.</div>
