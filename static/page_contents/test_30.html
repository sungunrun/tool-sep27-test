psy cho logic al explanations. Explanations hinge on representational states identified by <br>
their veridicality conditions. The causal patterns into which <i>those</i> types enter is the central <br>
subject matter of the science.<br>
<br>
The point is not that perceptual psychology, specifically psychophysics, invokes <i>ver idi­<br>
cal ity</i> in its explanations. It is that it gives <i>causal</i> explanations in unreduced theoretical <br>
models that count states with <i>veridicality conditions</i> both causes and effects.24 The basic, <br>
unreduced causal explanations in a science indicate the basic natural kinds that the sci-<br>
ence is committed to. The basic kinds that a science is committed to are usually best taken <br>
to be the natural kinds that exist in the domain investigated by the science. No non-<br>
psychological science appeals to representational states with veridicality conditions as an <br>
aspect of their natures in its basic, unreduced causal explanations. Attempting to dispense <br>
with representation in favor of information registration is, as noted earlier, out of step with <br>
scientific explanations.<br>
<br>
Further, few perceptual psychologists would dispute the idea that explaining conditions <br>
under which veridical perceptual states and perceptual illusions occur is the, or a, central <br>
aim of the science. Visual perceptual psychology aims centrally to explain how we see.25 <br>
Seeing, according to mainstream perceptual psychology, is veridical visual perceptual <br>
representation.<br><br>

<b>Representations and Representational Contents<br><br>
</div>
</b>So far, I have distinguished representation from information registration. I explained what <br>
it is for a psychological state to be representational. We now need a technical notion that <br>
will figure prominently in our discussion. This is the concept <i>representational content</i>. This <br>
concept is best explained along with the concept <i>representation</i>, as in ‘a representation’. <br>
Psychological science often cites representations. It uses the term ‘representational con-<br>
tent’ more sparingly.<br>
<br>
Representations are <i>particulars</i>. That is, they are local to an individual who represents, <br>
and state-instance, at a time. Word occurrences and sentence occurrences are representa-<br>
tions. Particular maps and realist pictures are representations. I mainly discuss psy cho-<br>
logic al representations. Other sorts of representation always depend on being used by <br>
individuals that have psychological representations. Psychological representations are <br>
localized to a time and a mind, or a time and an individual’s psychological system. That is, <br>
if today at noon you think poachers are deplorable and I think poachers are deplorable <br>
at the same time, you and I use different representations, even though they are <br><br>

<b>FOOTNOTES</b><br>
<b>Cont FN</b>24 The point about the form of explanations in mainstream psychophysics is not reasonably disputable. <br>
Perceptual states are representations of distal conditions that are accurate or not insofar as they match distal <br>
conditions that they represent. Some work in psychophysics tries to determine the probability of accuracy of <br>
specific types of perceptual states in specific conditions. Such work sometimes proves optimality theorems that <br>
show that, given the limitations of the perceptual system (for example, the acuity of the lenses in the eyes and the <br>
amount of noise in the system), the system represents nearly as accurately as possible. See notes 57, 208, 719. <br>
These are not causal explanations, but they assume them. They are made available by the norm of accuracy, <br>
which is objectively in place if representational states are in place.<br>
