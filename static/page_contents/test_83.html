contour registration and contour perception 83</div>

processing. Neither type of registration is a perception, or an aspect of a perception. Each <br>
is the result of a pre-perceptual operation that provides input into processes that eventu-<br>
ally yield perceptions as of physical edges, such as edges of branches or rocks, or edges of <br>
color patterns on a surface. The operations so far described are not taken, in scientific the-<br>
ory, to yield perceptual constancies.<br>
<br>
The computations that lead to grouping registrations of contours of the retinal image <br>
were certainly molded by the distal environmental conditions that they also register and <br>
correspond to. Yet the groupings are not perceptual attributives that apply to en vir on men-<br>
tal contours. The environmental contours are in 3-D space. The registrations of contours <br>
in the retinal image, at this stage of processing, are arranged in a 2-D grid. They correlate <br>
best with patterns of sharp differences of light in the 2-D retinal image.<br>
<br>
Although they do not realize <i>perceptual</i> constancies, these operations yield states that are <br>
“constant” or invariant under different proximal stimulations. I want to move toward a more <br>
detailed understanding of why such invariances (“constancies”) are not perceptual constan-<br>
cies. Such understanding will illumine wherein perceptual constancies are a psychological <br>
kind. What distinguishes pre-perceptual invariances from perceptual constancies?<br>
<br>
It is worth reflecting on our example more closely. I describe a series of computational <br>
transformations that are known to lead to outcomes—in registrations of contours—that <br>
accord very well with actual human perceptual performance. There is evidence that the <br>
<i>outcomes</i> of these operations are implemented in mammalian, including human, visual <br>
systems. Some analogs of the operations occur in actual visual systems, though their exact <br>
form is not yet known. Nothing like a detailed account of the operations that visual sys-<br>
tems actually go through, or even the exact order in which they occur, is available in this <br>
case. Still, the present level of description (roughly a “computational” level)79 suggests the <br>
sorts of algorithms that mammalian systems go through in order to process and group <br>
registrations of contours in the retinal image.<br>
<br>
Roughly, <i>spatial frequency</i> corresponds to the amount of grain or detail that is re gis-<br>
tered per unit area in the retinal image. Spatial frequencies in a retinal image produced by <br>
a row of black-white pinstripe shirts are high. Spatial frequencies produced by a row of <br>
alternating white and black shirts are low. In principle, a given neuron could be sensitive <br>
to all spatial frequencies of light waves. However, neurons in the primary visual cortex <br>
V1—which operate as filters—are sensitive on average only to certain bandwidths of spa-<br>
tial frequency: 1.5 octaves. For convenience in setting out the computation, one can set a <br>
peak frequency of 0.1 wave cycles per smallest area of sensitivity. So at the start of compu-<br>
tation, operations are confined to spatial frequencies of light-wave registrations in this <br>
bandwidth and this peak frequency. High and low spatial frequencies outside of these <br>
ranges, are excluded from computational operations on the retinal image.<br>
<br>
The stages of the computation that lead to a registration of contours in the retinal image <br>
can be broken down into four operations.<br>
<br>
The first identifies sharp changes in registration of light intensity between adjacent <br>
smallest-discriminated regions of the retinal image. These sharp differences in registration <br>
correspond to sharp differences in luminance in the retinal image. For example, if there is <br>
a difference in registrations of dark grey light from registrations of white light between <br><br>
