Some Ways Not to Think about Iconic Representation 315</div>
<br><br>
Roughly, in much normal, foveal, stable visual perception of a scene, every smallest-<br>
discriminable part of a visual representation functions to represent some part of the scene, <br>
<i>modulo</i> blurring, defocus, and crowding, and laying aside the sketchiness of peripheral <br>
representation. Visual systems tend to “fill in” blind spots, or other analogs of missing <br>
pixels.333 Visual perception is something like a photograph or realist painting in which all <br>
or nearly all the smallest perceptually discriminated regions represent one or more fea-<br>
tures of the environment (including backgrounds, like the sky), at corresponding pos itions <br>
or ordinal depths in space.334<br>
<br>
To be iconic, a representation need not be like a filled-in realist painting. It can be like a <br>
sketch, with parts either blank or representing only rough spatial relations. In certain <br>
defective perceptions, in perceptions formed at very early computational stages, in periph-<br>
eral aspects of normal perception, and in much perceptual memory, the states are sketch-<br>
like. For example, initially produced, ultra-fast-processed visual perceptions represent the <br>
gist or main features of the scene, omitting textures, shape details, and other fine-grained <br>
aspects until further processing fills them in.335 Iconic representation in working memory <br>
retains only some types of information. Much of the richness of conscious, foveal percep-<br>
tual representations is neglected.<br>
<br>
Even packaging is not essential to a representation’s being iconic. Just as a color chit <br>
iconically represents a color, a perceptual state could represent a color-instance iconically <br>
without representing anything else. To be iconic, it need only meet the conditions of a <br>
natural representational mapping.<br>
<br>
A full account would distinguish between central, rich, filled-in representation and <br>
peripheral sketch-like representation. I mostly ignore the distinction in what follows.<br><br>

</b>Before going further, I criticize ways of thinking about iconicity that are influential in <br>
phil oso phy. These ways have included claims that iconic representation has no semantical <br>
structure, and that perception is not iconic. These errors derive partly from misconcep-<br>
tions about what it is to be iconic and partly from bad method in thinking about iconic <br>
representation. I begin by discussing pictures. The focus is ultimately on visual perception.<br>
<br>
The views that I criticize are centered in Jerry Fodor’s claims about iconic representa-<br>
tion. Fodor maintains, ‘it is having a canonical decomposition that distinguishes <br><br>

<b>Cont FN</b>333 Visual systems fill in missing “pixels”, regions (not necessarily smallest regions) of a representational con-<br>
tent that, due to defect, noise, or the like, do not provide any stimulus information that would normally be pro-<br>
vided. Such systems average among neighboring regions, using encoded statistics from natural scenes. <br>

1–17. Geisler and Perry’s examples are pre-perceptual. When the filling-in improves perception, the attributive is <br>
accurate <i>of</i> the relevant shape. But no instance of the relevant shape-part is perceived (or successfully picked out <br>
by a referential application). For no instance of the filled-in feature is, in such cases, causally responsible for the <br>
relevant representation.<br>
<br>
334 The different constituents of the perceptual content represent occupants of space with varying degrees of <br>
resolution. Foveal areas of vision are vastly more acute and rich than peripheral areas. So we are to imagine a <br>
comparison to a realist painting in which some parts of the painting are less sharply resolved than others.<br>
