individuals consistently fixate changed entities longer than unchanged ones, even if they <br>
fail to report the change.418<br>
<br>
Most failures of change detection do not derive from failures of perception. Most do not <br>
derive from failures of memory retention. They derive from difficulties in comparing dif-<br>
ferent perceptions in memory, from difficulties in bringing to consciousness memories <br>
that do represent the changes, and from the limited range of attention, which plays a large <br>
role in making perceived items available to consciousness in memory and available to <br>
comparison in memory.<br>
<br>
In many cases, perceptions that contain the information necessary to represent changes, <br>
and in some cases even perception of the changes, are stored unconsciously. Perception is <br>
not impoverished during change-detection failures.<br>
<br>
Even within saccades, vision yields representation of some generic and some specific <br>
3-D volume shapes, and distance and depth relations among them, in a 3-D spatial frame-<br>
work. There is representation of the scene’s spatial structure. Bodes are categorized by <br>
shapes, sizes, and motions. This initial perceptual representation is enriched by cumula-<br>
tion of representation across saccades. Over a period of a few seconds, a substantial part of <br>
the scene can be attended to. Attention to any given item makes change detection more <br>
likely, even after the item is no longer attended to. Still, a representation in perceptual <br>
memory that is not easily consciously accessible tends to be more detailed than what is <br>
consciously attended to in perception or easily accessible in perceptual memory.<br><br>

<b>Treisman’s Binding Theory<br><br>
</div>
</b>I turn to the third body of work, that of Anne Treisman. Recall that Treisman claimed that <br>
shape and color properties cannot be bound as properties of a single entity—and that such <br>
an entity, and indeed its properties, cannot be located in environmental space—except <br>
through applications of attention. Such applications were taken to be serial, not parallel.<br>
<br>
Treisman engaged in admirably sustained, systematic exploration of some striking phe-<br>
nomena. Illusory conjunctions are a symptom of the fact that certain ranges of information <br>
for types of features (color, shape) are processed by different mechanisms. The mechanisms <br>
are active in different areas of the brain. In certain conditions, absent attention, binding <br>
information from these different processes into a complex perception is unreliable.<br>
<br>
Attention does play a role in effecting or improving feature binding in certain cases. For <br>
example, search for a target defined by a conjunction of features is, under certain condi-<br>
tions, less efficient than search for targets defined by a single feature.419 Similarly, damage <br>
to certain brain areas specifically associated with allocation of attention increase illusory <br>
conjunctions.420<br><br>
