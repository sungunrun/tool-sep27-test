(ARG) Take a picture of a person, cut it into parts whichever way you like; still, each <br>
<br>
 picture part pictures a person part. And the whole that you have if you reassemble <br>
<br>
all the picture’s parts is a picture of the whole person that the parts of the picture are <br>
<br>
 pictures of.342<br><br>
As far as I can tell, (ARG) derives from Stephen Kosslyn, who writes: ‘Depictive represen-<br>
tations convey meaning via their resemblance to an object, with parts of the representa-<br>
tion corresponding to parts of the object. In this case, a “part” can be defined arbitrarily, <br>
cutting up the representation in any way; no matter how you cut it, the part will still <br>
 correspond to a part of the object . . .’.343<br>
<br>
PP(1) is false. The argument for it, based on (ARG), is unsound. The conclusions about <br>
the semantics of pictures that Fodor draws from the principle are mistaken. The claims <br>
(a)–(h) and the claim that iconic representations lack canonical decomposition are <br>
all false.<br>
<br>
I start with some small critical points. Though in themselves minor, they connect to <br>
deeper issues. In the second sentence of PP(1), Fodor can be charitably taken to mean that <br>
each picture part is a picture of a person or person part.344 This claim is clearly mistaken. <br>
Nearly all pictures of persons have parts that picture things that are not persons or person <br>
parts. Most pictures of people do not picture them naked. Parts of a picture that picture the <br>
buttons on the person’s shirt are not pictures of parts of the person. If a part of a picture <br>
represents a highlight on the person’s forehead, it does not represent a part of the person.<br>
<br>
Nearly all pictures of a person picture a background. PP(1) holds that for every picture <br>
of a person, the parts of the picture are pictures of parts of the person. Parts of the picture <br>
of a person that picture parts of the background do not picture parts of the person.<br>
<br>
PP(1) is false for many further reasons. For example, indiscernible micro-parts of the <br>
picture—molecules either beneath or on the surface—do not depict anything. Even some <br>
visually discerned parts of the surface of the picture do not represent anything. The barely <br>
discernible sides of a slightly raised speck of paint need not represent anything, if percep-<br>
tion discounts the contribution of such elements and if no one, including the painter and <br>
viewers, makes any use of their contribution to the look of the painting. Parts of surfaces <br>
that result from losses of paint usually do not represent anything.<br><br>

<b>Cont FN</b>342 Fodor, <i>LOT 2: The Language of Thought Revisited</i>, 173. The principle and the argument for it are also stated <br>
in J. Fodor’s ‘The Revenge of the Given’, in B. McLaughlin and J. Cohen eds., <i>Contemporary Debates in Philosophy <br>
of Mind</i> (Oxford: Blackwell, 2007), 108.<br>
<br>
343 Kosslyn’s idea is expressed in his <i>Image and Mind</i>, 33; and S. Kosslyn, <i>Image and Brain</i> (Cambridge, MA: <br>
Harvard University Press, 1994), 5. Surprisingly, Fodor does not credit Kosslyn. See also S. Kosslyn’s ‘Mental <br>
Representation’, in J. Anderson and S. Kosslyn eds., <i>Tutorials in Learning and Memory</i> (New York: W.H. Freeman <br>
and Company, 1984), 105–107. Kosslyn’s syntactical and semantical ideas are vulnerable to the same points <br>
I make against Fodor’s. For further expressions of the Kosslyn idea, see M. Tye, <i>The Imagery Debate</i> (Cambridge, <br>
MA: MIT Press, 1991), 44; D. Braddon-Mitchell and F. Jackson, <i>Philosophy of Mind and Cognition</i>: <i>An <br>
Introduction</i> (Oxford: Blackwell, 2nd edition, 2012), 179ff., where they claim, ‘there is no natural way of dividing <br>
a map at its truth-assessable representational joints’. Although Braddon-Mitchell and Jackson do not mention <br>
Fodor or Kosslyn, they echo the view, basing it on the claim that ‘there is no natural <i>minimum</i> unit of truth-<br>
assessable representation in the case of maps’. They present this view as if it were obvious. I discuss minimality of <br>
size below.<br>
<br>
344 Taken literally, the second sentence in (ARG) implies that all parts of a picture depict the person. A tiny <br>
picture part that depicts the left side of a button on a person’s coat does not depict the person. I assume that <br>
Fodor is simply careless here.</div><div id="PGHEADER">
