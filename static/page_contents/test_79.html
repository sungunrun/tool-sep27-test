path integration: another non-perceptual invariance 79</div>

common environmental attribute—a line in space with a certain length and direction. The <br>
states have the <i>functional</i> object relevance discussed earlier. Do such systems have percep-<br>
tual constancies? Do they in themselves represent spatial features, not just informationally <br>
register them?<br>
<br>
The answer to both questions is ‘no’. Such systems can be co-opted by perceptual sys-<br>
tems. Then they contribute to representation. However, it is a mistake, I think, to take path <br>
integration systems in themselves to have perceptual constancies or to set veridicality con-<br>
ditions for distance and direction, apart from input that independently exhibits perceptual <br>
constancies.<br>
<br>
Of course, a line in space is not perceived. Lines do not relevantly cause psychological <br>
states. They do not cause anything in a way relevant to understanding perception. Space <br>
and spatial <i>relations</i> are not perceived. Only particulars in space or in spatial relations are <br>
perceived. Spatial positions and relations lack relevant causal power. Spatial <i>properties</i> are <br>
perceived only if they are particularized in entities that have the properties. So the ques-<br>
tion is, ‘Are the spatial attributes that path integration tracks represented as attributes of <br>
perceived particulars?’ Path integration systems in themselves do not present particulars <br>
as being in space at all.<br>
<br>
Use of the non-perceptual sensory input into some path integration systems is fully <br>
accounted for in terms of information registration of proximal stimulation. Registration of <br>
summation of energy and summation of leg torque, each produced by walking in ants, and <br>
registration of constant retinal flow together with air pressure on the sides of bees, do not <br>
combine to present any particulars that occupy space. So path integration systems that <br>
lack perceptual input do not—indeed, cannot—yield perceptions of entities as having spa-<br>
tial features.<br>
<br>
This reasoning elaborates an earlier point about distance constancy. When invariances of <br>
distance or location are perceptual, they are framework constancies. They require perceptual <br>
representations of entities in spatial positions and in spatial relations. Invariances in path <br>
integration do not meet this standard. They are invariances, but not perceptual constancies.<br>
<br>
There is a further dissimilarity between relevant path integration systems and systems <br>
that yield perceptual constancies. The result of combining the inputs from non-perceptual <br>
sensory systems is at least as specific to a natural kind that is explained in terms of prox-<br>
imal stimulation as it is to a natural kind that would be explained in terms of representa-<br>
tion of space.<br>
<br>
Suppose that after reaching some food, an ant is prepared to walk the path integration <br>
vector back to the nest. The spatial vector that grounds explanation of the <i>function</i> of the <br>
ant’s sensory and motor states is a straight line <i>L</i> of length <i>D</i>. If the ant’s behavior were to <br>
be explained in causal-representational terms, in addition to purely functional-<br>
information-registrational terms, the anticipational state would represent that line, and <br>
the motor command would be: walk line <i>L</i> with length <i>D</i>. However, a simple natural prin-<br>
ciple (a motor-command analog) that centers not on spatial relations but on proximal <br>
stimulation from proprioception, would be: walk so as to minimize torque stress expend-<br>
ing amount of walking energy <i>E</i>. Minimizing torque stress in fact produces straight-line <br>
walking. Expending walking energy <i>E</i> in fact produces walking distance <i>D</i>.75<br><br>
