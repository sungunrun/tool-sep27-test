second-order attributional components. Complex propositional structures, like negations <br>
and conditions, always have propositional components in which a main-verb-phrase-like <br>
component scope-dominates noun-phrase components.<br>
<br>
This main-verb-phrase-like component is fundamentally attributive. Perception’s noun-<br>
phrase-like structures do not have a <i>main-</i>verb-phrase-like element, which is constitutive <br>
of propositional structures. All perceptual attributives are within the scope of contextual, <br>
referential applications—analogs of referential, nominal determiners. One or more refer-<br>
ential applications always have widest scope in any perceptual representational content. <br>
Again, this form reflects perception’s representational function—to pick out particulars.<br>
<br>
As shown in Chapter 5, the picking-out function is necessarily aided by competencies <br>
to characterize. The characterizations function to aid picking out. Not so, for at least one <br>
characterization in propositional structures. In propositional competencies, the compe-<br>
tence to characterize what is picked out can be exercised as a widest-scope attributive that <br>
comments on a particular independently picked out. Or the same competence that guides <br>
a <i>de re</i> picking out within a noun-phrase-like structure embedded (or embeddable) in a <br>
propositional structure can, in propositional competencies, provide a characterization <br>
that joins with a conditional, negational, or quantified structure that does not serve a pick-<br>
ing out at all. Perception does not involve a competence to characterize that is independ-<br>
ent of serving perceptual reference. This fact is reflected in the forms of perception: <br>
Attribution never scope-dominates all referential application. Perceptual competence <br>
grounds the non-propositional structure of perceptual content.<br>
<br>
There are <i>propositional</i> structures in which even the main-verb-phrase-like attributive <br>
has other <i>occurrences</i> in the structure that are dominated by a referential application. (See <br>
this chapter, the section Perception of Property-Instances.) Consider a percep-<br>
tual belief, that body is cubical, where the belief is directly derived from a perception as of <br>
a cubical body. The main-verb-phrase-like attributive in the belief is the attributive cu bic al. <br>
In its occurrence as main-verb-phrase-like attributive, it makes a cross-attribute attribu-<br>
tion of <i>cubical</i> to the referred-to body. Of course, it is outside the scope of any referential <br>
application. Supposing that the occurrence of cubical preserves the referential application <br>
of the underlying perception, it also functions to make an intra-attribute attribution of <br>
<i>cubical</i> to a trope of <i>cubical</i>. So both cross-and intra-attributions are carried out with the <br>
attributive cubical. These points are important, and so deserve elaboration.<br>
<br>
<i>De re</i> propositional beliefs that are directly based on perception, and that do not <br>
abstract from any referential applications of perceptual attributives that the thought con-<br>
ceptualizes, are psychologically the most basic propositional structures. They are struc-<br>
tures in which attributives <i>conceptualize</i> perceptual attributives. A conceptual at tribu tive <br>
<i>conceptualizes</i> a perceptual attributive if and only if (a) it makes essential use of the mode <br>
of presentation of a corresponding perceptual attributive; (b) it functions to indicate and <br>
attribute the same <i>representatum</i> (same attribute) that the perceptual at tribu tive does, and <br>
does so by depending only on the perceptual attributive; and (c) it, unlike the perceptual <br>
attributive, functions constitutively to contribute to a network of prop os ition al competen-<br>
cies, centrally competencies for propositional inference.<br>
<br>
The occurrences of conceptualizations that are, psychologically and no doubt evolu-<br>
tionarily, the most basic are those in <i>perceptual beliefs</i>. In the strict, narrow, technical sense <br>
of ‘<i>perceptual belief</i>’ that I use, all attributives in a perceptual belief are <i>conceptualizations</i> </div>
