less saturated and becomes more similar to the color of the background. Contrast sensitiv-<br>
ity is lessened. In daylight, the atmosphere operates as a veil. On clear days, without visible <br>
haze, the veil remains. These effects are caused by scattering of light by water vapor and <br>
other entities in the atmosphere.227<br>
<br>
I think it extremely implausible that all phenomena that cause these effects are <i>always <br>
representata</i> of perception. They are not always perceived, indicated, or attributed as such. <br>
The phenomena are registered by the visual system. They are among the cues for distance <br>
and ordinal depth. Astronauts on the moon report that objects seen in the distance appear <br>
much closer than they actually are.228 The illusion derives from absence of an atmospheric <br>
depth cue. Light distribution and perhaps illumination are cues to color. Atmospheric <br>
effects are obstacles to color constancy at great distances, and limits on lightness constan-<br>
cies. Yet they affect the mode of presentation for viewed objects and, consequently, percep-<br>
tual state kinds.<br>
<br>
Suppose that a visual system got the distance of an object right—by other cues besides <br>
the atmospheric depth cue. Suppose that the atmospheric effects are registered, but the <br>
cue is not utilized normally. The system represents the object as it would if there were no <br>
atmospheric effects. Suppose that the perception in fact occurs in the atmosphere. Is the <br>
perceptual state inaccurate given that it does not register the atmospheric effects or take <br>
them into account?229<br>
<br>
Similarly, suppose that a system got color-shade right, by other cues besides il lu min-<br>
ation. The system represents the shade as it would without the illumination that it in fact <br>
has. Is the perceptual state inaccurate, given that it does not take the illumination into <br>
account? Or if it represents illumination, and fails to take up some other light cue that is <br>
not represented, but that normally would affect a perception’s mode of presentation (per-<br>
haps thereby yielding a phenomenology that differs from the phenomenology that it <br>
would have if it did take that cue into account), is the perceptual state inaccurate?<br>
<br>
I think not. Using other cues to get distance and color right suffices to enable the per-<br>
ceiver to get right those things that the perceptual state functions (representationally) to <br>
respond to. The atmospheric effect is normally an obstacle to or interference with these <br>
functions. Normally the system circumvents the obstacle, filtering out the effect. Since, by <br>
hypothesis, the perceptual state does not normally represent the atmosphere, but only <br>
re gis ters it, it cannot fail representationally just by virtue of dropping the effects out of the <br>
perceptual process. Getting the color or distance right is not accidental. By hypothesis, it <br>
proceeds via a perceptual competence.<br>
<br>
Although haze is sometimes perceived, I doubt that anyone perceives the atmosphere that <br>
intervenes between viewer and object on a clear day or night, when there is no vis ible haze.<br>
<br>
It is unclear to me what to say about the apparent blueness of the mountains in the dis-<br>
tance, caused by atmospheric effects. Does the visual system attribute blue, though the <br>
mountains are grey, brown, or green? If so, color attributives applied to objects at such <br>
distances are systematically mistaken. Or perhaps perceptual systems go non-committal <br>
about color, at such distances. Perhaps the bluishness is a feature of the perspective, not <br>
presented as a color of the mountain. Perhaps visual systems are sensitive to such a fact.<br><br>
