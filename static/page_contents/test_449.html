Primitive Attribution of Mechanical Causation 449</div>

subjects know that they see 2-D displays in which the squares are just moving lights—and <br>
in which no real causation between the squares occurs—the impression of causation <br>
remains. He cited automatic production of the causal impression as evidence that repre-<br>
sentation of mechanical causation is innate and perceptual. He took the representation to <br>
be innate in the sense that it develops automatically and does not depend on the specifics <br>
of perceptual experience. He took it to be perceptual in the sense that it is the product of <br>
the visual system, operating in a specialized, automatic way, not essentially dependent on <br>
background memories or supplementary evidence.<br>
<br>
Work inspired by Michotte demonstrated that the causal impression is specific to <br>
certain spatio-temporal configurations, not to qualitative changes such as changes in <br>
color. The impression does not depend on frequency of occurrence, though, contrary <br>
to Michotte’s own views, features like size that are relevant to mechanical causation do <br>
matter. Subsequent work also discovered details of the basis for the causal impression. <br>
For example, effects of relative and absolute speeds, effects of various spatial or tem-<br>
poral gaps, effects of smoothness and continuity of motion, effects of duration and <br>
angles of motion, contextual effects, post-diction effects, effects of grouping and <br>
attention, and effects of interaction among sensory modalities have been studied in <br>
some detail.577<br>

6-month-olds’ reactions are similar to adults’. Various spatio-temporal configurations <br>
beyond those that underlie impressions of collisions have yielded similar impressions of <br>
mechanical causation. For example, spatio-temporal events that we naturally associate <br>
with pullings and with disintegration or bursting that are caused by collisions produce <br>
similar responses in adults and infants. Although there are individual differences in <br>
responses to exact spatio-temporal configurations, and although such differences can be <br><br>

example, some subjects’ causal impressions are more affected by observations of relative speed of two bodies than <br>
other subjects’. Some subjects are more exacting in requiring full spatial contiguity. Others are more exacting in <br>
requiring full temporal immediacy. There are individual differences that derive from training. See A. Schlottmann <br>

ings as out of keeping with either of Michotte’s hypotheses. Both hypotheses are compatible with individual <br>
adaptation, individual learning, individual physiological or psychological differences, individual differences in <br>
thresholds for applying a representation, and various attention effects. The results show enough similarity among <br>
individual responses that it is reasonable to postulate a core default capacity overlaid by performance effects, <br>
contextual effects, and effects from background knowledge.</div>
