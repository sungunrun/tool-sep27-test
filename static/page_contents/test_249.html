Accuracy Conditions for Tracking Particulars 249</div>
<br><br>
In natural scenes in which bodies move behind, and then out from, occlusions, tracking <br>
is fallible. Usually, there is some change in attributives that apply to features of a body dur-<br>
ing tracking. Attributives, except perhaps for temporal attributives, can remain the same <br>
during tracking—if an object remains still. In all these cases, tracking is fallible. In prin-<br>
ciple, the first-perceived object might be indiscernibly replaced by another. There is no <br>
question that, in these cases, the science counts two objects as perceived, as long the <br>
replacement is not so fast that it outruns minimum stimulus exposure or minimum pro-<br>
cessing time for an object perception to be formed—20–50 ms of exposure and not faster <br>
than 60–70 ms after stimulus onset. (See Chapters 10–11.)<br>
<br>
In contrast to (a΄-b΄), perceptual contents lack an identity attributive. Perceptual track-<br>
ing is not propositional. As in the (a΄-b΄) case, perceptual tracking does involve plural ref-<br>
erential applications. For the perceptual system is fallible about whether a later referential <br>
application picks out the particular that it began tracking. Certainly, first one object and <br>
then another can be seen. Different seen objects are referred to by different perceptual <br>
referential applications. Later applications function, fallibly, to pick out the initial particu-<br>
lar. In the laboratory case, with high speeds and impoverished cues, the subject is guess-<br>
ing. In normal cases, perceivers are very reliable in tracking. Still, tracking is fallible. In <br>
principle, it is always possible for a perceptual system to track a replacement as if it were <br>
the original.<br>
<br>
Referents of perceptual states are what are seen. Necessarily, the perceptual system’s <br>
operations could be caused and perceived first by one then by another particular that the <br>
system fails to discriminate from the first. So, when a system functions to track a particu-<br>
lar, it is fallible in exercises of this competence. Perceptual tracking is the non-propositional <br>
analog of (a΄-b΄).<br>
<br>
Different events <i>can</i> instantiate a single referential application, but only if a later event is <br>
anaphorically tied to the earlier one. There are some anaphoric ties from memory to per-<br>
ception. Then, there is no possibility that the referential events have different referents <br>
(though both may lack a referent), because the second reference depends <i>entirely</i> on the <br>
first. Such connection may occur within a perceptual state. But anaphoric connection does <br>
not normally, or perhaps ever, occur across different perceptual states. For it is known that <br>
what is seen depends on processing current stimuli of very short exposures, not on mem-<br>
ory of what has been recently seen. A perceptual state’s reference is not controlled com-<br>
pletely by an earlier perceptual state. (See Chapters 10–11.)234<br>

In perception, fallible tracking of particulars is committal. (See Chapter 6, the section <br>

<b>FOOTNOTES</b><br>
<b>Cont FN</b>234 Can there be fallible tracking of a particular within a single perceptual state? Yes. Of course, dealing with <br>
this issue in detail depends partly on how perceptual states are to be individuated. It is known that motion over <br>
very short time intervals—less than 60 ms—can be perceived. Such intervals are well within the bounds of suc-<br>
cessive saccades. Such durations are usually conceived as occurring <i>within</i> single perceptual states. Referential <br>
applications must differ if they apply to different perceived particulars in the actual world. For time spans that are <br>
too short to allow a perceptual state to process inputs from successive particulars, one can safely assume that <br>
referential application events that do not last longer than that span of time make up a single referential applica-<br>
tion. If the time span is long enough to allow change of referent—a different seen object—, then different prox-<br>
imal stimuli produce different referential applications. It is known that such time spans are very short. (See the <br>
discussion of Thorpe’s work and Potter’s work in Chapter 10 and Chapter 16.) Tracking motion across perceptual <br>
states—say, across saccades—does require a succession of referential applications. Then one could accommodate <br>
analogs of (a´-b´) in single perceptual states. We have a fallible but reliable capacity to apply a series of different <br>
referential applications to a single particular in tracking it, and in maintaining a memory file about it. Elaborating <br>
these points requires sensitivity to many theoretical considerations.</div>
