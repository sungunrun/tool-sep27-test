Constitutively, a sensory system is perceptual if and only if the system includes percep-<br>
tual constancies, hence objectification.46 In giving these necessary and sufficient condi-<br>
tions for a perceptual system, I do not define ‘perception’ or ‘perceptual system’. I provide a <br><br>

<b>FOOTNOTES</b><br>
<b>Cont FN</b>46 A. Morgan, ‘Mindless Accuracy: On the Ubiquity of Content in Nature’, <i>Synthese</i> 195 (2018), 1–27, objects <br>
to my view, not an uncommon view, that representation is a mark of mind. (See Chapter 1, the section <br>
Biological Function, Action, Sensing, and Perception—The Emergence of Mind.) He <br>
also objects to my view, just stated in the text, that a sensory system’s having perceptual constancies suffices for its <br>
being a perceptual system, hence for its having perceptual representation, hence for its marking mind. He urges <br>
two counter-examples. One urging is the claim that since modern cameras incorporate principles that amount to <br>
perceptual constancies for color, I am committed absurdly to their having minds. The other is that since botanists <br>
invoke accuracy in their explanations of circadian clocks in plants, botany is committed to plants’ having repre-<br>
sentations. Morgan concludes that, on my views, it should follow absurdly that plants have minds. Neither of <br>
these purported counter-examples is successful. Both depend on failure to read carefully what I have written.<br>
I stated that having perceptual constancies suffices for a <i>sensory system</i> to be a perceptual system. (See Burge, <br>
<i>Origins of Objectivity</i>, 413; Burge, ‘Perception: Where Mind Begins’; and this chapter, the section Perception <br>
as Objectification above). I explicitly tied being a sensory system to having a biological function. I also <br>
constitutively tied perception, hence perceptual constancy, to individual perceivers and to action. I claimed that, <br>
to have representational content, any perception, hence any perceptual constancy, must be associated with a <br>
capacity to use perception in action back on a subject matter. (Burge, <i>Origins of Objectivity</i>, 70n12, 292, 302, <br>
370–372; T. Burge, ‘Memory and Persons’, <i>The Philosophical Review</i> 112 (2003), 289–337, especially 296–299, <br>
reprinted in T. Burge, <i>Cognition Through Understanding: Self­ Knowledge, Interlocution, Reasoning, Reflection. <br>
Philosophical Essays</i>, Volume 3 (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2013), especially 414–417. See also this Chapter, <br>
the section Representation and Information Registration; Chapter 8, the section Is Temporal <br>
Representation Constitutive to Perceptual Representation?) Cameras lack bio logic al func-<br>
tions and do not act. So they do not have sensory systems in the sense that I set out. They are not relevant to the <br>
generalization I stated. Since cameras do not act, so their states lack representational content, and therefore per-<br>
ceptual constancies, though they have mechanisms that mimic perceptual constancies and function to produce <br>
states that we can take as derivatively, non-autonomously representational. Like desktop computers, they lack <br>
representational states except in a derivative sense. Their representational contents depend on action and use by <br>
individuals. I have long left it open whether perception might be correctly attributed to artifacts that have no <br>
biological function (though my generalization that Morgan mistakenly criticizes, was restricted to living sensory <br>
systems and perceptual systems). I have also long left it open whether robots <i>that can act</i> and that have appropri-<br>
ate analogs of perceptual and reasoning mechanisms could have perceptual and conceptual representation.<br>
Morgan’s second purported counter-example appeals to the fact that botanists talk of the accuracy of bio-<br>
logic al clocks, and embed such talk in ‘robust biological explanation’. He thinks that this talk shows that repre-<br>
sentation figures in biological explanation. So it is supposed to follow from my view that plants have minds. He <br>
also argues that my notion of perceptual constancy, hence perception, applies to plants.<br>
Morgan does not argue against my view that plants do not act. Like cameras, they cannot have perceptual <br>
constancies, because they cannot have representational content. He also does not argue against my view—<br>
because he seems to overlook it—that having representational capacities requires a capacity for action.<br>
It is true that there is talk of accuracy by botanists. This talk is probably legitimate under a loose colloquial <br>
notion of accuracy that equates it with, or allows it to include, biologically functional matching of states with a <br>
wider reality, here day–night rhythms in nature. (Morgan even says in an off-hand remark that accuracy “amounts <br>
to” such matching.) But in my work, I make a sharp distinction between this type of functional matching and the <br>
sort of accuracy that marks mind. A state’s being accurate, in my sense, entails nothing about biological advan-<br>
tages to an organism. A state’s realizing a biological function does. (See Burge, <i>Origins of Objectivity</i>, chapter 8; <br>
Burge, ‘Perception: Where Mind Begins’; and this Chapter, the section Representation and Information <br>
Registration.) I agree that “robust” explanation in botany appeals to functional matches between states of <br>
plants and day–night rhythms. That does not constitute causal explanation in terms of representational states, <br>
states that have accuracy conditions as an aspect of their natures. Causal explanations, not functional ex plan-<br>
ations, are the route to understanding the natures—the most basic explanatory kinds—of organisms’ states, at least <br>
the psychological states that I am discussing. I claim that the talk of accuracy in botany adds no essential explana-<br>
tory power to talk about realization of states’s biological function to correlate with circadian rhythms in nature.<br>
Morgan tries to show that the representational talk by botanists is distinct from talk about realizing biological <br>
function. The attempt fails because he makes the elementary mistake of interpreting talk about biological func-<br>
tion purely in terms of adaptive success in specific situations. He argues merely that “accurate” states in plants <br>
could in certain cases lead to dying. He nowhere even tries to argue that the talk about “accurate” states in plants <br>
does not stem from the basic notion of realizing a biological function—the notion of realizing a biological func-<br>
tion that I set out in <i>Origins of Objectivity</i> and in note 1 above: patterns of operation whose existence derives <br>
from their contributions to success in reproduction. The fact that a colloquially “accurate” state can in specific <br>
circumstances lead to death and be locally maladaptive, does not show that the colloquial accuracy does not <br>
amount to fulfilling a biological function. The dying plants still have the basic biological function of matching <br>
circadian rhythms.(<i>cont</i>.)</div>
