representational capacities cited in computational explanations do not constitutively func-<br>
tion to contribute to propositional structures. So the iconic structures in computations are <br>
not conceptual or propositional.<br>
<br>
The idea that the content of the <i>direct</i> input of visual attention commands (where there <br>
are commands) into the visual processing and visual states is <i>perceptual</i> content has some <br>
support beyond psychophysical models of perception—from neural studies. The frontal <br>
eye fields are a source of endogenous visual attention, hence attention initiations. They <br>
show patterns of neural correlation that closely match the neural patterns in the infero-<br>
temporal cortex (IT), caused by similar such patterns in V4. The neural patterns in IT <br>
underpin occurrent applications of perceptual categories.805 Similarly, neural effects in V4 <br>
of endogenous attention, in producing easier discriminability of objects by enhancing <br>
luminance contrast, are indistinguishable from the bottom-up impact of a stimulus <br>
increase in luminance contrast.806 V4 and IT are known to be prime areas underlying for-<br>
mation of visual attributives. Visual attention, in both its initiation and its effects, plausibly <br>
shares content and format of visual processing.<br>
<br>
These reflections support the second and third points at the end of the section Sources <br>
and Levels of Attention (this chapter). First, many non-human animals plausibly <br>
lack conceptual, propositional, or other supra-perceptual states, but direct their attention <br>
and shift their gaze in representationally explainable ways. Such cases are special cases of <br>
relatively primitive conation, discussed in Chapter 14. Second, even when propositional <br>
or other supra-perceptual-level states cause endogenous attention, they operate through <br>
perceptual-level attention commands and perceptual-level motor commands, including <br>
saccade commands. And they are not cited in computational explanations of initiations of <br>
endogenous perceptual attention. Perceptual-level states, such as perceptual memory, per-<br>
ceptual anticipation, and perceptual attention commands, suffice as representational <br>
 factors in the computational patterns, without involving whatever antecedent supra- <br>
perceptual-level causes they may have.<br>
<br>
These considerations support taking effects and initiations of visual attention to be <br>
internal to the visual system—certainly at the same representational level as visual percep-<br>
tion. They are not intrusions from some higher level. In what follows, I develop and apply <br>
this kind of point to other psychological powers that have been counted supra-perceptual <br>
or conceptual.<br><br>
