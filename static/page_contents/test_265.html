usually to make perception approximately veridical as regards timing, other things equal. <br>
Nearby events that occur just before the occurrence of the perception—because it takes <br>
time for light to travel and for a perception to form from proximal stimulation—are <br>
counted as within the present tense of a perceptual representation. Perception did not <br>
evolve to time changes in very distant perceived objects, such as the stars. I leave open <br>
how “present tensed” representations fare with respect to such objects. It is possible that <br>
error is common in such cases. However, as intimated earlier, I think that perceptual <br>
 systems are probably non-committal about timing and locating entities, if cues for spatial <br>
distance are impoverished—as they are for stars.<br>
<br>
The temporal framework of perception, but also that of perceptual memory and per-<br>
ceptual anticipation form the topic of this section.<br>
<br>
The intuitive point that perception is a <i>present</i> tensed masks considerable complexity.<br>
<br>
First, perception is not momentary. Any perceptual state occupies an interval of time. <br>
Second, timings occur <i>within</i> given perceptual states. The most obvious example of such <br>
timings occurs in perceptual representation of motion. It is intuitive, and widely assumed <br>
in the science, that a single perceptual state can represent movement from one place to <br>
another. In such cases, more than one time, and stage of temporally tracked movement, <br>
is represented by a single perceptual state. Third, multiple timings, relative to different <br>
types of entities perceived at different spatial positions, occur even within a given <br>
 perceptual state.<br>
<br>
There are analogs of these three points about perception in the tenses in language. First, <br>
present tense rarely designates a moment. Usually, it designates a temporal interval, <br>
roughly delimited by the language user’s understanding of context. Second, a temporal <br>
interval can be tracked within a single sentence, prototypically by progressive tense. Third, <br>
different temporal intervals can be marked as present within a single sentence: ‘Now it is <br>
beginning to move and continues to move as we speak.’<br>
<br>
As in discussion of spatial representational frameworks, I emphasize the distinction <br>
between information registration and perceptual representation. Many timing mech an-<br>
isms occur in organisms that do not <i>perceptually represent</i> anything. Accounting for these <br>
mechanisms does not require invoking states with veridicality conditions. Circadian <br>
rhythms in the molecular structure of plants are systematically isomorphic to time and <br>
function to regulate growth, flowering, and photo-synthesis.255 Such temporal informa-<br>
tion registration is not perception and is not associated with perceptual constancy, or <br>
states with veridicality conditions. Functional timing in the living world underlies, but is <br>
not the same as, temporal representation.<br>
<br>
A richer example of pre-representational timing is registration of optic flow in control-<br>
ling the flight of bees. Such timing does not time perceived events. The timing is confined <br>
to changes in the sensory registration of light arrays on the bee’s retina, with no computa-<br>
tions of specific changes in 3-D space. Of course, these changes correlate with such <br>
changes and function to do so. However, science’s causal explanation of the bee’s sensory <br>
temporal competence, for many tasks, is centered entirely on changes in the bee’s sensory <br>
registration, with no need to postulate perception of entities in the environment.256 The <br><br>
