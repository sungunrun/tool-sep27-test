234 Attributives, Referential Applications in Constancies</div>

approximately accurately represents a straight edge and the positions of its endpoints in <br>
3-D space must be capable of treating the edge’s endpoints (or those of another edge of <br>
similar length) as marking a given distance—hence an edge length—, even if the edge <br>
were to occur in different orientations or distances with respect to the viewer. Plotting <br>
endpoints, as they occur in different spatial relations to the viewer, would yield the same <br>
distance under different stimulus conditions. Perceptual constancy would be evinced in <br>
action and perceptual anticipation. Similar points apply to attributives for shape and <br>
orientation.<br>
<br>
Suppose that we drop the assumption that the edge is straight. Then determining edge <br>
length by plotting will be more difficult. Exercises of constancies are mostly approxima-<br>
tions to sameness of attribute. Despite changes in orientation or distance of an edge-shape, <br>
a visual system yields approximately accurate estimates of lengths and shapes in favorable <br>
contexts. Most edges in nature are not straight. Yet length constancy—the <i>capability</i> of <br>
getting length right under significantly different stimulations—remains a remarkable <br>
capacity for many visual systems.<br>
<br>
The fact that plotting an edge via locating its course in a spatial coordinate system con-<br>
stitutes a perceptual unit that enables determination of edge length is important. Since the <br>
position of every perceptually discriminable part of an unoccluded, nearby edge is plotted, <br>
the distance between any two perceivable segments of the line—including neighboring, <br>
finest-discriminable segments—can be plotted. The system has perceptual attributives for <br>
the length of any given part, since attributives are perceptual capacities to indicate and <br>
attribute. The system does not apply length attributives to the distance between any two <br>
arbitrarily chosen positions of the edge, although it has the attributives to make such an <br>
application. Information for determining such segment lengths is present in the system. <br>
A computation for an applied perceptual length attributive normally requires the edge <br>
endpoints to be perceived or perceptually anticipated. It is not the case that the endpoints <br>
of all segments of an edge are individually perceptually represented.<br>
<br>
All such lengths and segments are perceptually <i>determinable</i>, at least down to some <br>
smallest level of grain—if distance, occlusion, or blur does not force indeterminacies. If <br>
the perceiver were to attend to two positions on the line, the pereceiver’s system might <br>
indicate a length between the positions. Apart from such attention or other demarcation, <br>
the system computes only the whole edge via natural stimulus demarcation of its end-<br>
points, and thereby computes attendant attributes like length, shape, and orientation. <br>
Arbitrary segments of the edge are perceived by perceiving the edge. They are included in <br>
plotting the edge. They are therefore perceived as edge-parts. They are not represented as <br>
units unless their endpoints are determined.<br>
<br>
Similar points apply to shape. In representing a surface’s shape, the system plots the <br>
surface, bounded by its edges, in its egocentric coordinate system. The positions of all <br>
perceptually discriminable parts of the surface are plotted, inasmuch as the position of the <br>
surface, oriented in 3-D space, is plotted. (Again, here as always, one must allow for the <br>
prevalence of ordinal depth representation that produces indeterminate 3-D volume shape <br>
representations.) Arbitrary shapes of sub-parts of the surface—say, an unmarked circular <br>
region, inside the surface’s boundaries—are not automatically individually represented as <br>
such. The information for representing them is contained in the perceptual representation <br>
of the whole surface. All parts of the circular region are perceived as surface-parts. The <br>
circle corresponds to no perceptual unit. Its boundaries are not perceptually delineated. </div>
