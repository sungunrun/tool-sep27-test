558 Perceptual Attention</div>
<br><br>
Propositional versions of all these functions occur in humans. One can change one’s <br>
plans and intentions, elaborate one’s plans, attend to one’s reasoning in deciding on a tar-<br>
get, and anticipate and inhibit distractors. However, even in humans, the executive control <br>
system operates at both perceptual and propositional levels. I will explain that even when <br>
that system initiates an active, controlled saccade motivated by a propositionally formu-<br>
lated plan, the system operates at both levels. <i>In itself</i>, even in humans, it does not operate <br>
exclusively at the propositional level. Inasmuch as it initiates endogenous visual percep-<br>
tual attention through perceptual-level attention commands, and regulates relatively <br>
primitive motor commands, it operates at the representational level of perception and <br>
rela tive ly primitive conation. These operations of the executive control system are part of <br>
the visuomotor system. In fact, <i>much of what is known</i> about the executive control system <br>
centers on those of its operations that are part of the visuomotor system.<br>
<br>
This point can be made more vivid by considering a typical computational account of <br>
the role of the executive control system in allocating attention in the interests of action—<br>
an account by John Tsotsos and Wouter Kruijne. The system is an update of Ullman’s visual <br>
routines, meant to allow for priming and feedback both before and within perceptual pro-<br>
cessing.797 The authors call the operations ‘cognitive’ and freely appeal to “knowledge”, <br>
“reason ing”, “concepts”, and “recognition”. But to understand the account, one must scru-<br>
tin ize how these terms are actually used, and what sorts of psychological phenomena they <br>
are applied to. As I indicated in Chapter 13 and will discuss further in Chapter 19, usage of <br>
these terms in the scientific literature is varied and often unreflective. The authors’ term <br>
‘cognitive’ applies to perceptual-level phenomena, including more advanced aspects of <br>
perception and perceptual-level conation. ‘Knowledge’ applies to memory, specifically <br>
working memory and long-term memory, with no hint of appeal to propositional cap aci-<br>
ties stored in memory. As I argue in Chapters 16–17, both these types of memory store <br>
non-propositional visual perceptual images and have perceptual-level functions. The <br>
authors’ term ‘reasoning’ applies to any transition in the perceptual system. ‘Concepts’ <br>
applies to perceptual attributives. ‘Recognition’ applies to perceptual categorization in <br>
which one perceptual categorization is distinguished from another. The <i>uses</i> of all these <br>
terms in the account apply purely to perceptual-level phenomena.<br>
<br>
Let us consider in detail the operations and representations (or representational con-<br>
tents) that are appealed to in the computational account, checking whether they are <br>
perceptual-level in the sense of this term that I have explained. From the beginning, the <br>
authors tout the program’s openness to ‘testable implementation that uses real images’. The <br>
representations manipulated in the program are iconic images. Since there is no appeal to <br>
propositional use of these images, the images have the form of perceptual contents: percep-<br>
tual attributives governed by context-dependent determiners. The authors take their guid-<br>
ing question to be ‘What are the computational tasks that an executive controller for visual <br>
attention must solve?’. They see their approach as ‘centered on visual representations <br>
im port ant for the completion of perceptual tasks, and transformations between representa-<br>
tions that traverse the path from task specification to stimulus presentation to task <br>
 completion’. Task specifications are what I called, in Chapter 14, conative representations of <br>
targets. They affect processing (say, via priming) both before a perceptual stimulus and dur-<br>
ing perceptual processing. They are stored in perceptual-level conative memory. See Figures <br><br>
