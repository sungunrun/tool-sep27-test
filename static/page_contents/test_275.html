The foregoing example should convey a sense for how some of the factors in timing <br>
show up in the representational contents of perceptual states. Different timing mech an-<br>
isms for different aspects of a perception can be associated with different “nows” and <br>
might be subject to different distorting factors. The example should also hint at the extra <br>
complexity introduced by temporal representation in perception, and the supreme <br>
im port ance of iconic representation in making possible a manageable perceptual repre-<br>
sentation of motion and other change.<br><br>

<b>Is Temporal Representation Constitutive to Perceptual Representation?<br><br>
</div>
</b>In <i>Origins of Objectivity</i> I argued that representation of time is constitutive to perceptual <br>
representation. I think that perception in all actual animals includes a competence to <br>
attribute temporal relations, which I take to include analogs of present-tense applications. <br>
What interested me were two more general philosophical questions: Is it constitutively <br>
necessary to perception that it contain temporal representation? If so, is that point <br>
 knowable apriori? I answered both questions affirmatively. I have never taken these <br>
answers or my arguments for them to be obvious. It seemed to me, however, worth devel-<br>
oping them, in the interests of deeper understanding. Here I revisit and, I think, improve <br>
the arguments.274<br>
<br>
It is empirically clear that many organisms register time without having perception. <br>
Nature’s temporal rhythms and orders are encoded in very simple organisms. The encod-<br>
ings affect behavior. It is worth understanding how these registrations get co-opted by <br>
perception and made representational. Of course, temporal intervals are never perceived. <br>
They are attributed.<br>
<br>
Perception is broadly a “present” sense. It would be easy to think that it <i>therefore</i> is pre-<br>
sent tensed, or that it represents time.275 I think that there is something to the inference, <br>
but I doubt that it should persuade by itself. It would seem that to take an individual as <br>
representing a time <i>as</i> present, there must be some contrast value to the representation. If <br>
present-time representation does not contrast with some other type of time representation—<br>
say, representation of past or future times, or times before or after one another within a <br>
present—one might think that there is no real use in the system for time representation <br>
at all. I do not endorse this objection, but I think it should give one pause. I argued that <br><br>

<b>Cont FN</b>273 Retaining ‘(i)’ and ‘(c)’ as <i>sub</i>scripts on the symbols for the attributives for <i>brown</i> and <i>cubical</i> may not be <br>
necessary. As <i>super</i>scripts, they mark the constitutive nature of the different attributives. As subscripts, they <br>
mark a type of attribution. If these cross-attribute attributions are relational (here, to a time), one will not need <br>
both subscript and superscript to distinguish cases. Still, they mark a conceptual distinction in understanding <br>
the representational form and content.<br>

275 How to represent tense in language is disputed. I think that tense in language is best taken to involve refer-<br>
ence to times. Others propose “operator” analyses that do not refer to, or quantify over, times. It is, of course, <br>
possible, but I think unlikely, that language goes one way and perception, another. The representation-of-times <br>
view parallels representation of places, which is plausibly common in spatial frameworks. For those devoted to <br>
operators, the points here can be transposed.</div>
