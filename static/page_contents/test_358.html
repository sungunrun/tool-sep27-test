358 The Iconic Nature of Perception</div>
<br><br>
Because edges are natural perceptual units and have part–whole relations, their iconic <br>
representation induces a part–whole structure analogous to that of surfaces. Since edges <br>
are iconically represented in space, the spatial relational attributives of spatial direction, <br>
orientation, and depth induce a spatial structure for edges that is analogous to that of <br>
surfaces.<br>
<br>
From edges, I leap to 3-D aspects of vision. The 2-D matrix whose representational <br>
components pick out positions of <i>Big Surface</i> was an idealization. It ignores in de ter min-<br>
acies and differences between foveal and peripheral vision. It ignores motion. It abstracts <br>
from most of the 3-D representational content of vision. Two considerations motivated <br>
isolating an iconic 2-D representational matrix, and its relation to a <i>Big Surface,</i> as an <br>
important factor in vision.<br>
<br>
One derives from the close relation between (a) the 2-D matrix of receptors for register-<br>
ing the retinal image, together with further 2-D matrices that register more abstract <br>
aspects of the retinal image, and (b) the way the format of visual representation utilizes <br>
those registrations in analogous matrices for representing entities in 3-D space. The pre-<br>
representational 2-D matrices give way to 2-D matrices with 3-D significance as the per-<br>
ceptual constancies emerge. The basic format of all visual spatial representations owes <br>
much to the initial layout of the effects of light on the retina. This layout has a natural <br>
analog in the format of visual representational content.<br>
<br>
The other motivation derives from how visual representation presents facing surfaces of <br>
entities in 3-D space: the surfaces constitute a non-planar surface, and <i>everything that is <br>
perceived is perceived by way of perceiving surfaces that make up that non-planar surface</i>. <br>
This is the fundamental fact that determines visual perceptual perspective.<br>
<br>
Pictures and photographs recreate some of the spatial perspective of visual representa-<br>
tion. A difference between vision and pictures that gives vision further 3-D cues is that we <br>
do not look at visual input. We just use it. In looking <i>at</i> pictures, at least from a normal <br>
viewing distance, we have many fewer cues that yield anticipation of perceiving new <br>
 surfaces if we or they move.374<br>
<br>
The representational content of both 3-D volume shape and body attributives is what it <br>
is partly because it is associated with perceptual anticipations—anticipations of how the <br>
environment would look if the angle of visual perception were changed. If one perceives <br>
something as a cube by perceiving only its facing surface straight-on, one perceptually <br>
anticipates an edge between the originally facing surface and a surface sharply receding in <br>
depth if one were to move somewhat to the left while looking at the cube. The com bin-<br>
ation of the actual presentation of the surface, together with the anticipated perceptual <br>
representation, constitutes a normal element in a visual system’s representing the surface <br>
both as the surface of a 3-D volume shape and as a body. Whenever an individual sees a <br>
3-D volume shape from a perspective, the individual harbors a range of anticipations that <br>
if arranged dynamically would yield something like a 3-D image, <i>modulo</i> indeterminacies <br>
in the system’s commitment to the specific shapes of unseen surfaces.<br><br>

<b>Cont FN</b>374 Of course, we can get new angles on picture surfaces. Sometimes textural effects from paint’s having been <br>
laid on at various depths allow different perspectives. All paintings look somewhat different from different <br>
angles. Some paintings, famously Holbein’s <i>Ambassadors</i>, use such angles for dramatic effects. But the scope for <br>
seeing more by moving is much smaller, given that paintings are (usually) basically surfaces, not 3-D objects in <br>
the round.</div>
