Representation and Veridicality Conditions 29</div>

embedded in a competence for propositional inference, or that all non-propositional states <br>
other than perceptual states constitutively depend either on perceptual constancies or on a <br>
competence for propositional inference. I save these points for another occasion.<br>
<br>
I return to the condition on being a representational state—having a veridicality condi-<br>
tion as an aspect of the state’s nature. <i>Veridicality</i> is the genus of which truth and accuracy <br>
are species. <i>Truth</i> is propositional veridicality. A belief is propositional in that its represen-<br>
tational structure has the form of a proposition. A <i>proposition</i> has the same structure as a <br>
declarative sentence, though a proposition need not be linguistic at all. <i>Accuracy</i> is non-<br>
propositional veridicality. A map, a realist drawing, a realist painting, and a perception are <br>
not propositional. Each lacks the representational structure of a declarative sentence. Yet <br>
each can be accurate or inaccurate.<br>
<br>
The basic ideas in the technical-sounding explication of ‘representational’ are straightfor-<br>
ward. What is a <i>veridicality condition</i>? A veridicality condition is a condition that when <br>
met is veridical—true or accurate—and when not met is non-veridical. A veridicality con-<br>
dition for a belief that elephants are threatened by poachers is simply the condition ele-<br>
phants are threatened by poachers. If the world meets that condition—if elephants are in <br>
fact threatened by poachers—, the condition is met. This particular condition is true. If <br>
the world does not meet the condition, the condition is not met.<br>
<br>
A veridicality condition for a perceptual state that represents some particular body as <br>
being cubical is the condition that1 cubical body. If the perceiver or perceptual state does <br>
perceptually single out a cubical body in the environment, the condition is accurate. If <br>
nothing is perceived, or if what is perceived is not a body or is not cubical, then the stand-<br>
ard for being accurate that is set by the perceptual state is not met, and its veridicality <br>
condition is inaccurate.<br>
<br>
Not only veridicality conditions, but psychological states that have them, can be veridi-<br>
cal or non-veridical. Not only the veridicality condition elephants are threatened by <br>
poachers, but a belief with that veridicality condition, is true, if the veridicality condition <br>
is matched by the world.<br>
<br>
The phrase ‘as an aspect of its nature’ in the explication of a state’s being representa-<br>
tional requires that the state’s having the veridicality condition is not a matter of a mere <br>
stance or attitude on the part of some commentator. Some, even some scientists in meta-<br>
patter, take trees to see, because of their sensitivity to light. They can add that trees’ states <br>
have veridicality conditions. Such a view is, I think, romantic, not serious science. A sign <br>
that veridicality conditions are an aspect of a state’s nature is that a science makes system-<br>
atic reference to veridicality conditions in its basic causal explanations. Since perceptual <br>
psychology does so, there is good reason to take veridicality conditions to be aspects of the <br>
states’ natures, not just ornaments in a popularization of science, that itself does not iden-<br>
tify psychological notions in causal scientific explanation.<br>
<br>
Being an aspect of a state’s nature is not merely being a real property of the state. It is <br>
being a constitutive or essential property. States that are representational are, I think, con-<br>
stitutively so. If they are representational, the veridicality condition of the state is an aspect <br>
of what the state fundamentally <i>is</i>. A state could not be the state that it is and lack the <br>
veridicality condition that it has. In saying this, I do not care to push a heavy-duty <br>
 metaphysics. What is important is that the science has no more fundamental way of <br>
 identifying the state-kind, for purposes of its most serious explanations. In psychology a <br>
veridicality condition is a central individuating feature of the state. This point shows up in </div>
