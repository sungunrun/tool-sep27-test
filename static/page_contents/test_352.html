positions. Highlights are perceived as at the same place as or closer than the things that <br>
they occlude, probably not precisely located.<br>
<br>
The iconic spatial mapping is set by lines of sight. These lines follow the path of light <br>
from positions of surfaces in the environment to locations in the retina, thence to loca-<br>
tions in the cortex, and eventually to semantically relevant parts of the representational <br>
content that represents entities in a map-like way. Each smallest part of the map-like per-<br>
ceptual representational content that applies to something perceptually discernible, with <br>
qualifications already mentioned, functions to map 1–1-into an occupied part of a non-<br>
planar surface in 3 dimensions.<br>
<br>
The mapping lines are never entirely defined by their direction. Most purely directional <br>
mapping is sub-perceptual—merely sensory registrational. In primitive non-perceptual <br>
systems, direction of the proximal stimulus is mapped without depth. In normal percep-<br>
tion, the formation of genuinely spatial representation does not occur until directional <br>
registrations are provided with 3-D significance. Reasons for this point are discussed in <br>
Chapter 3, the section Retinal Image Contour Registration and Surface <br>
Contour Perception. The mapping lines normally correspond to a determinate dis-<br>
tance, again with constrained allowance for some indeterminacies.<br>
<br>
Each minimal cell in an iconic representational array functions to represent one or <br>
more (usually more) particulars—instances of attributes—that occupy the corresponding <br>
position or depth in 3-D space that the mapping lines end at—with indeterminacies for <br>
cases like the sky and highlights. One perceives every perceptually discernible part of <br>
every surface that one perceives. See Figure 9.3.<br>
<br>
The facing surfaces of the occupants of space that reflect light and that are perceived are <br>
surfaces and parts of surfaces of bodies, gases, highlights, and backgrounds. These facing <br>
surfaces occupy a non-planar surface in 3 dimensions that constitutes <i>Big Surface</i>.<br>
<br>
Again, this surface is <i>not</i> represented as a unit by perception. Perceptual units involve, <br>
for example, the facing surface of a giraffe-body, the facing surface of that part of a back-<br>
ground tree that is not occluded by the giraffe, the full but partly occluded surface of the <br>
background tree, and so on. Although these surfaces are at different depths, and are repre-<br>
sented by different perceptual units, they, or parts of them, are mapped into by adjacent <br>
aspects of the pixel-like representational array. They count as adjacent parts of the 2-D <br>
mapped (though not represented) <i>Big Surface</i>. So adjacent positions in <i>Big Surface</i> are <br>
often at substantially different depths from the perceiver, because adjacent lines of sight <br>
map to them.<br>
<br>
There is no material connection between the giraffe’s surface and the partly occluded, <br>
visible tree-trunk-surface behind it. So the giraffe’s surface is not part of a larger <i>connected</i> <br>
surface in physical space. Adjacent positions in <i>Big Surface</i> do not vary smoothly in dis-<br>
tances from one another or from the perceiver. So, <i>Big Surface</i> usually does not constitute <br>
a plane. Just as, every visually discriminated position in a realist painting functions to map <br>
into some discriminated spatial part of a surface or background in the painted scene, so <br>
every spatially relevant part of a perceptual representational-content map-matrix func-<br>
tions to map into some position in space occupied by a perceived entity. Perceived entities <br>
include smallest perceived parts of natural-unit entities, allowing again for special-case <br>
indeterminacies.<br>
<br>
In sketching this model, I capitalize on part–whole structure in the representational <br>
content. Structural parts of the representational content map into parts of <i>Big Surface</i> <br>
occupied by smallest perceptually discernible entities. The positions of every combination </div>
