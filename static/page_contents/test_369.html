Three Limitative Views of First-Formed Perception 369</div>

them to be such. It is likely, however, that perceptual systems lack attributives specifically <br>
for baseball bats or x-ray machines. We perceive them, but do not perceive them as such. <br>
We perceive the physical bodies via their shapes and motions, and we auto mat ic al ly and <br>
naturally connect those perceptions to our concepts for baseball bats and x-ray machines.<br>
<br>
The views that I am concerned with are more sophisticated than appeals to ordinary <br>
talk about perceiving or seeing. They are based on serious psychological theorizing. <br>
Nevertheless, although they garnered a lot of attention even among scientists, they are, in <br>
the main, mistaken. They have come to be rejected in perceptual psychology.<br>
<br>
The lines of thought that I discuss are, of course, not mistaken in postulating perceptual <br>
processes that include interactions with attention shifts and memory. They are not mis-<br>
taken in claiming that perceptions interact with conceptual states in various ways. They <br>
are mistaken in denying that representations of certain familiar macro-features of the <br>
physical environment occur in first-formed perception, and in claiming that applications <br>
of attention, attention shifts, or occurrent input from memory, or concepts, are <i>required</i> if <br>
any of these familiar macro-features are to be represented. They are mistaken in postulat-<br>
ing a necessary and direct a role for attention, memory, or concepts in the initial formation <br>
of relevant perceptual attributions.<br>
<br>
Three lines of thought in perceptual psychology contributed to the view that first-formed <br>
perception represents very little about central relations, properties, and kinds in the en vir-<br>
on ment, and requires the supplements just mentioned, if it is to represent such matters.<br>
<br>
The first line of thought derives from David Marr. It was common in the best work in <br>
psychophysics, two to three decades ago. The line was that the initial processing in percep-<br>
tion <i>per se</i> is extremely limited. In his important and influential book <i>Vision</i>, Marr postu-<br>
lated a 2½-D sketch. Marr thought that the 2½-D sketch was the end of perceptual <br>
processing that did not, by computational law, depend on higher-level “cognitive” or “con-<br>
ceptual” input. Subsequently Shimon Ullman maintained that prior to application of shifts <br>
of attention, perceptual processing gets only as far as a 2½-D sketch.382 A 2½-D sketch was <br>
supposed to represent only surfaces oriented in 3-D space. It was supposed to locate sur-<br>
faces purely in relation to the viewer and not in relation to one another. Thus at this stage, <br>
even computations of spatial relations between a surface and its background were sup-<br>
posed not to have been produced.<br>
<br>
On this view, prior to attention shifts, perception yields only very limited perceptual speci-<br>
fication of environmental features. Ullman maintained that representation of objects as being <br>
in even simple spatial relations between one another requires visual routines that involve <br>
shifts of attention on a visually maintained or visually remembered perception. Only through <br>
visual routines are 3-D volume shapes, not to mention bodies, supposed to be perceived as <br>
such. This view seems to have rested primarily on informed judgments about how visual <br>
computations <i>might</i> proceed, not on extensive experimentation. Some of the experimental <br>
work by Treisman—to be discussed below—, however, may have influenced Ullman’s view.<br>
<br>
A second line of thought stemmed from experiments that indicate that human ob ser vers <br>
find change detection difficult in certain contexts. This line rested on a wide array of evidence.<br>
<br>
Over forty years ago, relevant experiments focused on motion of a viewed scene during <br>
saccades. When local transient motion signals that are normally produced by a change are <br>
not available to perception because the change occurs during a saccade, sensitivity to motion <br><br>
