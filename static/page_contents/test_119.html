surface of the entity; and one must probably see the surface as a surface and some of the <br>
surface’s boundary contours as edge contours.<br>
<br>
It used to be thought that 3-D volume shapes had to be <i>constructed</i>, in forming percep-<br>
tual states from sensory input, out of representations for surfaces and edges.123 This view is <br>
too simple. 3-D perceptual information can affect perception of surfaces and contours. So <br>
the dependence of 3-D perception on perception as of surfaces oriented in 3-D space is <br>
not one-way.<br>
<br>
Still, perceptual attribution of 3-D volume shape seems not to be independent of attri-<br>
bution of surfaces and contours. Perceptual representation as of a 3-D volume shape <br>
involves representing specific, perceptually discernible aspects or parts of the shape—<br>
specifically, some of its surface regions and boundaries.<br>
<br>
It may be that there are no surfaces in nature except surfaces of 3-D entities. However, <br>
some perceptual systems, or some stages of processing in some perceptual systems, might <br>
represent surfaces as surfaces, oriented at various slants in 3-D space, but lack attribu-<br>
tives for 3-D volume shapes or other 3-D entities. These matters must be determined <br>
empirically.<br>
<br>
Perceptual shape attributives are representationally prior, in some ways, to many other <br>
ranges of attributives. I conjecture that one cannot visually (or haptically or propriocep-<br>
tively) perceive something as a body except by perceiving it as having a closed outer <br>
boundary.124 Perceptual representation as of body brings with it anticipational disposi-<br>
tions, such as anticipation of retention of generic shape. The central cue for visually attrib-<br>
uting the kind <i>body</i> is perceptual attribution of closed shape.<br>
<br>
Analogous points for perceptual representational dependence hierarchies apply to <br>
functional attributives. It is not firmly established that functional attributives, like danger-<br>
ous, edible, shelter, caretaker occur in some visual perceptual systems. I think it likely <br>
that they do and provisionally assume so. If they do not, they certainly occur in actional <br>
representational systems that are broadly at the same representational level as perceptual <br>
systems. Visual attribution of functional properties representationally depends on attribu-<br>
tion of shape, size, and motion—and, for more complex systems, body. One cannot see <br>
something as food without except by seeing it as having a certain shape, size, and/or <br>
motion. I think that this claim is probably apriori. There is certainly no mainstream <br>
 theorist of perception-formation who would now disagree.<br>
<br>
The ultra-fast speed of basic functional categorizations suggests that they can result <br>
from one-pass-through processing in the visual systems of humans and other mammals. <br>
Apes and humans can visually categorize something as food in less than 100 ms.125 Such <br>
categorizations occur only through a processing hierarchy that uses spatial and other <br>
attributives.<br><br>

124 I assume that the relevant perceptual system has shape representations. I doubt that any perceptual system, <br>
in any sensory modality, that lacks shape representation could perceptually represent something as a body. I do <br>
not deny that in particular cases, a visual system could perhaps “bet” on a body purely on the basis of a type of <br>
motion too poorly seen to allow representation of an outer boundary. Nothing here hinges on these matters.<br>

that shape is more basic than color in producing super-ordinate categorization for categories like <i>edible body</i> and <br>
<i>animal-body</i>. Categorization of superordinate categories is often faster than categorization for “basic” categories, <br>
like <i>banana</i>-<i>body</i>, <i>cat-body</i>, or <i>car-body</i>. See Chapters 10–11.</div>
