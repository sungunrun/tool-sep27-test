314 The Iconic Nature of Perception</div>

il lu min ation in color constancies. In certain conditions, there is a relatively direct map-<br>
ping, but often not. The representational mapping has further parameters besides a direct <br>
intensity mapping. The structural mapping needed for iconicity need not be a simple mat-<br>
ter of direct proportion between environmental and representational intensities. There do <br>
seem to remain natural mappings.332<br>
<br>
A third type of non-representational mapping relation that enters into the iconicity of <br>
perception is representation of attributes in <i>packages</i>. An edge attributive comes with <br>
attributives for the edge’s shape, length (whether as a magnitude or as a ordinal property), <br>
and orientation. Perceptual representation tends to combine attributives. Here structural <br>
elements in condition (1) of our characterization of iconic representation are the co-<br>
occurrences in nature of a number of attributes and co-occurrences in perception of cor-<br>
responding types of attributives. Co-occurrence of perceptual representations, often <br>
tagged to a single location, maps 1–1 into the co-occurrences in nature. The structural <br>
relation of co-occurrence is preserved in the mapping, meeting condition (2). The co-<br>
occurrence is used in perceptual representation, meeting condition (3).<br>
<br>
A surface, its size, shape, color, and its being the surface of a body, with <i>its</i> size, shape, <br>
and color are tagged to a location, or at least an ordinal depth in a given direction, and <br>
represented together. These attributes co-occur in nature.<br>
<br>
Linguistic representations of these properties can easily be separated. In a linguistic <br>
representation only one property can be represented. We can speak of a surface’s size with-<br>
out speaking of its shape. In visual perception, except in special cases, the properties are <br>
represented in packages. Packaging in nature is matched by packaging in representation.<br>
<br>
Similarly, in linguistically describing what one hears, one can choose to select only one <br>
or two attributes: I heard a sound, or I heard a sound at the pitch of middle C. In auditory <br>
perception one normally hears a sound at a pitch, with a given duration, loudness, and <br>
timbre—and in a rough location, for example, at substantial distance coming from the left.<br><br>

<b>Iconic Visual Perception and Maps or Pictures<br><br>
</div>
</b>A common iconic way to model perceptual representation is to arrange a set of discrete, <br>
digitized color values in a digital matrix. The color values represent the colors on surfaces <br>
or backgrounds, and the positions in the matrix correspond to positions in space. Such a <br>
representation would have a part–whole structure that maps into a part–whole structure <br>
of its represented subject matter. Because perception can make only finitely many dis-<br>
criminations on any spectrum or dimension, it plausible that perception is, at the finest <br>
grain of analysis, digital.<br>
<br>
Emphatically, one does not perceive perceptual representations. Here is a disanalogy <br>
with photographs or realist paintings. There are many other differences between percep-<br>
tual states, on one hand, and photographs or pictures, on the other. The point of compari-<br>
son is to indicate a broad similarity in representational format-structure.<br><br>
