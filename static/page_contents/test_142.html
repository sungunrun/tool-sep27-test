142 PercePtual reference requires PercePtual attribution</div>
<br><br>
cannot perceive causes of a perceived distal stimulus that are “masked” by that stimulus. <br>
For example, suppose that a technician creates a perceived red cubical body by showing <br>
(out of sight of the perceiver on the other side of the machine) a red cubical body to a <br>
machine. The machine then copies the body and spits out the copy, making it available for <br>
perception. The first body figures in the occurrent causal chain that causes the perceived <br>
second body. But the first body is not perceived, and the perceiver’s perceptual attributives <br>
for <i>red</i>, <i>cubical</i>, and <i>body</i> are not applied to it. Visual attributives are capacities to charac-<br>
terize, in response to light that affects the system’s sensors. No light from the first body <br>
makes it to the system’s sensors. Application of the attributives is sensitive to the specific <br>
nature of causal chains, not to just any factor in the causal chain.<br>
<br>
What of particulars in the causal chain between the purportedly perceived distal stimu-<br>
lus and the proximal stimulus? Again, visual perceivers normally cannot perceive arrays of <br>
light between a surface off which they reflect and the proximal stimulus. So their charac-<br>
terizing competencies—do not apply to such arrays, or to attributes of such arrays. The <br>
discriminative characterizational capacities are specifically perceptual. Applications of <br>
them cannot apply veridically to what the perceiver lacks a competence to perceive.<br>
<br>
This point will gain depth and resonance as the notion of perceptual attributive is devel-<br>
oped in Chapters 6 and 7. It can be stated here, however, that perceptual attributives are <br>
always more specific than might be suggested by linguistic renderings of them. For <br>
ex ample, the property <i>red</i> is attributed as it is presented in specific lighting conditions. The <br>
property <i>cubical</i> is characterized by an attributive molded by the specific orientation on <br>
the purported cube—from above or with a corner head-on, for example. These capacities <br>
make use of the proximal stimulus to isolate specific aspects of the way a distal property is <br>
presented. The probability that there are multiple particulars in the causal that meet the <br>
specification provided by a perceptual attributive is vanishingly small or nil. If there are <br>
multiple ones, the application applies to the first one back in the chain beyond the prox-<br>
imal stimulus. Alternatively perhaps, there is sometimes a failure of reference, because no <br>
one particular is picked out. I believe the multiple application issue is not a serious one. So <br>
I leave ways of responding to it to this degree open.<br>
<br>
Step 12. articulates a point that most thinkers find obvious. Individuals lack a compe-<br>
tence to pick out a particular neat—without characterizing it in any way. One can use <br>
unmodified ‘that’ in speech, but the occurrence of ‘that’ has unarticulated characteriza-<br>
tional help.<br>
<br>
There is a principle closely related to (AA1) that is worth remarking on. A function of a <br>
perceptual competence is broadly discriminatory. A perceptual competence not only <br>
functions to discriminate a perceived particular from other particulars in the occurrent <br>
causal chain that issues in a perceptual-state-instance. It also functions to discriminate <br>
different particulars that it functions to pick out at the same time. Always, or nearly always, <br>
a perceptual-state-instance functions to pick out more than one particular. Even an occur-<br>
rence of a very simple perceptual state that represents an instance of the color blue as blue <br>
is likely to represent parts of the color-instance as well as the whole instance (or patch). <br>
(See Chapter 9, the section Part–Whole RePresentation in Pictures and <br>
Visual PercePtion.) To do so there must be repeatable competencies to distinguish <br>
the different particulars. I think that such competencies are always exercised when a per-<br>
ceptual state functions to pick out more than one particular. The principle closely related <br>
to (AA1) is:</div>
