Structure of Conation in Relatively Primitive Action 523</div>
<br><br>
Anticipations generated from efference copy are integrated with the perceptual records <br>
of the target-object and the body effector (say, the hand), to represent the state of the body <br>
effector and the target-object that the next motor command must confront and bring <br>
together. A new difference vector is computed, and a new motor command is issued.<br>
<br>
The main representational state that results from integrating all this feedback is likely to <br>
be visual. Representations of many types may, however, may be used in a task.716 This main <br>
state takes as input a combination of previous perceptions (visual and proprioceptive) <br>
with anticipations that derive from efference copy (via short-term motor memory). <br>
Although researchers sometimes call this state a belief and other states predictions,717 <br>
there is no appeal to any propositional capacity in relevant visuomotor explanations. <br>
Beliefs may figure in a larger story. But the states at issue here are visual perceptions, visual <br>
perceptual memories, or visual-perceptual anticipations. Influence of perceptual anticipa-<br>
tion on perception is well attested—quite apart from the actional system. Feedback loops <br>
among memory, anticipation, and perception, and intermodal influence among percep-<br>
tions occur in vision as well as conation. Such interactions are perceptual-level.<br>
<br>
Figure 14.1 depicts main feedback-loops that are commonly postulated in motor psych-<br>
ology. Visual perception figures in the processing throughout. The chart does not mark all <br>
its roles. For example, not marked is the fact that vision feeds the motor-command con-<br>
troller after the motor command is issued, but before the body movement fully realizes the <br><br>
