section. In the next section, I connect some specifics about spatial perceptual constancies <br>
with attribution of body types.<br>
<br>
In the scientific literature on categorization, it is more common to find accounts of cat-<br>
egorization of “objects” than accounts of categorizations of <i>body</i>, although some authors <br>
make a distinction.91 As I use the term, ‘<i>object</i>’ applies not only to bodies, but to clouds, <br>
piles of sand, and surfaces. In my usage, ‘<i>body</i>’ applies to any 3-D, relatively rigid entity <br>
with a connected outer boundary, where the boundary separates the body from other <br>
en tities in space. Rocks, in addition to animal-bodies, count as bodies. Faces are often <br>
called ‘objects’. I count them body-parts. They are, for primates, by far the most per cep-<br>
tual ly important body-part. Since the objects that are primary for relatively advanced vis-<br>
ual systems are bodies, I focus on body categorization.<br>
<br>
I focus first on the most generic attribution of <i>body</i>. Most of what I say applies also to <br>
perceptual attribution of specific types of bodies, grouped as having characteristic shapes <br>
(like reptile-shaped reptile-body or banana-shaped banana-body).<br>
<br>
The most generic type of body is a relatively rigid entity <i>with a 3-D relatively cohesive <br>
and connected outer boundary</i>, <i>where the boundary marks some spatial separation</i>.92 Call <br>
this type of shape ‘<i>generic shape</i>’. (There are 2-D analogs of generic shape for surfaces.) <br>
I call the generic type of body ‘<i>generic body</i>’. Usually, I use ‘body’ as shorthand for ‘generic <br>
body’. All more specific body types—say, a <i>banana-body</i>—are also instances of <i>generic <br>
body</i>. Cohesion of a 3-D volume shape is, roughly, spatial connection of all points or <br>
regions. Having a connected outer boundary is, roughly, having a perimeter inside which <br>
all points or regions of the shape fall. Attribution of <i>generic body</i> normally uses attribution <br>
of 3-D generic shape as the central cue.93 Attributives for <i>body</i> can have different modes of <br>
presentation, depending on how generic shape is presented—its orientation, shading, and <br>
the specific shape a body has on the perceptual occasion.<br>
<br>
Perceptual attribution of generic shape triggers perceptual attribution of generic body, <br>
unless a previous perception blocks anticipation that the generic shape remains over time. <br>
For example, if before one perceives an object, one perceives it to be poured (say, sand <br>
poured into a pile), the representation of a generic 3-D volume shape will not trigger attri-<br>
bution of <i>body</i>.<br><br>

tion occurs only post-perceptually. I criticize this view in <i>Origins of Objectivity</i>, 438–450.<br>
93 I say ‘normally’, because perceptual attribution of body can in principle lean on priming or memory to get <br>
to a body attribution more directly. There is some evidence that perceptual systems sometimes take “short-cut <br>
bets” from representation of surfaces oriented in 3-D space to perceptual attribution of body: P. Sinha and <br>
T. Poggio, ‘Role of Learning in Three-Dimensional Form Perception’, <i>Nature</i> 384 (1996), 460–463. These special <br>
cases are always subject to confirmation from attribution of 3-D generic shape. A short-cut attribution of <i>body</i> on <br>
the basis of perceptual attribution of a surface would be cancelled if micro-second-longer exposure did not sup-<br>
port attribution of 3-D generic volume shape.</div>
