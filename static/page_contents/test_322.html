322 The Iconic Nature of Perception</div>

mappings between the format of perceptual representation and elements in the physical <br>
environment.<br>
<br>
The master mistake in Fodor’s reasoning is methodological. It is the mistake of reason-<br>
ing to a semantics for pictures from armchair reflection on the format of pictures, rather <br>
than from the psychological and conventional capacities that underlie their use. One can-<br>
not understand the semantics of <i>anything</i> by starting from reasoning about its format—<br>
iconic or otherwise. One must begin by reflecting on usage and underlying psychological <br>
competencies.<br>
<br>
Before criticizing Fodor’s conclusions more specifically, I set out the most generic <br>
 representational kinds that ground semantics for perception, maps, and realist pictures. <br>
The representational function of all these kinds is to pick out particulars by referential <br>
applications.347 These kinds of representation pick out particulars (specific surfaces, bod-<br>
ies, places, and so on) partly via contextual, causal relations to those particulars and partly <br>
by discriminating them from other contextually relevant particulars by characterizing <br>
them in terms of properties, relations, or kinds. In all cases, this function is grounded in <br>
representational psychological competencies.<br>
<br>
These two sub-functions—picking out and characterizing—are fulfilled by the three types <br>
of semantical primitives in iconic representations. (See Chapter 2, the section The Three <br>
Fundamental Representational Constituents in Perceptual States.)<br>
<br>
One type is comprised of <i>referential applications</i>—events or other occurrent items <br>
whose representational function is to apply the characterizers so as to pick out or refer to <br>
particulars. The referential applications are individuated by occurrences. They are thus not <br>
freely repeatable.<br>
<br>
A second type of semantical primitive marks the general, freely repeatable competence <br>
in referential application. This type consists of <i>referential schematic</i> competence for <br>
demonstrative-like or indexical-like application. The repeatable linguistic competence to <br>
apply ‘this’ or ‘here’ on particular occasions is marked by repeatable words ‘this’ and ‘here’. <br>
These words do not in themselves refer to anything. They refer through events of referential <br>
application. Similarly, referential applications in pictures, maps, and perceptions are exercises <br>
of schematic, repeatable referential competencies that are marked by referential schemas.<br>
<br>
The third type of semantical primitive is comprised of attributives—abilities that func-<br>
tion to indicate a property, relation, or kind, and to attribute it to entities referred to by the <br>
referential applications of attributives. Attributives are characterizers. When they are applied, <br>
attributives function to characterize entities picked out by the referential applications.<br>
<br>
I believe that the points just made about the representational constituents and represen-<br>
tational structure of realist pictures, maps, and perception are apriori. They are warranted <br>
by reflecting on the representational functions and competencies involved in these types <br>
of representation. In the case of perception, the practice of perceptual psychology accords <br>
with the account. That science takes perceptual states both to pick out particulars and to <br>
characterize them. Specific representational units with these functions are delineated <br>
empirically.<br>
<br>
Thus I believe that it is apriori false that pictures or perceptions in being iconic are rep-<br>
resentations with no representational, or semantical, structure.<br><br>
