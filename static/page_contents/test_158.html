two competencies’ being activated by sensory stimulation. The two competencies are the <br>
schematic referential competence and the attributive competence. The former represents <br>
nothing when not exercised. The attributive competence indicates attributes, but does not <br>
attribute them or characterize anything with them, when not exercised.<br>
<br>
Both referential applications and attributive characterizations can fail their representa-<br>
tional functions. Perceptual attributives can fail to indicate a real attribute and/or fail to <br>
veridically attribute any attribute that they do indicate and attribute. Referential applica-<br>
tions can fail to refer to anything. In such a case, associated perceptual attributives fail to <br>
attribute veridically whatever attribute that they indicate. I discuss referential failures later <br>
in this section.<br>
<br>
If any element fails its representational function, the perceptual state is not veridical <br>
(accurate). If all succeed, the perceptual state is veridical (accurate). If the perceptual state <br>
involves no referential illusion, it is a perception of one or more particulars. Then the ref-<br>
erential applications succeed in referring. If what is seen as a body is a body, not a cloud of <br>
gas looking like a body, the applied attributive attributes the kind <i>body</i> accurately. What is <br>
perceived, if anything, is the referent of a referential application. Usually, large numbers of <br>
referential applications pick out particulars. In vision, we see multitudes of particulars via <br>
nearly every perceptual state.<br>
<br>
There are, of course, cases of partial veridicality. A perceiver can see a green body as a <br>
red body. Then since one perceives the body, the referential application guided by an <br>
attributive for <i>body</i> succeeds in referring. The body attributive indicates the kind <i>body</i> and <br>
attributes it accurately to the perceived body. The attributive for red indicates redness, but <br>
redness is mis-attributed, via the attributive, to the body. So there are elements of accuracy <br>
and inaccuracy in the perception.<br>
<br>
So far the discussion oversimplifies representational structure of perception in several <br>
respects. There are attributives for parts of surfaces, surfaces, bodies, and spatial rela-<br>
tions among them—not to speak of instances of colors, textures, shapes, motion, and <br>
so on. In all normal perception, many different attributives are applied to many different <br>
perceived particulars.<br>
<br>
When one sees a brown, cubical body as such, one’s perception involves perceptual <br>
attributives—brown, cubical, and body. There are inevitably more. For example, cubical is <br>
an instance of a generic shape with a closed boundary. This shape is known to be central <br>
to identifying bodies. There is an attributive for the generic shape as well as one for the <br>
specific shape, <i>cubical</i>. Similarly, if one perceives something as brown, one normally per-<br>
ceives it as being of a very specific shade of brown. One always perceives it as colored. <br>
(See Chapter 3, the section Visual Body Categorization; Chapter 4, the section <br>
Taxonomic Hierarchies in Perception.) There are also surface and edge at tribu-<br>
tives, size attributives, texture attributives, color and lightness attributives.<br>
<br>
Most perception is organized spatially and temporally. The spatial structure normally <br>
induces not only a spatial framework within which various perceived objects are placed, <br>
but also a part–whole structure for perceived entities. Particulars are perceived as being in <br>
various regions and as being in various spatial relations to one another, for example, depth <br>
relations between them or between a focally perceived entity and a background. In vision <br>
and touch, one perceives not only bodies and surfaces, but parts of the bodies and sur-<br>
faces, all in spatial relations to one another. To perceive a whole body or surface, one must <br>
see parts of it, edges of it, and so on. Each perceived part is perceptually referred to by a </div>
