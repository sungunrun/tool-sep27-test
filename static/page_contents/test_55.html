Perception as Objectification 55</div>

framework for understanding ‘perceptual’, ‘perceptual constancy’, ‘perceptual system’. The <br>
framework will be filled in by understanding a range of cases that perceptual psych ology <br>
counts as perceptual constancies, delineating those cases partly by using the notion of <br>
objectification. I <i>define</i> none of these notions—representation, perception, perceptual sys-<br>
tem, objectification. I hope to provide guidance in understanding how to use them and in <br>
understanding a border between perception and non-perceptual sensing, hence an advent <br>
of natural kinds individuated by veridicality conditions.<br>
<br>
Perceptual states are distinctive among sensory states in having representational con-<br>
tents with veridicality conditions as a key aspect of the psychological kinds that the states <br>
instantiate. Representational contents of perceptual states are always what they are by vir-<br>
tue of patterns of causal interaction with a subject matter—principally the distal en vir on-<br>
ment—and with other psychological states. The patterns with other psychological states <br>
are fundamentally perceptual competencies and practical uses of those competencies. The <br>
constancies are capacities to employ any member of a network of different possible per-<br>
ceptual states to represent a given environmental attribute or particular.<br>
<br>
Implementations of perceptual constancies are lower-level analogs of descriptor-aided <br>
pointings to the environment, and inferences among psychological states, that determine <br>
the meanings of words. The dependence of the nature of the representational content, and <br>
the veridicality conditions of perceptual states, on perceptual constancies is parallel to the <br>
dependence of linguistic meaning on use, a dependence that Wittgenstein emphasized. So <br>
in reflecting on perceptual constancies, guided by the notion of objectification, one gains <br>
insight into what make representational contents the contents that they are.<br>
<br>
Empirically finding instances of perceptual constancies is a good way of empirically <br>
isolating instances of perception and distinguishing it from non-perceptual sensory regis-<br>
tration. Perceptual constancies are closer to observation, and easier to theorize about <br>
empirically, than simple specifications of perceptual states as sensory states with represen-<br>
tational content, or veridicality conditions. One can find the scope and limits of the per-<br>
ceptual by reflecting on cases that science counts as perceptual constancies, utilizing the <br>
notion of objectification to help one understand why the cases are grouped together and <br>
counted as perceptual. Objectification is, again, a process of separating cues to a constant <br>
attribute or particular in the environment (or, in the case of proprioception, the body) <br>
from other aspects of proximal stimulations.<br>
<br>
Many types of perceptual constancy figure in perceptual systems. Shape constancy is a <br>
capacity to perceive a given shape as that shape under a significant variety of stimulus <br><br>

<b>FOOTNOTES</b><br>
<b>Cont FN</b>Morgan’s idea that perceptual constancies show up in plants is based on a misconception of perceptual con-<br>
stancy as any computational invariance that crosses different proximal stimulations and that may depend on <br>
more than one cue. (No perceptual psychologist would count processes in plants as exercising perceptual con-<br>
stancies.) I discuss this sort of misconception in Chapter 3. (See also note 47 below, which cites a misconception <br>
of my own that may have misled Morgan about perceptual constancies.) I believe that all computational causal <br>
explanations of state formation in plants can be understood in terms of the formation of biologically functional <br>
states that are abstractions from some features of proximal stimuli, with no essential invocation of representa-<br>
tional content. Morgan does not even to try to show this view to be mistaken. In causal explanations in botany <br>
there is no need to <i>individuate</i> any of a plant’s states in terms of representational content, in order to make <br>
the explanations work. The causal explanations in botany take states to be individuated in bio-chemical terms. The <br>
only explanations that make essential reference to environmental attributes are explanations that appeal to <br>
the states’ biological functions. To understand these matters, one must examine actual explanations, not simply <br>
cite the talk of scientists. Causal explanations that appeal systematically to accuracy do not occur in botany. They <br>
do occur in perceptual psychology.</div>
