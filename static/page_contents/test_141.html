(referring) competence succeeds in referring to a (perceived) particular, and the exercise <br>
of the guidance-discriminatory competence represents that particular accurately as an <br>
instance of the specific type that that competence representationally responds to. <br>
(Premise)<br>
<br>
16. Since the function of the guidance-discriminatory competence is to apply types <br>
accurately to instances of the type that that competence representationally responds to, <br>
exercise of the guidance-discriminatory competence is <i>attribution</i>. It is a competence to <br>
characterize particulars by representing them as instances of specific represented types.150 <br>
(Premise)<br>
<br>
17. So in every perceptual state, each occurrent perceptual referential application must <br>
be associated with—guided by—at least one applied perceptual attributive that functions <br>
to represent the (purportedly) picked out particular as being of some type. (From 14., 15., <br>
and 16.)<br><br>
An upshot of the argument is that the function of perception is to pick out by specify-<br>
ing. The discriminatory specification functions to discriminate the perceived particular <br>
not only from other particulars in the occurrent causal chain that might in principle have <br>
been perceived, but were not. It also usually functions to discriminate the particular from <br>
others that are also currently perceived, and of course from other particulars that the com-<br>
petence is incapable of perceiving.<br>
<br>
Some remarks on step 11.: A natural worry is that there might be multiple particulars in <br>
an occurrent causal chain leading to an occurrent perceptual state that the guiding-<br>
discriminatory attributive is accurate of. Then one might worry that there would be no <br>
relevant discrimination. Of course, the argument does not require that the competence be <br>
representationally successful in every case. Even so, perception is approximately success-<br>
ful much of the time. If there were reason to believe that there were normally multiple <br>
satisfiers of perceptual attributives in occurrent chains of causation leading to the percep-<br>
tual states in which the attributives were exercised, we might have reason to think that <br>
something was wrong with present account of discrimination.<br>
<br>
The threat of this consideration is easily overrated. Applications of perceptual at tribu-<br>
tives are not uses of linguistic predicates susceptible to applying to entities by accident—<br>
applying to anything that happens to satisfy the predicate. Perceptual attributives are <br>
competencies to characterize particulars <i>perceptually</i>. Individuals cannot perceptually <br>
characterize something that they lack a competence to perceive. So if an individual lacks a <br>
competence, in the context, to perceive a particular in the causal chain, no perceptual <br>
attributive can apply “by accident” to it.<br>
<br>
Individuals lack perceptual competencies to perceive (as opposed to informationally <br>
register) the proximal stimulus, the registration of the proximal stimulus, and all internal <br>
events in the perceptual system that are caused by that registration. Individuals also <br><br>
