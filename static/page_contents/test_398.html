<i>tableware</i>, <i>tool</i>, <i>toy</i>, <i>vegetable</i>, <i>vehicle</i>, <i>weapon</i>.465 (At the perceptual level, all these categories <br>
should be regarded in terms of their body-shape-size counterparts. None should be under-<br>
stood as natural kinds. Which, if any of the functionally individuated kinds (such as <i>tool</i> <br>
and <i>footwear</i>) are perceptually represented is an open question. See Chapter 4, the section <br>
Two Methodological Points About Natural-Kind and Functional <br>
Attributives and Chapter 16, the section Conceptual Short-Term Memory.) <br>
Perceptual systems group bodies by shape, size, and motion, via automatic processes of <br>
perceptual learning, as well as via innate templates. The idea that the visual system has for <br>
each of these categories a few low-level feature detectors that generate a pre-attentive <br>
transformation that triggers the category is not plausible.<br>
<br>
What of the third consideration advanced by Evans and Treisman? This is the claim that <br>
generic body-shape processing would be too complex for a perceptual system. There is no <br>
evidence that generic body-shape representation is processed later than representation of <br>
body-parts. VanRullen proposed that familiar body-shapes are “hardwired” prior to stimu-<br>
lus. Activation of groups of neurons that track such shapes (or shape-groupings) can be <br>
fast and direct, not complicated.466 Relevant hardwiring does not imply an innate origin. It <br>
indicates a pattern of psychological and neuronal connectivity that can derive from previ-<br>
ous learning. The process can connect to a template whose similarity to a new stimulus <br>
can trigger fast response. Evidence for fast processing of various body-shapes has accumu-<br>
lated. I discuss it in Chapter 11.<br>
<br>
VanRullen’s proposal, now widely accepted, was part of a larger diagnosis of Treisman’s <br>
binding thesis. Treisman’s research was almost entirely on artificial stimuli not often <br>
encountered in natural scenes. Subjects viewed rectangular bars or other simple shapes, <br>
gratings of color bands or lightness bands, and shapes of alphabetical letters in various <br>
orientations. The colors of the bars and other shapes were entirely arbitrary—purple ‘x’s, <br>
green ‘y’, blue bars, and so on. The majority of psychophysical experiments on vision have <br>
been similar. These are not the sorts of objects that visual systems evolved to cope with. <br>
Nor were they the familiar objects and feature-combinations that humans learned to inter-<br>
act with. The assumption was that very simple shapes and colors are good objects on <br>
which to test typical powers of visual systems. Simplicity for the researcher is not necessar-<br>
ily ease for visual systems. In fact, simplicity impoverishes cues.<br>
<br>
Natural scenes that shaped perception, in evolution or in individuals’ learning histories, <br>
are much richer than the arrays commonly used in psychological laboratories. Natural <br>
scenes exhibit complex patterns that perceptual systems have been successful in mining for <br>
cues that facilitate representation of environmental attributes. Some patterns comprise deep <br>
but not law-like facts about viewing conditions—such as that most perceptual objects are <br>
bulgy rather than concave. Some involve statistical regularities that are not intuitively salient.<br>
<br>
Here is an example of such a regularity. The probability that a pair of contour segments <br>
that are seen on either side of an occlusion are segments of a single edge of an object <br><br>
