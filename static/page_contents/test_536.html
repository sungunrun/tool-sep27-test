536 Perceptual Attention</div>
<br><br>
Object-based attention shows “chunking”. Properties of an object are remembered bet-<br>
ter and in greater quantity if the object is attended to than if the same properties were <br>
distributed among several objects.741 If an object is attended to, the attention automatically <br>
spreads across the object.742<br>
<br>
The phenomenon of chunking led some to hold that attended objects carry a fixed <br>
memory cost, and that all an object’s visible properties can be remembered if the object is <br>
attended. The idea was that a fixed number of objects can be attended, tracked, and <br>
remembered at a given time. This “slot” model of attention and memory turned out to be <br>
mistaken, as we shall see in Chapter 16, the section Working Memory. Moreover, some <br>
properties of attended-to objects—specifically generic spatial properties—tend to be <br>
remembered better than others—for example color properties or specific-shape proper-<br>
ties—in cases of attention overload. It remains true that attention to whole objects seems <br>
to lower the cost of remembering many of their properties, other things equal.<br>
<br>
The dynamics of multiple-object tracking has been investigated in some detail. Given <br>
10 similar-looking circle-discs, subjects can track four or five attended ones, as the discs <br>
move randomly. Subjects can track them behind occlusions if their motion remains regu-<br>
lar. Changes in specific shape or color have no substantial effect. There is evidence that <br>
attention is distributed among the attended objects, not distributed across space, and not <br>
tied to specific properties—beyond the generic shape, or whole-boundedness, of the <br>
objects.743 Natural parts of objects are common targets of attention. Groups of objects in <br>
natural patterns are easily grouped and attended to.744<br>
<br>
Like other types of attention, object-based attention can be covert or overt, endogenous <br>
or exogenous. Endogenous initiations are grounded in the superior parietal lobe and pre-<br>
frontal areas.745 They can affect areas that support categorization (like IT and the fusiform <br>
face area). As noted, they can affect anatomically early areas, like V1–V4, that support vis-<br>
ual processing.746 Object-based attention can control recent perception and present tasks.<br>
