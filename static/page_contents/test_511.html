Form of Relatively Primitive Conative States 511</div>
<br><br>
Determining the structure of such actions requires empirical investigation. Introspection <br>
does not go far.<br>
<br>
This point raises a caution flag. Our perceptual and actional systems derive evolutionar-<br>
ily from those of simpler animals. Many animals whose actions are guided by perception <br>
lack propositional attitudes altogether. Many of our instinctive movements are guided <br>
by non-propositional representational states. On the other hand, since beliefs and <br>
propositional-level intentions can be unconscious, one cannot determine via introspec-<br>
tion that they do <i>not</i> figure in an action. We can learn that we have relevant propositional <br>
states through experimental probing. It is a matter for empirical investigation what role, if <br>
any, such states play in any given action.<br>
<br>
So one cannot safely assume, even for relatively primitive human bodily actions, that <br>
beliefs and intentions play no supplementary guiding role at all. One must investigate how <br>
propositional attitudes and sub-propositional states interact. Most such interaction is <br>
unconscious. So the study must be subtle. We do not know enough to make confident <br>
assertions about these matters. What is clear is that action theory cannot confine itself to <br>
propositional attitude psychology. One must discover the structure of representationally <br>
guided action through empirical experimentation.<br>
<br>
The cautionary point may seem simple and obvious. It needs to be made. Most work in <br>
action theory assumes an account of bodily action that features intentions and other <br>
propos itional attitudes. Even some philosophers who doubt the generality of such <br>
accounts do so by citing cases of action in which no belief or intention is <i>introspectable</i>. <br>
Their arguments assume that because, in the given case, no belief or intention is intro-<br>
spectable, no such propositional attitude is in play. Or they assume that since the relevant <br>
states (whether specificational or conative) are not under conscious control, there must <br>
not be any role for belief or intention.684 A belief is an attitude in propositional form that <br>
has the representational function of being true. The function and structure of a psy cho-<br>
logic al state is often not open to introspection. The unconscious structure of psy cho logic-<br>
al ly guided action is too fast, complex, and subtle to be accessible through such methods. <br>
Many beliefs and intentions are not conscious, or consciously controlled.<br>
<br>
It is reasonable to believe, however, that many simple human actions do not result from <br>
goal-settings by propositional-level intentions. There are too many goal-settings that <br>
occur too fast and too automatically in response to small contextual changes in perceptual <br>
input, to result from reasoning or other propositional abilities. Moreover, as we shall see, <br>
sometimes propositional beliefs and intentions come apart from underlying motor repre-<br>
sentations.685 Much conation occurs below the level of reasoning. Individual-guided, as <br>
opposed to exogenously controlled, scans by the eyes and unconscious changes in quick <br>
hand-movements in response to current abnormal conditions, which are apparently not <br>
recognized in propositional beliefs and intentions, are actions whose explanations do not <br>
plausibly call for propositional intentions. Further, and importantly, it is certain that ani-<br>
mals that lack propositional attitudes engage in acts guided by perception.<br>
<br>
Even when beliefs and intentions, conscious or unconscious, cause simple perceptually <br>
guided actions in humans, perception, its satellite capacities (perceptual memory and <br><br>
