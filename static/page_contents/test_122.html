122 Some BaSicS aBout PercePtion and PercePtual SyStemS</div>

To have a perceptual representation for <i>body</i>, or <i>dog</i>, or <i>x-ray machine</i>, or <i>danger</i>, or <br>
<i>cause</i>, or <i>act</i>, one would have to apply the representation via perceptual representations of <br>
characteristic shapes, sizes, and/or motions. One cannot visually perceive a body, dog, <br>
x-ray machine, cause, act, or danger, much less perceive it as such, without perceiving it by <br>
way of its spatial or motion characteristics. To have perceptual representations for the <br>
types of attributes exemplified by the italicized words, one must have psychological cap-<br>
aci ties, for discrimination, beyond capacities to attribute even very specific groupings <br>
of shapes, sizes, and motions that regularly mark the kinds indicated by italics. A very <br>
specific grouping of sizes and shapes that corresponds to dogs shows that an individual <br>
perceives and tracks dogs, and that dogs are of some importance to the individual’s psych-<br>
ology. It does not constitute a representation of entities of those shapes and sizes <i>as</i> dogs. <br>
Being a dog is over and above being a body with a characteristic shape and size. Both are <br>
prevalent in the environment that human perceivers occupy.<br>
<br>
The requirement does not force perceptual systems, understood to include auxiliaries <br>
to perception like anticipation and memory, to be able to discriminate an attribute <br>
from every possible look-alike. It requires only that they be able, in some circumstances, <br>
to discriminate instances of any different attributes that the system has attributives for. <br>
Perceptual systems have attributives only for <i>environmental alternatives</i>. These are <br>
 different attributes that are prevalent in an individual’s environment and that either often <br>
occur together, or are difficult to discern from one another. The individual’s environment <br>
(what I call ‘the <i>normal environment</i>’) is the environment in which the perceiver’s system <br>
gained the attributives that it has. If an entity is of a sort that a perceptual system cannot <br>
discern, it lacks an attributive for it.129<br>
<br>
For example, having a connected outer boundary is an environmental alternative to <br>
being a body. Both properties are common in mammalian perceivers’ normal en vir on-<br>
ments. Clouds and piles of sand, as well as bodies, have connected outer boundaries. <br>
So having a connected outer boundary is a different attribute from being a body. Being a <br>
dog-body is an environmental alternative to being a dog. In each pair, each property is <br>
prevalent in perceivers’ normal environments. Both often occur together. So they are <br>
en vir on mental alternatives. One can visually perceive something as a body only by per-<br>
ceiving it as having a connected outer boundary. So to have a perceptual attributive for <br>
<i>body</i> as well as a perceptual attributive for having a connected outer boundary, one must <br>
have different capacities for applying them in perceptual discrimination. Attributives for <br>
<i>body</i> meet the requirement. We have a sensory anticipation of bodies’ holding shape and <br>
having internal integrity that we could lack in having an attributive for <i>connected outer <br>
boundary</i>. For the pair, <i>dog-body</i> (which moves in such and such way) and <i>dog,</i> perceivers <br>
lack a sensory discriminating capacity. Perceptual systems attribute only <i>dog-body</i> <br>
(by shape, size, and motion), not <i>dog</i>.<br>
<br>
To summarize: Take any non-classical perceivable attribute <i>A+</i> that is individuated by <br>
(or constitutively <i>is</i>) more than its having such classical attributes as shape, size, color, <br>
motion. Suppose that one can represent <i>A+</i> only by perceptually representing some grouping <br>
of shapes, sizes, colors, and/or motions. The classical types of attributive trigger the attributive <br>
for <i>A+</i>. To have a perceptual attributive, A+, for <i>A+</i>, the perceptual system—understood to <br><br>
