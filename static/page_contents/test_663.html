Uses and Misuses of the Term ‘Cognition’ 663</div>
<br><br>
I assume, from the etymology of ‘cognition’, that cognition is closely related to know-<br>
ledge. The clearest, most developed notions of knowledge are <i>know-how</i> and <i>knowledge-<br>
that</i>. Insofar as know-how amounts to procedural competence alone, it is not a type of <br>
cognition. It is not even representational.1078 Know-how that does involve propositional <br>
knowledge (as a human’s knowing how to make shoes does) is a type of practical cogni-<br>
tion. Whether there is an intermediate type of know-how that could count as a type of <br>
cognition, I leave open.<br>
<br>
The <i>central</i> type of knowledge relevant to understanding cognition is knowledge-that. <br>
Knowledge-that entails propositional belief. The that-clause in ‘knows that . . .’ locutions is <br>
propositional. I assume that the that-clause marks the propositionality of the knowledge’s <br>
representational content. This assumption is common in ordinary usage. So knowledge-<br>
that and belief-that are paradigmatic cases of cognition. I broaden natural usage to include <br>
any propositional state, as a core type of cognition. Any such state bears straightforward <br>
propositional inferential relations to knowledge-that and to propositional knowing-how. <br>
So fears-that, intends-that, remembers-that, imagines-that are all instances of cognition, <br>
on this usage. This broadening is meant to target a <i>level</i> of representational competence—a <br>
propositional level. The level includes capacity for propositional inference—propositional <br>
reasoning. I take propositional representation to be at a different level from perceptual <br>
representation. It evolved later. It involves a more complex semantical structure and differ-<br>
ent representational form. It constitutes new sophisticated competencies. I postpone dis-<br>
cussing whether there are non-propositional cognitive competence levels. (See this <br>
chapter, the section What Should Count as Cognition?.)<br>
<br>
The term ‘knowledge’ is used loosely in visual psychology. Uses include all sorts of rep-<br>
resentation, even mere information registration, that no theorist of knowledge would <br>
take seriously as candidates for knowledge.1079 For example, an association of a shape <br>
with a color in memory is referenced as ‘knowledge of the world’, and as cognition, with-<br>
out any discussion.1080 In such cases, there is no attempt to show that concepts, beliefs, or <br>
prop os ition al representations are involved. Mere familiarity with a type of scene from <br>
stored sketch-like models that contribute to enhancing visual processing is counted <br><br>

<b>FN</b>1078 A few philosophers think that all know-how is knowing-that: J. Stanley and T. Williamson, ‘Knowing <br>
How’, <i>Journal of Philosophy</i> 98 (2001), 411–444. This view is innocent of any reflection on what science says about <br>
these matters. It is out of touch with scientific accounts of motor action and skill. Relevant sciences do not, and <br>
need not, attribute <i>propositional</i> attitudes like knowing-that in accounting for various types of know-how.<br>

“cognition” is taken to come from mid-level visual areas. See Bannert and Bartels, ‘Decoding the Yellow of a Gray <br>
Banana’. It is possible that this is an instance of use of ‘cognition’ (and even ‘knowledge’) that does not purport to <br>
contrast cognitive systems with perceptual systems. However, it muddies understanding.</div>
