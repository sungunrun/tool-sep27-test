I turn now to the three lines of scientific thought that led many perceptual psycholo-<br>
gists to think that prior to applications of attention, accumulation of memory-based rep-<br>
resentations, or conceptual input, we do not perceive bodies or their 3-D spatial properties. <br>
In these sections, I begin citing evidence for the contrary view just outlined.<br><br>

<b>Marr’s 2½-D Sketch<br><br>
</div>
</b>David Marr postulated a 2½-D sketch as the terminus of perception proper. Often this <br>
sketch was also termed the endpoint of <i>early vision</i>. ‘Early vision’ does not have an agreed, <br>
precise application. Early vision was, and often is, regarded as concerned with grouping and <br>
segmenting properties of the visual image, such as edges, proximity of edges, colinearity of <br>
edges, joining edges into contours, grouping similar areas of lightness, registration of tex-<br>
tures, registration of motion, finding 2-D boundaries in the retinal image, and so on. Visual <br>
sensitivities to smaller areas of the retinal image are grouped with similar areas to segment <br>
larger areas. Broadly similar operations work in parallel on all areas of the retinal image. <br>
Early vision was regarded by Marr as proceeding through pre-perceptual registration of the <br>
retinal image up to relatively primitive perceptual sketches of environmental surfaces.<br>
<br>
According to Marr, the 2½-D sketch—the culmination of both early vision and visual <br>
perception <i>proper</i>—consisted of representations of surfaces, not 3-D volume shapes or <br>
bodies. Shimon Ullman subsequently held that shifts of attention in visual routines were <br>
necessary for fully 3-D perceptual representation.400 He took a 2½-D sketch to locate sur-<br>
faces purely in relation to the viewer and not in relation to one another, although the sur-<br>
faces could be in various 3-D orientations—undulating or slanted backwards in 3-D space, <br>
for example. Surfaces were taken not to be represented as in spatial relations to one <br>
another. Ullman claimed that perceiving objects as being in even simple spatial relations <br>
to one another requires visual routines.401<br>
<br>
Pre-perceptual <i>registrations</i> of surfaces in the proximal stimulus are indeed formed <br>
before visual <i>representation</i> of 3-D volume shapes. Representation of visible surfaces of <br>
such shapes is not formed later than representation of the volume shapes. However, the <br>
idea that there is a major cut, a distinctive stage in perceptual processing, that corresponds <br>
to the 2½-D sketch has not survived in psychophysics.<br>
<br>
There is also evidence that in first-pass V1 and V2, prior to recurrent processing and <br>
prior to triggering perceptual constancies, relative disparity relations are computed before <br>
absolute disparity relations operating on regions of the retinal image.402 So there remains a <br><br>
