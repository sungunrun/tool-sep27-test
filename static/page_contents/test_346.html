346 The Iconic Nature of Perception</div>

attributes like aspects of a whole shape, or surfaces of a body, that are out of view by repre-<br>
senting the body as having a specific whole shape: aspect of the whole rounded shape <br>
[plotted in a specific way in the spatial framework] that completes that aspect [where ‘that <br>
aspect’ picks out the aspect of the whole shape that is seen]. The unseen particular and its <br>
shape-aspect (trope) are representationally determined by attribution, not by referentially <br>
picking them out. The unseen items are determined by “description” not acquaintance, to <br>
use Russell’s terms. Of course, I use the terms here in intuitive ways, rather than in his <br>
technical senses. Here description is perceptual attribution.<br>
<br>
The representation of the unseen surfaces and shape-aspects is attributional, hence <br>
ability-general and formally general, though in principle they could be semantically sin-<br>
gular. Perceptual representation does not demonstratively pick out instances of unseen <br>
aspects. It relies on attribution of attributes that are anchored in particulars that <i>are</i> <br>
demonstratively picked out. There are no perceptual <i>de re</i> perceptual <i>references</i> to them, <br>
any more than there are perceptual references to interior parts of the body that might be <br>
uniquely located by the perceptual framework, but are not seen. Perception referentially <br>
picks out only perceived particulars.<br>
<br>
I said at the outset of discussion of the three cases that it is plausible that unseen parts <br>
and shape-aspects are perceptually represented. That might be overstating the case. It is <br>
not obvious that they are. I leave open whether perception specifically attributes unseen <br>
surfaces, surface-parts, or shape-aspects that are consequences of whole-shape, surface, <br>
and body attributions that it clearly does make, even under occlusion. I discussed the three <br>
cases on the provisional assumption that it does, or can. It may be that these attributions <br>
are just “implicit”.<br>
<br>
By ‘implicit’, I do not mean that they would be represented unconsciously. I mean that <br>
they would not be represented at all. They would be consequences of representations that <br>
are applied. They would be, in this respect, like the attributive half-way between the <br>
anchor position for the spatial framework and that1 body [that one sees straight-on as <br>
being at a specific distance]. They might be just consequences of a plotting, within a spatial <br>
framework, of the position that the surface, body, and whole shapes occupy. Then percep-<br>
tion would not attribute surfaces, surface-parts, and shape-aspects whose instances are not <br>
seen. Attributives for such attributes would be computational consequences of attributions <br>
to seen wholes and parts. They would be available to perception. They would have poten-<br>
tial applications. They would not actually be exercised. I do think, firmly, that the whole <br>
body, surface, and relevant shape-wholes are perceived and attributed, even when not all <br>
their parts are perceived.<br>
<br>
The possibility that unseen aspects of perceptually attributed wholes are not represented <br>
in perception has some appeal. In probing these matters one should, however, recall that <br>
perceptual anticipatory states or perceptual imagination can explicitly attribute quite spe-<br>
cific surfaces and surface shapes, even though instances of such surfaces and shapes are <br>
not currently perceived, or perceptually referred to. The question is whether perceptual <br>
states do so as well. Relations between non-represented consequences of spatial-framework <br>
plotting and possible attributions of attributes whose instances are not perceived invite <br>
further investigation.</div>
