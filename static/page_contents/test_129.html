configurations of shapes, which are in fact shapes of faces, that are ambiguous as to <br>
whether they are configurations that signal anger-expression or fear-expression. Subjects <br>
either fail to strongly support one characterization over the other, or divide about equally <br>
if forced to characterize. When those subjects are repeatedly exposed to a shape figuration <br>
that clearly signals anger-expression, they tend to characterize the ambiguous con fig ur-<br>
ation as signaling fear-expression. Similarly, if one exposes them repeatedly to clear cases <br>
of shapes that signal fear-expression, they come to characterize the ambiguous con fig ur-<br>
ation as signaling anger-expression.135<br>
<br>
This case illustrates change in perceptual grouping. Before adaptation, the “ambiguous” <br>
configuration was not grouped with either shapes that trigger anger-expression charac-<br>
terizations or shapes that trigger fear-expression characterizations. After adaptation, the <br>
“ambiguous” configuration moves, perhaps temporarily, into one of these groupings. <br>
Perceptual attribution of the most specific shape of the “ambiguous” configuration need <br>
not change. Rather, that specific shape attributive joins other specific shape attributives <br>
after adaptation in new grouping.<br>
<br>
The new grouping grounds a new shape attributive that applies to specific shapes in the <br>
group. Before adaptation, a grouping of different specific shapes all triggered the anger-<br>
expression attributive. There was a fairly generic shape attributive that applied veridically <br>
to all the more specific shapes that would produce the same response. One could call the <br>
relatively generic attributive ‘anger-expression shape’. A <i>functional</i> attributive, anger-<br>
expression, constitutively depends on associating the shape attributive with functionally <br>
relevant responses, for example, anticipations of certain actions.<br>
<br>
Since perceptual attributives are kinds of representational psychological state, and since <br>
an individual’s pattern of responses hinges on the perceptual grouping produced by adap-<br>
tation, the perceptual system forms, perhaps very temporarily, a new perceptual attribu-<br>
tive for a shape grouping, or a new grouping for specific shapes, that is the perceptual basis <br>
for attributing <i>anger-expression</i>. The new shape attributive applies veridically to all the <br>
shapes that would cause attribution of <i>anger-expression</i>, if the shapes were correctly <br>
perceived.<br>
<br>
The case shows that some perceptual attributives are acquired and lost quickly. <br>
Perceptual attributives vary within and across individuals, depending on adaptation <br>
conditions.<br>
<br>
Since anger-expression attributions occur on the basis of occluded shapes, disfigured <br>
faces, and partial face sketches, the range of specific shape-attributives grouped by a face-<br>
recognitional capacity is complex. Local and ephemeral shifts derive from adaptation.<br>
<br>
It would be a mistake to expect a natural gestalt to correspond to “what is in common” <br>
to all the instances of specific shapes that fall into the extension of a relatively generic <br>
shape attributive. Our language has terms like ‘cubical’. This term expresses a concept that <br>
applies to attributes that are instantiated by many approximately cubical shape-instances. <br>
Here we have something like a common shape that marks similarity among all the various <br>
shapes that count as cubical, although they are not geometrically perfect instances of <br><br>
