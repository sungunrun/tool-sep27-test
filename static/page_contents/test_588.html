reject it. Under minimal interference, visual and auditory tasks are independent from one <br>
another, even with high information load for each task. There are working memory sys-<br>
tems in both visual and auditory modalities that are mutually dissociable. There may be an <br>
amodal system as well.869<br>
<br>
The Baddeley model acknowledged linguistic and non-linguistic auditory retention sys-<br>
tems. In fact, both modalities, visual and auditory, have two main sub-types: a type that <br>
retains linguistic and other symbols, and an ordinary perceptual type that retains percep-<br>
tion of non-symbolic aspects of the environment. Thus manipulation of lists of words or <br>
numerals in working memory, such as reversing a list, is an operation on the former type <br>
of working memory. Rotation of images of a scene and attending to aspects of memory of <br>
a recent perception are operations on the latter type.<br>
<br>
Linguistic and non-linguistic kinds of working memory apparently have distinct stor-<br>
age systems. They are mutually dissociable. Brain damage can disrupt either, without dis-<br>
rupting the other.870 There are dissociations <i>within</i> non-symbolic, visual perceptual-level <br>
working memory, with analogs in other perceptual modalities. For example, there are dis-<br>
sociations among memories for faces and houses, manipulable and non-manipulable <br>
objects, and so on.871<br>
<br>
Linguistic VWM and non-linguistic VWM each has a perceptual level. Each has a con-<br>
ceptual level. VWM for language or for numerical symbols is conceptual if what it retains <br>
is the <i>representational</i> or <i>semantic</i> aspects of numerals and words. There is some evidence <br>
that the perceptual retention of linguistic symbols commonly also involves retention of <br>
the content of the symbols. Linguistic and numerical representations constitutively func-<br>
tion in a propositional structure. Insofar as visual representations are embedded in a <br>
propositional structure and that structure marks a capacity for propositional reasoning, <br>
memory of those representations is <i>conceptual</i>. I have no doubt that some manipulations <br>
of some structures in <i>non-linguistic</i> VWM are manipulations of conceptual content, for <br>
perceptual beliefs, for example. It does not follow, of course, that all representations main-<br>
tained in working memory are conceptual.<br>
<br>
Given the now more standard understanding of ‘working memory’, non-linguistic <br>
VWM does not always operate at the conceptual level. A primary function—retaining <br>
perceptual representations—is perceptual-level. Active operations of attention on percep-<br>
tion do not make perception active. One should not think that active conceptual or <br><br>
