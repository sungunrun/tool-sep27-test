552 Perceptual Attention</div>
<br><br>
The superior colliculus and FEF are organized in maps of possible saccade direction <br>
and amplitude. The maps in the two areas are connected systematically.789 In many cases, <br>
these maps correspond better to retinal maps than to maps of environmental space, and <br>
hence initially support only iconic non-perceptual information registration. Specifically, <br>
when neuron firings that have a mapping structure are not selective for color, direction of <br>
motion, or orientation—the first type of attentional initiation, just described—the maps <br>
are not of environmental space, but of the retinal image.790 Even these pre-representational <br>
maps bear systematic mapping relations to neural maps supporting working memory and <br>
neural maps in V4, which include 3-D maps of environmental space. When, after training, <br>
FEF supports genuine representation of distal environmental features that enter into <br>
attention commands, its own maps support representation of relations in 3-D space.<br>
<br>
I now enlarge points about the timing of initiations of attention supported in FEF and <br>
the effects of attention on visual processing supported in V4. As noted, these timings vary <br>
with stimulus complexity, task difficulty, and degree of prior training. A consistent timing <br>
of attention initiation that supports “inefficient” search—search with no prior training and <br>
with relatively complex stimuli—is about 100–110 ms after stimulus onset. The first effects <br>
of such attention in V4 are well within 150 ms, on the order of 125 ms. These are “slow” <br>
initiations and effects. With training and use of long-term memory of past reward or with <br>
simple stimuli, initiations of endogenous attention in FEF are well inside 100 ms; effects in <br>
V4 are in the neighborhood of 100 ms.791 Thus endogenous attention affects visual pro-<br>
cessing in V4—and, via V4, processing in IT—well before arrival of endogenous attention <br>
from parietal areas 150–160 ms post-stimulus-onset.<br>
<br>
To summarize the structure of the attention-initiation system supported in FEF: In <br>
response to visual stimuli, (a) endogenous, covert attention-initiations occur that are <br>
either (a1) pre-representational or (a2) representational. The latter, (a2), are informed by <br>
perceptual representation of foci of attention, and count, in my terminology, as attention <br>
commands. These initiations occur at different speeds, between before 100 ms to 110–120 <br>
ms post-stimulus-onset, depending on stimulus complexity and on whether training and <br>
reward history play a role. The attention initiations function both to guide (b) saccade <br>
initiations, including saccade commands, and to affect (c) perceptual processing in V4 (as <br>
well as in other areas, such as MT). First effects on V4 occur between about 100 ms and <br><br>

purely temporal. They mark percentages of visuo-neurons—those neurons in FEF that function to fire in support <br>
of attention and that project to V4—against time after stimulus onset. The temporal relations are taken to be <br>
causal relations, from the work of Tirin Moore, beginning with Moore and Armstrong, ‘Selective Gating of Visual <br>
Signals by Microstimulation of Frontal Cortex’. Faster speeds than those in inefficient search, including those in <br>
which FEF supports attention commands because of advance training, are supported in Lowe and Schall, <br>
