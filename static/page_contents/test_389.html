Treisman’s Binding Theory 389</div>

challenged the claim that conjoining features requires attention. Treisman followed Houck <br>
and Hoffman in proposing that the conjunctions evinces an early stage of processing that <br>
works on a multi-dimensional feature map and precedes analysis of separable features into <br>
separate uni-dimensional feature maps.433 Such analyzed features were supposed to need <br>
subsequent (re-)binding.<br>
<br>
The key point of a second set of findings was that correct perception of displays of <br>
conjunctions of color and motion could be carried out at the same speeds for different <br>
display sizes. Similar results were found for other types of conjunction, and when different <br>
depth planes for elements in the display were introduced.434 A range of other cases of <br>
“easy” conjunction searches turned up later.435 These findings again challenged the idea <br>
that all information that conjoined features required serial applications of attention. They <br>
also indicated that some such information was genuinely perceptual, in that it operated on <br>
a map of 3-D environmental space.<br>
<br>
Both findings supported postulating early registration of conjunctions of features from <br>
different dimensions.<br>
<br>
In the 1990s, Treisman rejected her view that all feature searches are parallel and all <br>
conjunction searches are serial.436 She acknowledged rapid conjunction searches that do <br>
not depend on serial applications of attention. For her, some were the product of an initial, <br>
first-stage, unconscious registration. Others derived from antecedently encoded feature <br>
combinations or from various types of inhibition of information from registrations unre-<br>
lated to the searched-for target.<br>
<br>
The theory’s key claim remained intact: Usually, separately registered feature informa-<br>
tion could be combined into representations of visual objects with properties from various <br>
dimensions, and consciously located in environmental space, <i>only</i> through serial applica-<br>
tions of attention.437 There remained the basic distinction between feature detection and <br>
feature binding.<br>
<br>
Here are some summary remarks about the history of Feature-Integration Theory. In its <br>
original 1980 version, feature binding had two main forms. One was binding a property in <br>
one dimension with one or more properties in other dimensions. The other was binding a <br>
cluster of properties with a position in environmental space. The two forms were effected <br>
simultaneously, inasmuch as attention operated on a master map of environmental space.438 <br><br>

438 I pass over one major challenge to Feature-Integration Theory from Signal Detection Theory. The chal-<br>
lenge claims that most effects of slowing through display size can be accounted for by natural statistical increases <br>
in uncertainty. See J. Palmer, C. Ames, and D. Lindsey, ‘Measuring the Effect of Attention on Simple Visual Search’, <br>

drops postulation of a feature binding mechanism altogether. For discussion, see Quinlan, ‘Visual (<i>cont.</i>) </div>
