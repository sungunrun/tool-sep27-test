Temporal, Qualitative, and Packaging Iconic Aspects 313</div>

helps render perceptual representation of temporal relations iconic. So the perceptual <br>
attributive occurs before has a non-representational aspect. It is normally applied in a <br>
temporally ordered way. This matching between time in representation and time in the <br>
represented domain figures in representation of motion and other change. Similarly, speed <br>
of movement in the environment is mapped by speed of change across a visual field. The <br>
mapping figures in representation of speed. Speed is a non-representational, natural prop-<br>
erty. Such applications of temporal attributives are iconic.331<br>
<br>
A second non-representational feature of perception that contributes to the iconicity of <br>
perceptual representational content is a group of qualitative aspects of conscious percep-<br>
tual content. In these cases, the natural mapping tends not to be between single perceptual <br>
states and an environmental subject matter. It tends to be between a scaled range of related <br>
perceptual competencies and a scaled range of environment features.<br>
<br>
The experienced loudness of a sound and the experienced quality of a color or lightness <br>
exemplify such qualitative features. Such features are systematically related to physical <br>
 features of the underlying neural firings, and ultimately to quantitative features of the <br>
en vir on men tal parameter—the sound or the color or lightness. Experienced loudness of a <br>
sound is systematically correlated with intensity of firings of auditory receptors, and <br>
intensity of the sound waves striking the ear. Experienced lightness of a white surface cor-<br>
rel ates systematically with high intensity of light waves striking retinal receptors. <br>
Perceptual representation of color and lightness spectra bear systemic scalar relations to <br>
levels of intensity of firings in relevant neural information registrations and of relevant <br>
proximal and distal stimuli. Of course, the mappings must allow for filtering illumination <br>
to indicate lightness. Still, there are natural mappings from intensity levels in the <br>
 perception and underlying neural registrations, on one hand, and intensity levels in en vir-<br>
on men tal phenomena, on the other. These are natural mappings of non-representational <br>
properties. The non-representational properties are aspects of modes of presentation of <br>
<i>representata</i> of perceptual states. Hence they are aspects of representational content, and <br>
psychological kinds. Natural properties are co-opted to serve representational functions.<br>
<br>
Even when a perception is unconscious and lacks an experiential aspect, the physical <br>
parameters that underlie sensory information registration ground the representational <br>
content. There are surely scalar mappings among perceptual representations of color and <br>
lightness spectra, the underlying neural information registrations, and scalar properties of <br>
light intensity in the color and lightness spectra. The structure of unconscious visual per-<br>
ception as of differences among lightnesses of surfaces is systematically correlated with the <br>
spectrum of light intensities, filtered to factor out illumination. So the structure of uncon-<br>
scious visual representation of surface lightness bears systematic structural correlations to <br>
the physical spectrum of light intensities.<br>
<br>
As noted, in perceptual representation, as distinguished from pre-perceptual sensory <br>
registration, the intensity in the representation does not always directly map the intensity <br>
of the color or reflectance. The intensity is affected by filterings of shadows and of <br><br>
