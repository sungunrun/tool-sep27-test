316 The Iconic Nature of Perception</div>

discursive representations from iconic ones’.337 Fodor understands compositionality in <br>
language, which he takes to be non-iconic discursive representation, as follows:<br><br>
A . . . representation in L is syntactically compositional iff [if and only if] its syntactic <br>
<br>
analysis is exhaustively determined by the grammar of L together with the syntactic <br>
<br>
analyses of its lexical primitives. A . . . representation is semantically compositional in L iff <br>
<br>
its semantic interpretation is exhaustively determined by its syntax together with the <br>
<br>
semantic interpretations of its lexical primitives.338<br><br>
The characterization of decompositionality in language is unobjectionable.<br>
<br>
A <i>canonical</i> decomposition is a privileged, correct decomposition. Fodor takes repre-<br>
sentation to be iconic in that it lacks a canonical syntactic or semantic decomposition. He <br>
infers from this view that<br><br>
 (a) iconic representations have no constitutive structure;<br>
<br>
 (b) constituents of iconic representations are homogeneous (‘each constituent contrib-<br>
<br>
utes in the same way’);<br>
<br>
 (c) iconic representations lack logical forms;<br>
<br>
 (d) iconic representations lack a distinction between semantic constituents that con-<br>
<br>
tribute individuals and constituents that contribute properties;<br>
<br>
 (e) iconic representations lack truth [or accuracy] conditions;<br>
<br>
 (f) iconic representations lack ontological commitments;<br>
<br>
 (g) iconic representations do not impose principles of individuation on domains in <br>
<br>
which they are interpreted;<br>
<br>
 (h) iconic representation is not representation-as.339<br><br>
Fodor takes pictures to be paradigms of iconic representation.340 He mentions graphs. <br>
Other than certain psychological states, pictures constitute the only case of iconic repre-<br>
sentation that he discusses in any detail. Fodor’s discussion of pictures is supposed to <br>
 constrain how one thinks about iconicity in perception, and presumably maps.<br>
<br>
Fodor rests most of his reasoning on what he calls ‘the picture principle’.341<br><br>
PP(1): If P is a picture of X, then parts of P are pictures of parts of X.<br><br>
Fodor notes that according to PP(1), ‘<i>all</i> the parts of an icon are <i>ipso facto</i> constituents’. He <br>
argues for the principle as follows:<br><br>

given a natural understanding of ‘logical form’ as applying to propositional structures. I think Fodor intends the <br>
claim more strongly, to mean that iconic representations lack any structure relevant to being veridical.<br>

341 Fodor is not explicit about what he counts as pictures. I focus on realist paintings because they have a rep-<br>
resentational richness that suggests the richness of visual perception. Sketches have much in common with some <br>
types of visual perceptions and perceptual memories. I focus on realist paintings rather than photographs <br>
because they raise fewer questions about their meaning or representational content. Ultimately, however, I think <br>
that photographs are roughly as good for our purposes as realist paintings are.</div>
