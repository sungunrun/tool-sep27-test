similar to working memory. Unlike iconic memory, visual representation in both TSM <br>
and visual working memory is less rich than the nearly eidetic renderings in iconic mem-<br>
ory. Tasking TSM to be a realization of working memory is an undefeated hypothesis.840 <br>
As we shall see, there is evidence that renders the hypothesis an open question.<br>
<br>
Working memory has been much more fully studied than TSM, although the research <br>
has been less rigorous, on average. A lot of experiment on the capacity and precision of <br>
working memory has used change-detection paradigms.841 Such paradigms initially prod-<br>
uced claims of change blindness and a demotion of the role of memory in tracking the envi-<br>
ronment (See Chapter 10, the section Change Detection.) When TSM was compared <br>
to working memory, some scientists re-applied to TSM emphasis on failures of retention.<br>
<br>
The change-detection experiments do show that retention of accessible visual informa-<br>
tion is incomplete, especially in conditions of restricted stimulus exposure.842 But more is <br>
retained than was thought. There is considerable integration across saccades in TSM. The <br>
view that there is little continuity in perception that derives from short-term memory has <br>
receded as applied to TSM, as well as to standard uses of working memory. In fact, reli-<br>
ance on change-detection paradigms to yield insight into TSM tended to mislead. Change <br>
detection experiments tended to test memory over durations much longer than durations <br>
of saccades. More importantly, natural scenes rarely change in major, unexpected ways <br>
during saccades. When such changes occur, there are usually cues just before or after the <br>
saccades that make the changes trackable.843 Current experimentation on TSM, such as <br>
visual-search testing, has greater ecological validity.<br>
<br>
In 1992, an important discovery shaped the investigation of what goes on across sac-<br>
cades and the investigation of how visual stability is achieved despite saccades. Jean-René <br>
Duhamel and colleagues showed that the location of visual sensitivity of neurons in the <br>
parietal cortex shifts location <i>in anticipation</i> of an immediately forthcoming saccade.844 <br>
The sensitivity at the site where the receptive field of the neurons will occupy after the sac-<br>
cade becomes greater <i>before</i> the saccade occurs. For a short time a neuron can respond to <br>
stimuli both in its current receptive field and in its anticipated future receptive field. <br>
Neurons’ sensitivity characteristics are triggered by information about the size and direc-<br>
tion of the upcoming saccade. This change in sensitivity, initiated by proprioceptive feed-<br>
back from anticipated saccades, is called ‘<i>remapping</i>’.<br>
<br>
This finding led to the hypothesis that the visual system operates on this bias: if the target of a <br>
fixation after a saccade is in the same position before and after the saccade, it and the scene <br><br>
