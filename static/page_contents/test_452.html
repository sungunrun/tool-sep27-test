452 Primitive Attribution of Causation, Agency</div>
<br><br>
To represent causation, individuals must be able to distinguish it from other alternative <br>
phenomena that are prevalent in the environment. The form of movement is such an <br>
alternative.<br>
<br>
The Leslie–Keeble experiments elicit something distinctive to causation representation <br>
that differentiates it from representation of relevant movement: an anticipated asymmetry <br>
of roles between mover and moved. The children’s dishabituation when the roles of mover <br>
and moved are reversed shows that they distinguish different patterns that are instances of <br>
the same spatio-temporal pattern: movement-to-contact, followed by movement-away-<br>
from-contact. The distinction supports taking the children to attribute causation, not just <br>
spatio-temporal motion patterns. It does not show what level of representation—perceptual <br>
or supra-perceptual—is engaged.<br>
<br>
Individuals need not <i>understand</i> a difference between causation and pattern of movement. <br>
Capacities to track causal events and to distinguish them from relevant environmental <br>
alternatives ground the representational difference. (See Chapter 4, the section <br>
Representational-Dependence Hierarchies in Perceptual Attribution.) <br>
The capacity to respond differently to causation than to other spatio-temporal movements <br>
that involve contiguity is itself explained by reference to this capacity’s interaction with <br>
causal events, given the ecological centrality of causation.<br>
<br>
Sometimes philosophers and scientists who have come thus far worry over whether it is <br>
correct to attribute to children not only representations for <i>specific</i> kinds of causal events—<br>
representations as of pushes, pulls, and so on—but also <i>generic</i> representations of the <br>
interactions as causal. They accept that the representations push, pull have causal content. <br>
They worry over whether a generic attributive cause can be taken to be in young children’s <br>
repertoires.582<br>
<br>
Such worries are usually grounded in one of two ways. Either they derive from the idea <br>
that a generic attributive, cause, is too abstract to occur in perception. Or they derive from <br>
the idea that relevant capacities involve too little understanding of causation.<br>
<br>
I think such worries misplaced. Perceptual systems make attributions to given particu-<br>
lars at various levels of generality at the same time. Generic attributions are just generic <br>
representational competencies. In attributing specific shapes, like <i>cubical</i>, a visual percep-<br>
tual system also attributes generic shapes, such as <i>connected outer boundary</i>. In tracking <br>
pushes, children also track causation. In fact, the pushes would of little representational <br>
interest if they were not instances of causation. Anticipation of the same asymmetry of <br>
roles shows up in both pushes and pulls.<br>
<br>
These different levels of attribution reflect different levels of grouping exhibited in the <br>
competencies. Infants treat different types of causal relations—pushes, pulls, and so on—<br>
in similar ways. A similar spatio-temporal pattern—contiguity followed by movement of <br>
the affected entity approximately in accord with laws of mechanical motion—triggers rele-<br>
vant representations. The grouping pattern signals representation of the genus causation. <br>
The abstractness in attributives for causation is not incompatible with such attributives’ <br>
occurring in perceptual systems.<br><br>

<b>Cont FN</b>582 For examples of such worries—or doubts on grounds of the “abstractness” of any attributive for causation <br>
as such—see Rips, ‘Causation from Perception’, 93; J. Woodward, ‘Causal Perception and Causal Cognition’, in <br>
J. Roessler, H. Lerman, and N. Eilan eds., <i>Perception, Causation, and Objectivity</i> (Oxford: Oxford University Press, <br>
2011), 239. Rips and Woodward both use ‘concept’, where I think it likely that they should be using ‘perceptual <br>
attributive’, for attributives produced in perceptual systems.</div>
