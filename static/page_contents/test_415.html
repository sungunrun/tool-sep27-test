located in the occipital lobe at the lower backside of the brain. V1 serves many visual <br>
functions. Initially, it figures in mapping local features of the retinal image—orientations, <br>
spatial frequencies, features associated with lightness and color. For example, it responds <br>
initially to local, sharp changes in light intensity, yielding information that correlates with <br>
orientations—directions of segments of retinal edges or contours. (See Chapter 3, Visual <br>
Spatial Property and Relation Constancies.)<br>
<br>
Like all early visual areas, V1 is a site of horizontal feedback. Its different parts send <br>
signals to one another. It is also subject to feedback from other brain regions further <br>
along in the feed-forward sequence. V1 receives feedback from other areas of the occipi-<br>
tal lobe—V2, V3, V4, and from the temporal, parietal, and pre-frontal areas of the   <br>
cortex. Feedback from the parietal and pre-frontal lobes has its effects after initial feed-<br>
forward effects from LGN. Parietal and pre-frontal feedback effects occur largely after <br>
150–160 ms from stimulus onset. Of course, some feedback from previous visual occur-<br>
rences has already had its effects on processing before the onset of new feed-forward <br>
input from the retina. Feedback from V2, V3, and V4 to V1 starts almost immediately <br>
after stimulus onset. Fast feedback from MT/V5 is importantly linked with motion. See <br>
Figure 11.2.<br>
<br>
Feedback effects both from MT/V5, V2, V3, V4 and from more forward, parietal and <br>
pre-frontal areas of the brain enable V1 to participate in more complex visual process-<br>
ing than it does when it is first stimulated. The earlier recurrent processing feedback <br>
probably has significant effects in V1 by 57 ms. The later feedback, often associated with <br>
attention, tends to occur in the range 137–160 ms. Through feedback, boundary infor-<br>
mation expands beyond separate responses to local areas of the retinal image. <br>
Registrations of short edges in the retinal image are combined, in V1, into registrations <br>
of contours and shapes—and into rudimentary <i>perceptual</i> representations—before 100 ms.494 <br>
Feedback also enables V1 to shift from registering low spatial frequencies to registering <br>
high spatial frequencies.495 There are further changes discussed below. Discovery of the <br>
strength and variety of this feedback, and of the functional changes in V1 that derive <br>
from it, is central to the shift in the picture of perceptual processing that began in <br>
the 1990s.<br>
<br>
The forward progress of retinal signals divides after V1 between dorsal and ventral pro-<br>
cessing streams. Area V2 is divided not only into left and right hemispheres, but also into <br>
dorsal and ventral areas in each hemisphere. The dorsal/ventral anatomical division used <br>
to be taken as a division between dorsal signals’ contributing to determining <i>where</i> (either <br>
retinally or environmentally) a stimulus occurs and ventral signals’ contributing to deter-<br>
mining <i>what</i> stimulus is.496 A later view took the two streams to support two perceptual <br>
<i>systems</i> with functions of guiding action and specification, respectively.497 I think neither <br><br>
