contour registration and contour perception 89</div>
<br><br>
Contour groupings produced by the just-sketched computational operations are <br>
2-D. Neither the 2-D retinal-image projection of the environmental contours nor any <br>
other 2-D analog of those 3-D contours is an object of perception. Normally <i>no</i> en vir on-<br>
men tal contour has a length or shape predictable from properties of the corresponding <br>
retinal-image contour alone. There is almost never a contour in the physical environment <br>
that matches the <i>shape</i> of the contour in the retinal image. This is because in natural <br>
scenes there are almost no contours every segment of which lies entirely in a frontal-<br>
parallel plane. Absent 3-D information, there is no systematic correlation between <i>lengths</i> <br>
of contours in the retinal image and lengths of environment contours that cause the <br>
retinal-image contours. So the most basic properties of contours in the distal environ-<br>
ment—the properties of length and shape—are not matched. So there is no distal <br>
 environmental property that the computed registrations of contours can reasonably <br>
taken to represent. The only match that is systematic is to contours in the retinal image.82 <br>
Such matches alone cannot ground visual perception or perceptual constancies for <br>
attributes in the environment.<br>
<br>
I add this consideration to the basic point. A central feature of perception is that it is <br>
used in guiding a perceiver’s action in meeting perceivers’ needs or action targets. The 2-D <br>
operations that I described are very unlikely to enter directly into an account of guidance <br>
of practical interactions with the environment. They are preparatory to such guidance. <br>
Objects of visual perception are discriminable attributes and particulars that figure in <br>
accounts of the perceiver’s negotiations with the environment.83<br>
<br>
The 2-D contours in the image provide direction. They provide no information about <br>
ordinal depth or distance. Getting direction is cheap.84 All but the simplest organisms <br>
sense—informationally register—dominant stimulus direction. An animal does not need <br>
a lens to visually sense direction. If its system can differentiate strengths of stimuli on dif-<br>
ferent parts of its body, it can sense stimulus direction. Animals with a lens, but no percep-<br>
tual representation, can correlate a stimulus with a direction by being sensitive to the area <br>
of the receptors that respond most strongly to the proximal stimulus.<br>
<br>
As a general rule, one cannot perceptually <i>represent</i> direction unless one can represent <br>
ordinal depth or distance as well. One cannot perceive an environmental entity as being in <br>
a given direction—as distinguished from non-representationally register areas of the <br><br>

<b>FOOTNOTES</b><br>
<b>Cont FN</b>82 I think that nearly every vision scientist would agree that the first three stages of the computation of con-<br>
tour grouping that I described do not produce representations in a perceptual constancy. Few if any would count <br>
the fourth stage as different. That stage is, however, the first one that the scientists explicitly motivate by appeal to <br>
cross-domain statistics: the statistical match between registrations and contours in the distal environment. There <br>
remain infinitely many possible environmental contours that are compatible with the 2-D contours that are re gis-<br>
tered. Only one of these possible contours actually causes any given registration. Nothing in the registration, or in <br>
the laws for producing it, constitutes a commitment to one of these contour-types rather than the others. <br>
Perception makes such a commitment. The geometrical attributes of environmental contours are not and cannot <br>
be registered in a state that registers only 2-D information. Further, although cross-domain statistical matches are <br>
not invoked in the first three stages of the computation, even <i>those</i> stages are motivated by the thought that fea-<br>
tures in the retinal image that are registered derive from environmental attributes (edge segments, contours) that <br>
are important for the organism. The environment is <i>always</i> functionally relevant to sensory operations. The com-<br>
putation of a retinal edge segment occurs <i>because</i> sensing edge segments in the environment, as features of larger <br>
patterns, enables the individual to interact with the environment successfully.<br>

83 One must allow here for the special functions of proprioception. However, the body and its parts are occu-<br>
pants of 3-D space, a subject matter beyond the proximal stimuli that initiate proprioception. For my general <br>
framework for delimiting candidates for perceptual <i>representata</i>, see <i>Origins of Objectivity</i>, chapter 8.<br>
