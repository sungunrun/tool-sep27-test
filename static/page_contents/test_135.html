An occurring perceptual state is an exercise of a perceptual competence. To be a com-<br>
petence, the competence must be repeatable. That is, the same perceptual competence <br>
could have been exercised on another occasion. It could constitute the same type of <br>
response to different particular causes. If, on different occasions, the perceiver were pre-<br>
sented with two instances of the same type of entity through the same type of proximal <br>
stimulation, then (<i>modulo</i> noise or other interference, and holding background non-<br>
perceptual psychological states constant) the triggered perceptual states would instantiate <br>
the same types, since the same type of competencies would be exercised. In that way, per-<br>
ceptual competencies are freely repeatable or ability-general.<br>
<br>
A perceptual competence to represent a particular as being of a specific type is triggered <br>
by an instance of a specific proximal-stimulus type. The triggered perceptual competence <br>
selects a way that a particular is perceived to be. Such selection is perceptual attribution. <br>
Different proximal-stimulus types would have triggered exercise of other perceptual <br>
attributives, sometimes attributing the same attribute, or picking out the same particular, <br>
in different ways.<br>
<br>
I now connect these points to the actual practice of explanation in perceptual psych-<br>
ology. These repeatable aspects of perceptual states figure in two types of explanation.<br>
<br>
First, the formation of a type of perceptual state with repeatable discriminative aspects <br>
is explained as a product of the specific type of proximal stimulation that triggered it, <br>
together with antecedent psychological states and noise-like interference.<br>
<br>
That is the sort of causal explanation that perceptual psychology primarily engages in. <br>
The explanation explains the causal sequence in which a specific type of repeatable, dis-<br>
criminative perceptual state is triggered by an instance of a specific proximal-stimulus <br>
type. The repeatable discriminative representational state functions as a representational <br>
response to types in the distal environment. Since perception has the representational <br>
function of picking out or referring to particulars, the repeatable perceptual response to <br>
specific types of proximal stimulation (and ultimately to types in the distal environment), <br>
must be connected to the singling out of particulars.<br>
<br>
So the explanation explains the sequence from the occurrence of specific proximal-<br>
stimulus types to the exercise of specific types of competencies to discriminate particulars. <br>
The discriminated particulars are discriminated via competencies to representationally <br>
isolate specific environmental types that the particulars instantiate. So a perceptual state’s <br>
picking out particulars is connected to the exercise of a repeatable perceptual competence <br>
to discriminate specific environmental types (types such as shapes, motions, colors, sizes, <br>
relative positions, and so on). This connection of reference (picking out particulars) to rep-<br>
resentational discrimination of environmental types (attribution of types) must be in place <br>
if explanations in perceptual psychology are to be viable in anything like their present form.<br>
<br>
A discriminative perceptual competence that consists entirely in the competence to <br>
pick out a particular—a competence entirely individuated by the representational type <br>
that—is not specific enough by itself to count as a discriminative competence explained in <br>
perceptual psychology. For triggering such a competence does not vary with different <br>
types of proximal stimulation. Such a competence is present in every formation of every <br>
perceptual state.<br>
<br>
The second type of explanation in perceptual psychology is explanation of cases of <br>
accurate and inaccurate perceptual states. This second type incorporates the first. It adds <br>
descriptions of the distal environmental causal sources of proximal stimulation. Given the </div>
