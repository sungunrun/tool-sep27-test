It would be a mistake to claim that a perceptual state’s picking out a particular on the <br>
basis of proximal stimulation resides in non-perceptual repeatable abilities. The claim <br>
would leave the discrimination’s being <i>perceptual</i> unsupported and unexplained. If pick-<br>
ing out a particular is not explained in terms of perceptual competencies, the picking out <br>
is not perceptual.<br>
<br>
An alleged “bare” perceptual state would not representationally pick out anything at all. <br>
Something could be sensed and informationally registered. Then a sensory state would be <br>
caused by a particular. An instance of the sensory-state-type would function to be caused <br>
by an instance of a specific property or kind; and the sensory-state-type would function to <br>
co-vary with an attribute that the attribute-instance instantiates. We are assuming, how-<br>
ever, that sensing the particular is perceptual—a perceptual picking-out, a perceptual ref-<br>
erence. The idea that perceptual abilities can be exercised neat, can be applications of a <br>
bare that competence, is incompatible with the possibility of explaining perceptual dis-<br>
crim in ation of particulars. Such explanations are possible, because they are actual. They <br>
always connect specific types of proximal stimulation with specific competencies to per-<br>
cep tual ly attribute specific types of attributes. Exercise of a perceptual competence is never <br>
reference without attribution. It could not be.<br>
<br>
A variant on the foregoing train of reasoning appeals to perceptual constancies. The <br>
view that a perceptual state can be purely a referential application of a schematic that com-<br>
petence is incompatible with the fact that a perceptual state is necessarily embedded in <br>
one or more perceptual constancies. Perceptual constancies require that a perceptual state <br>
constitute one of many possible perceptual ways of representing the same particular or <br>
attribute depending on differences in proximal stimulation. Each way is causally deter-<br>
mined by a particular type of proximal stimulation (<i>modulo</i> background psychological <br>
conditions and noise-interference). Each way constitutes one of several possible perspec-<br>
tives (available in a perceptual repertoire) on a <i>representatum</i>. Perceptual attributives com-<br>
prise these perspectives. A pure that competence would not constitute a perspective on a <br>
<i>representatum</i>. It would not be specific to any particular type of proximal stimulation, or <br>
perceptually discriminable environmental attribute.<br>
<br>
There is a further type of explanation, in addition to the two already discussed, that <br>
(Not-AA1) would close off. This is explanation of the presence in a perceptual system of <br>
specific, repeatable, representational, discriminatory perceptual competencies. Such <br>
explanation appeals to patterns of environment–organism causal interaction over eons <br>
and in the learning history of individual perceivers. This sort of explanation differs from <br>
the explanation of the triggerings of types of perceptual state that are a primary concern of <br>
perceptual psychology. It explains the presence of types of representational competence in <br>
a perceptual repertoire, not triggering instances of such types by proximal stimulation. <br>
This type of explanation is <i>anti-individualist</i>. It is a type presupposed, not provided, by the <br>
science.141 It is a type of explanation that philosophy has traditionally and rightly insisted <br>
upon. Such explanation explains <i>what it is</i> for a state to have its representational nature or <br>
content, by invoking patterns of relations between the subject matter represented by the <br>
state and instances of the state-type. For perceptual representation, the relations are causal <br>
relations between the physical environment and sensory states.<br><br>
