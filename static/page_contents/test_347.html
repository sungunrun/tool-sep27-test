<b>Compositionality in Iconic Perceptual Representation371<br><br>
</div>
</b>The point that some parts of perceptually determined wholes are not identified (or in <br>
some cases, identifiable) independently of their relations to larger wholes is important for <br>
understanding the compositional structure of perceptual representation. A hierarchy of <br>
composition should not be taken to follow the <i>order of formation</i>. Composition principles <br>
govern a structural semantics, not a temporal order of formation.<br>
<br>
A simple model, <i>SM</i>, for the composition of the iconic representational content of a <br>
perceptual state would take <i>primitive</i> perceptual attributives to guide the picking out of <br>
smallest pixel-like perceived units. According to <i>SM</i>, representation of larger entities is <br>
built up by composition principles that follow the construction of representations of nat-<br>
ural wholes from the representation of smallest parts. Thus the model starts with percep-<br>
tual representation of smallest part, pixel-like bars or edge segments. It takes these to be <br>
put together to yield iconic representation of edges that are natural perceptual wholes. <br>
Composition of surface representation is built up from primitive representation of <br>
smallest perceivable surface-parts.<br>
<br>
<i>SM</i> represents a natural way of thinking. It is not correct. Compositionality holds in <br>
perceptual representation. It does not take the form proposed by <i>SM</i>. Smallest parts of <br>
natural units commonly <i>cannot</i> be perceptually represented except <i>as</i> parts of the units. <br>
Because perceptual representations of smallest parts of edges, surfaces, and so on, make <br>
reference to larger wholes of which they are parts, the compositional representational <br>
structure is not from micro to macro. Larger parts of an environmental edge are <i>in fact</i> <br>
composed of micro-parts. Pixel-like elements in the iconic representation do, in a sense, <br>
compose larger representations in an iconic presentation. But this composition is not rep-<br>
resentational composition. The representational contents of the smallest parts of iconic <br>
representation are derivative from the representational contents of larger parts. So the <br>
representational structure of a natural-unit perceptual representation as of edge, surface, <br>
surface-shape, 3-D volume shape, and body representation is not built up from primitive <br>
representations as of their smallest, perceptually discernible parts. Smallest parts are usu-<br>
ally irreducibly identified as parts of larger wholes. Attributives used in picking out the <br>
parts include the relational attributive, ___part of that1 F, where the referent of that1 F is a <br>
larger natural unit.<br>
<br>
Recall Fodorâ€™s characterization of linguistic compositionality with which we opened the <br>
section Some Ways Not to Think of Iconicity in Perception in this chapter:<br><br>
A . . . representation in L is syntactically compositional iff its syntactic analysis is ex haust-<br>
<br>
ive ly determined by the grammar of L together with the syntactic analyses of its lexical <br>
<br>
primitives. A . . . representation is semantically compositional in L iff its semantic in ter-<br>
<br>
pret ation is exhaustively determined by its syntax together with the semantic in ter pret-<br>
<br>
ations of its lexical primitives.<br><br>
This is a good gloss on compositionality in language. How is it paralleled in perception?<br><br>
