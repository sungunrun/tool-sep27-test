the first block moves from its partially occluded position to the right so that it is fully vis-<br>
ible. This block stops well right of the screen. The timing of the first block’s movement is <br>
consistent with its having been launched by the second block. In the habituation event, the <br>
children do not see the relation between the two blocks after the second block passes <br>
behind the screen and when the first block first moves.<br>
<br>
After habituation, the children are shown two further events in alternation. The events <br>
are like the habituation event except that the screen is removed. In one event, the second <br>
block moves on stage from left to right and makes contact with the first stationary block, <br>
at which point that block moves to the right. In the other event, the second block moves <br>
on stage from left to right, but stops short of the stationary block. After a short interval, <br>
the stationary block moves to the right. Children regularly look longer at the second type <br>
of event. They maintain habituation with respect to the first type. This pattern does not <br>
occur if habituation trials are omitted. Researchers infer that the no-contact event is unex-<br>
pected for the children (as it is for adults) and that the children represent mechanical <br>
caus ation in the habituation case and expect it after the screen is removed. It is established <br>
since Ball’s experiment that children perform in this way on partially occluded cases as <br>
early as they have been shown to form any causal impressions at all—currently, 3 months. <br>

Carey concludes,<br><br>
. . . even though contact between the two objects was not visible during the habituation <br>
<br>
trials, infants treat the contact test event as familiar based on the partially occluded <br>
<br>
ha bitu ation event. For this to be so, infants must form an inference or expectation about <br>
<br>
the unseen causal interaction occurring during habituation. Thus, as young as there is <br><br>
