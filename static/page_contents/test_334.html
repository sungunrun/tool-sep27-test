334 The Iconic Nature of Perception</div>

attributive representational content) iconic. A non-iconic belief, or a normal conventional <br>
sentence, or a non-iconic noun phrase in language, could represent the same particulars <br>
with the same attributes and in the same relations as an iconic representation. The repre-<br>
sentations would be psychologically different. They would correspond to different repre-<br>
sentational abilities. The modes of presentation would be different. However, they would <br>
share a generic representational form—say, noun-phrase-like or propositional. They <br>
would both involve application of attributives in a propositional or noun-phrase-like <br>
structure. This generic structure of a representation hinges on generic types of use and <br>
function, not on format. Since being iconic is not even being representational, the basic <br>
structure of representation, which is essentially representational, is independent of icon-<br>
icity. Referential applications are not in themselves iconic. Attribution is not in itself <br>
iconic either.<br><br>

<b>Part–Whole Representation in Pictures and Visual Perception363<br><br>
</div>
</b>Let us return to PP(1) and PP(2΄). They err in claiming that arbitrary combinations of <br>
picture parts are semantical units. They mistakenly allow picture parts that represent a <br>
part of an object and a part of the background to count as a representational unit. Pictures <br>
do exhibit a constrained structure of representing parts when they represent wholes.<br>
<br>
Consider this principle about picturing parts and wholes:<br><br>
PP(3) For every pictorial part Pp that represents a natural-unit edge, surface, surface <br>
<br>
shape, 3-D volume shape, or body, every part of Pp that represents anything repre-<br>
<br>
sents a part—or property of a part—of the edge, surface, surface shape, 3-D volume <br>
<br>
shape, or body, excepting parts—or properties of parts—of Pp that represent obstruc-<br>
<br>
tions to the visi bil ity of parts of Pp’s <i>representatum</i>.<br><br>
For 3-D volume shapes and bodies, sub-parts (and properties of sub-parts) that are per-<br>
ceived are only on the facing, visible sides. These sub-parts are, however, represented as parts <br>
of the 3-D volume shape or the body. The requirement of being unobstructed and fully <br>
 visible rules out clothing or other occlusions and rules out glare or highlights that prevent <br>
seeing parts of the main unit <i>representatum</i>. In PP(3), I suppress the point that parts of a <br>
picture do not strictly represent. It is aspects and arrangements of picture parts that represent.<br>
<br>
PP(3) could be expanded to include the sky as a surface-like entity whose parts are <br>
represented when the whole is represented. One could extend PP(3) to spatial parts of <br>
color expanses. I do not present it as fully satisfactory.<br>
<br>
What are the parts of a natural-unit entity that are represented whenever the whole <br>
natural-unit entity is represented? This is a delicate question. I believe that they are small-<br>
est depicted parts, and aggregates of such parts in which every smallest aggregate-part is <br>
contiguous with some other smallest aggregate-part.364 I discuss this answer below.<br><br>

364 For an account of aggregates, see T. Burge, ‘A Theory of Aggregates’, <i>Nous</i> 11 (1977), 97–117. The principle <br>
can allow the exception of single smallest depict-able parts that are depicted as part of a larger unit, but that are <br>
separated from the larger unit by some occlusion.</div>
