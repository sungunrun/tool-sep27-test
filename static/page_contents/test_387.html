parallel, as distinct from serial, search. By contrast, searches for conjunctions of features <br>
(for example, a blue <i>S</i>-shape) took linearly more time with increases of numbers of items <br>
to be searched. The fact that detection times increased linearly with display size in con-<br>
junction searches was taken to support postulating serial applications of attention on each <br>
item, to verify how its features are conjoined.<br>
<br>
A second key result centered on conjunction searches. In both target-present and <br>
target-absent trials, detection times showed linear increases with increases in number of <br>
display items. The slope for the increase in target-absent trials was approximately twice <br>
that for the target-present trials. The 2:1 slope ratio was taken to support the idea that <br>
serial search had a self-terminating character. Subjects scanned each item sequentially <br>
until either the target was found or every item in the display was searched and found not <br>
to be the target. The chances of finding a present target averaged to searching half of the <br>
display items. So the 2:1 ratio was to be expected.<br>
<br>
Beginning in 1982, the theory placed great weight on the empirically demonstrated fact <br>
that without attention, and even in certain cases in which the spotlight of attention <br>
includes too many items, subjects are prone to <i>illusory conjunctions</i>. In a typical experi-<br>
ment, subjects’ attention was drawn to areas of a display—say, two black numerals on <br>
either side of a group of three colored letter-shapes. Subjects were asked to focus on the <br>
two, separated black numerals and report them after the display disappeared. Subjects <br>
were given brief stimulus exposures, in the range of 100–200 ms. Reports of the black <br>
numerals were consistently accurate. Then subjects were asked to report combinations of <br>
features (red letter <i>S</i>, green letter <i>V</i>) between the two black numerals that they attended to. <br>
In such cases, illusory conjunctions were frequent. A subject might be shown a red <i>S</i> and a <br>
green <i>V</i>, but report a green <i>S</i> and a red <i>V</i>. Such illusory conjunctions were taken to indi-<br>
cate that reliable binding of features from different dimensions into a single visual object <br>
at a definite location required serial applications of attention.<br>
<br>
In 1988 Treisman proposed major revisions. The revisions functioned to accommodate <br>
evidence that seemed incompatible with the 1980–1988 theory. One revision responded to <br>
the fact that some feature searches, in addition to the conjunction searches, seemed to <br>
depend on serial application of attention. She held that in feature searches of large displays <br>
that involve relatively similar, hard-to-discriminate features, the display items must be <br>
divided into subgroups so that attention can apply serially to the subgroups.429 This idea <br>
constituted, of course, a rejection of the original sharp differentiation between pre-<br>
attentive and attentive processing. For both feature and conjunction searches could require <br>
attention. Treisman still postulated a difference between a processing stage in which atten-<br>
tion applied to the whole display (such a stage occurred in most feature searches), and a <br>
stage for conjunction searches and some feature searches that required sequential focusing <br>
attention on smaller groups, or even single items.<br>
<br>
There was a more dramatic revision. Treisman proposed that the initial registration of <br>
visual stimulation occurs on a master map of locations in which different dimensions of <br><br>
