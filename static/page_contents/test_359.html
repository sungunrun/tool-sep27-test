The Tractability of Iconic Attributional Complexity 359</div>
<br><br>
The representational content of the matrix that maps to <i>Big Surface</i> consists in perceptual <br>
competencies to attribute various aspects of particulars that occupy <i>Big Surface</i>. Relevant <br>
perceptual competencies are individuated partly by their connections to non-perceptual <br>
competencies—memories, anticipations, actions, reactions—that they interact with.<br>
<br>
For example, a matrix position might be associated with the content curved surface <br>
through a triggered perceptual competence to associate the position with curved surfaces. <br>
The same position might also be associated with the content curved surface of that <br>
globular-shaped body if it is part of a competence to anticipate further surfaces as one <br>
moves. The position associated with the 3-D volume shape attributive will also be associ-<br>
ated with anticipation of the shape’s maintaining integrity of boundaries over time. Then <br>
the matrix is associated with the content surface of that body and globular body.<br>
<br>
The extra cues and anticipations that yield 3-D volume-shape and body attributives <br>
make up natural clusters. When a viewer gets information that undermines enough cues <br>
or anticipations in a cluster, the associated attributive is cancelled. For example, one could <br>
correctly attribute a 3-D bulgy shape, but misperceive the shape as the shape of a body <br>
(one perceives smoke, but misperceives it as a body). The body attributive would be <br>
applied partly because of an anticipation that the 3-D entity will hold relatively rigid <br>
shape. If it were later perceived not to hold generic shape, the body attribution would be <br>
canceled in further perception of the smoke, while the correct 3-D volume-shape attribu-<br>
tion might be retained.375<br>
<br>
The attributives involved in 3-D volume-shape and body attribution mix with the part–<br>
whole and spatial mapping attributives in play with attributions of surfaces. Particulars <br>
perceived as parts of a surface that is perceived as the surface of a body are perceived as <br>
parts of the body.<br>
<br>
Sometimes in discussing iconic representation of bodies, it is said that body should be <br>
construed as a <i>label</i> on the iconic map, as if the attributive had a conventional-symbolic, <br>
not iconic, format. I think such talk mistaken. Representations of bodies in pictures and <br>
perception are iconic. The representational 2-D matrix does not bear a natural mapping <br>
into all 3-D aspects of the body. The content does not derive entirely from the mapping. <br>
No content derives from a natural iconic mapping alone. Content depends on competence <br>
and use.<br>
<br>
Perceptions of surfaces constrain assignments of locations to the 3-D volume shapes <br>
and bodies that the surfaces are perceived as surfaces of. An attribution of a location to a <br>
surface is accompanied by attribution of a more approximate location to the body (or a <br>
less confident assignment of a definite location to the body) that the surface is perceived as <br>
a surface of. The attribution of location to the body is constrained by the location of the <br>
facing surface. The former location includes the latter as a boundary. Attributions of 3-D <br>
volume shapes and sizes are usually more generic, less specific, less confident, regarding <br>
the shapes’ and bodies’ unseen sides.<br>
<br>
Spatial representation, including representation of surface-part–whole structure, goes <br>
beyond what the 2-D matrix itself determines. Always: iconicity is format, not itself con-<br>
tent. 2-D iconic format in itself spatially determines only direction. The natural mappings <br>
inherent in the 2-D matrix cannot determine even ordinal depth. Registration of direction <br><br>
