594 Perceptual Memory: Short-Term Systems</div>
<br><br>
capacity of working memory must ultimately be tested much more extensively on natural <br>
scenes. Despite these complexities, there is agreement that the capacity of working mem-<br>
ory is quite limited, at least for most tasks and for reasonably good resolution in memory <br>
representations. This limitation concerns <i>consciously accessible</i> short-term memory.<br>
<br>
Some have claimed that for a representation to get into visual working memory, it must <br>
be backed by endogenously controlled attention in the perception from which it derives. <br>
Such attention surely plays a role in allowing perceptual representations to be retained. <br>
However, perceptual representation can enter working memory even as attention is <br>
severely distracted.887<br>
<br>
New perceptual representation entering into working memory tends to overwrite <br>
already present representation. Since new perceptual material is normally continuously <br>
fed into working memory, and since working memory’s size limits are severe, it frequently <br>
empties its contents. Exceptions occur if subsequent perception is limited—for example if <br>
a perception is followed by darkness—, if contents remain relatively constant, and if con-<br>
tents are rehearsed.<br>
<br>
A simple picture of how visual perceptions are retained in working memory is that each <br>
perception yields a memory that is continually changed or written over as new perceptions <br>
come in. This picture is too simple. One function of working memory is to stabilize represen-<br>
tations from several perceptions that are retained and not over-written, so that the retained <br>
representations remain active despite new incoming sensory stimulation and perceptions.888<br>
<br>
I return to the selectivity involved in getting perceptual content through the bottleneck <br>
into working memory. In working memory, objects are normally represented together <br>
with their properties (shape, color, and so on). As indicated in Chapter 10, property repre-<br>
sentations may not be connected to one another, or accurately bound to objects, if atten-<br>
tion is severely distracted. Even in normal conditions, objects, their properties, and their <br>
locations are retained in working memory better than their spatial <i>relations</i> to one another. <br>
Simple relational spatial attributives like next to must be re-established in working mem-<br>
ory. Such re-establishment is probably effected by scans of objects in relations, starting <br>
with one focused-upon object and scanning to another.889<br>
<br>
As explained in Chapter 10, these findings were once mistakenly taken to show that the <br>
spatial relations represented as results of visual search are represented for the first time via <br>
attention in the search. In fact, representations in visual search often duplicate, in rational-<br>
access consciousness, prior perceptual representations of the spatial relations. Visual <br>
search can make those representations consciously accessible (“on demand”) in working <br>
memory, and perhaps long-term memory. Much of the complexity of primitive perceptual <br>
representation is lost to conscious accessibility, because of the bottleneck into working <br>
memory. Much of this complexity is nevertheless retained. It affects behavior—such as <br>
speed of response and forced-choice recognition.<br><br>
