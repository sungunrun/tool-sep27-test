490 Perceptual-Level Representation and Categorization</div>
<br><br>
In the second place, all perceptual attributives embed in compositional contexts. This is <br>
a consequence of their being part of representational structure. Mandelbaum’s explication <br>
here seems to make Fodor’s mistake of thinking that perceptual representations are not <br>
compositional and lack structure. (See Chapter 9, the section Some Ways Not to <br>
Think about Iconic Representation.)<br>
<br>
In the third place, the notion of ‘multiple mental systems’ is too vague to be helpful. <br>
Inclusion of memory and motor-processes on the list of systems whose availability would <br>
show a representation to be a concept betrays cursory thinking about connections between <br>
perception and memory or motor processes. All perceptual attributives are available to <br>
memory. All perceptual attributives can figure in causing and guiding motor processes. It <br>
would be empirically absurd to hold that animals with perception but without conception <br>
cannot retain anything in memory and cannot use perception in guiding action and other <br>
motor processes.<br>
<br>
The only element in the explication that carries any weight is counting concepts as <br>
building blocks in structures for reasoning and rational thought. Unfortunately, as will <br>
become clear, even this basis for diagnosing presence of concepts is not employed in an <br>
empirically skillful way.<br>
<br>
Mandelbaum reasons to the view that feed-forward processes in a visual perceptual sys-<br>
tem generate non-perceptual representations—concepts—as follows. The Potter-type cat-<br>
egor iza tion experiments (see Chapter 10, the section Two Lines of Empirical <br>
Criticism of Treisman’s Theory) evince that the perceptual system generates cat-<br>
egor iza tions in a fast, largely feed-forward way. It generates categorizations of kinds like <br>
<i>flower</i> and <i>box of vegetables</i> (and one might add, <i>truck</i>, <i>cleaning material</i>, <i>violin</i>, <i>picnic</i>, <br>
<i>boat</i>, <i>dog</i>, and <i>horse</i>). Meanings of words for these artifacts and kinds are expressed in <br>
language. Linguistic meanings are cognitive or conceptual, not perceptual. Further, repeat-<br>
ability, role in compositional structures, and availability to multiple mental systems show <br>
that the outputs of the feed-forward perceptual processes are concepts. Any attributive for <br>
these things cannot be perceptual. So the Potter experiments show that the fast generation <br>
of categorizing representations by the perceptual system is in fact generation of concepts.<br>
<br>
The reasoning depends on three oversights. One is moving too quickly from brevity of <br>
stimulus exposure to speed in processing.651 Potter’s subjects have considerable time to <br>
answer whether they have seen a given picture—certainly more than a second or two. That <br>
time allows for a lot of processing, including several types of processing. The role of <br>
speech—in instructions, in priming, and in subjects’ answers—shows that concepts are <br>
involved in subjects’ answering what categories of entities they saw. One cannot conclude <br>
that <i>conceptual</i> categorizations expressed in speech or in response to speech are the <br>
 cat egor iza tions produced at the fastest processing rates.<br><br>

<b>FOOTNOTES</b><br>
<b>FN</b>651 Mandelbaum writes, ‘. . . the cleanest way to examine perceptual processes is through stimulus presentation <br>
rates’: Mandelbaum, ‘Seeing and Conceptualizing: Modularity and the Shallow Contents of Perception’, section 4. <br>
In section 3, he reasons directly from brevity of stimulus exposure to speed of processing. These are serious <br>
errors. Brevity of exposure provides little direct insight into processing, and brevity of stimulus says little about <br>
length of processing time. Once the system is stimulated, it normally has lots of time to process the stimulus. <br>
Mandelbaum does cite other evidence, for example from Thorpe, that provides more specific ground to take the <br>
initial categorizations to be fast. But this citation is not accompanied by reflection on the compatibility of slower <br>
categorizations that are not produced by the visual perceptual system alone with the very brief stimulus ex pos-<br>
ures. These slower categorizations depend on the perception’s stimulating verbal judgments.</div>
