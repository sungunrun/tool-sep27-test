<b>Sources and Levels of Attention<br><br>
</div>
</b>Attention functions to select information that is likely to be relevant to practical matters. <br>
Certain stimulus types automatically attract exogenous attention, such as features that <br>
pop-out and abrupt onsets such as sudden motions. Both exogenous and endogenous <br>
attention are guided not only by present stimuli, but also by antecedent, practically rele-<br>
vant resources—especially affect and memories of action targets. Exogenous and en dogen-<br>
ous attention interact, so that each can produce a “drag” on the other—slowing it or <br>
partially diverting it—when they conflict.768<br>
<br>
Trying to spot a predator in a complex scene can cause attending, priori to stimuli, to cer-<br>
tain shapes and sizes. Attention, overt or covert, to task-targets figures in forming a priority <br>
map for future saccades, in speeding processing of representation of attributes associated with <br>
the target, and in speeding motor behavior—eye movements, pointing, grasping, avoiding.769<br>
<br>
Various types of memory can affect allocation of both exogenous and endogenous <br>
attention. For example, short-term memory involved in priming can bias attention to <br>
speed processing of recently perceived items. Memory of a reward history can yield antici-<br>
pations informed by attention. Long-term memory of a scene gist in which a searched-for <br>
object typically occurs can guide attention. Items held unconsciously in long-term mem-<br>
ory can affect allocation of exogenous attention over a half-year after reward learning. <br>
Like all attentional effects, effects deriving from memory can affect perceptual processing <br>
at various processing stages. Sources of memory effects can be as ordinary as priming or as <br>
grand as years-long memory.770<br>
<br>
Emotions can potentiate attention. Perception as of fearful faces causes fast, spatial-low-<br>
frequency visual responses that produce the effects of attention, even when the faces are <br><br>
