The Issue of Cognitive Penetration 677</div>

Thus, in a sense, conceptual attributives’ having uses that do not guide referential appli-<br>
cations constitutes an independence from the “here and now”. This sense is more subtle <br>
and more formal than traditional accounts in terms of distance from current proximal <br>
stimulation.<br>
<br>
The basic problem in Beck’s proposal is that distance from present stimulation does <br>
not in itself imply a level of representational capacity. In this context, cognitive repre-<br>
sentation is a higher-level type of representation than perception. The relation to time <br>
cannot <i>in itself</i> mark a difference in level. The distinction lies in the representational <br>
form and function of capacities. Capacities for conation, attention, memory, anticipa-<br>
tion, and learning are present in all known animals with perception. They evolved <br>
together. In most cases they did not evolve later than the types of perception that they <br>
serve. Such capacities are not <i>in themselves</i> higher-level or more knowledge-like. <br>
Perceptual-level species are not propositional. They operate entirely with perceptual <br>
attributives, with the possible exception of some perceptual-level conative states with <br>
attributives that are not more sophisticated than perceptual attributives. Operations <br>
involving representational states in these capacities are usually <i>more primitive</i> than some <br>
operations that produce perceptions. None are more sophisticated. No science that takes <br>
cognition to be representationally supra-perceptual should count all types of categoriza-<br>
tion, inter-modular processing, conation, attention, memory, learning, affect, anticipa-<br>
tion, or imagining, as cognition.<br>
<br>
The main issue for the science is to find a use for the term ‘cognitive’ that does not dis-<br>
tort thinking about the visual perceptual system and that allows clearer understanding of <br>
supra-perceptual-level representation.<br><br>

<b>The Issue of Cognitive Penetration<br><br>
</div>
</b>Philosophical discussions of cognitive penetration are nearly always cast in ways that <br>
obscure the issue that has been occupying us—understanding psychological kinds. Some <br>
discussions are almost fully disconnected from perceptual psychology. Even those that <br>
rest on good empirical observations are hampered by insufficient reflection on what cog-<br>
nition, penetration, perceptual systems, and perceptual-motor systems are.<br>
<br>
I begin with a carefully argued article by Fiona MacPherson that references empirical <br>
work. She states an often-cited account of sufficient conditions for cognitive penetration <br>
to occur:<br><br>
(MP) If it is possible for two subjects who have the same proximal stimulation and the <br>
<br>
same condition of their sensory organs to have different perceptual experiences (different <br>
<br>
in respect of phenomenal character and content) on account of the different states of <br>
<br>
their cognitive systems, then cognitive penetration is possible.<br><br>
MacPherson enters a caveat: non-standard causes by a cognitive state do not count as <br>
pene tra tion. She writes, ‘there have to be some links between the content of the cognitive <br>
state and the content of the perceptual state that is affected of a nature such that the effect <br>
on the content of the perceptual experience is made intelligible, or in some very minimal </div>
