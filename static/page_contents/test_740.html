reduce accuracy to biological success. Other exhibitions claim from the armchair that <br>
the scope of perceptual representation is limited to exactly what is relevant to action, or <br>
postulate non-science-based representational contents. Such approaches are misguided. <br>
In understanding representational contents of perception, one must examine discrimina-<br>
tive perceptual capacities of specific organisms through the lens of science. Although these <br>
capacities were molded by biological practicality, they depend on specific physical cap-<br>
abil ities of perceiving organisms and on niches in which they found themselves. Such <br>
cap abil ities can both outrun and undershoot what, from the armchair, might seem like a <br>
biological ideal. Science tests the perceptual discriminative capabilities of perceivers, case <br>
by case. Understanding perception requires following science in these matters.<br><br>

<b>Changes in the Science; Reading the Changes Philosophically<br><br>
</div>
</b>Perceptual psychology changes, of course. I emphasized two large changes since the 1990s. <br>
(See Chapter 10, the section Marr’s 2½-D Sketch; Chapter 11, the section Two <br>
Changes in Scientific Understanding of Perception-Formation.)<br>
<br>
One derives from discovery of the multi-directionality of the neural processing under-<br>
lying visual perceptual processing. Until the 1990s, visual processing was believed to be <br>
almost entirely feed-forward. It was thought that, after the initial feed-forward burst, <br>
higher-level cognition mixed with perception to produce 3-D volume shape representa-<br>
tion and categorization.<br>
<br>
Initial processing was regarded as local. Local processing was taken to become progres-<br>
sively more molar—combining separate local processing into processing that responded <br>
to increasingly wide areas of the visual field, until representations of surfaces were <br>
computed.<br>
<br>
In the 1990s, this picture was revised. Horizontal processing begins with the first regis-<br>
trations of local inputs in the first visual areas. Mainstream science still takes initial pro-<br>
cessing to be dominantly local and feed-forward. But horizontal processing right away <br>
widens the scope of the first local registrational effects. Further, feedback from higher vis-<br>
ual areas begins as soon as signals reach them. For example, as soon as processing in V1 is <br>
passed to V2, V2 sends signals to V1, as well as carrying out its own processing. So, even <br>
during the dominantly feed-forward processing in the initial burst, there is feedback. This <br>
initial dominantly feed-forward sweep occurs before there is input from memory, con-<br>
ation, or attention. The first attention arrives a little before 100 ms, after the fastest cat-<br>
egor iza tions. Multi-directionality continues after input from these other perceptual-level <br>
capacities enters into perceptual processing. For example, advanced visual areas such as IT <br>
feed signals, which have been supplemented by scene gist, memory, and attention, back to <br>
V1. Whereas V1 first carries out dominantly local processing, it is later remapped to take <br>
on more global functions, even supporting perceptual, as distinct from merely registra-<br>
tional, functions.<br>
<br>
The effect of these discoveries has been recognition that the visual system is both more <br>
complex and more integrated and larger in scope than it was thought to be.<br>
<br>
A second main change in the science is recognition of how far into the formation of <br>
perceptual states the dominantly feed-forward process goes. In the 1990s it was thought <br>
that that process ends with representation of surfaces oriented in 3-D space, with no 3-D </div>
