representation of objects bound to properties does not require any attention for the bind-<br>
ing. Representation of objects with properties as been shown to occur outside foveal <br>
regions, with distractors of attention. Such representation is formed very fast, in 60–120 <br>
ms and <i>may</i> occur with exposures of as little as 14–18 ms, certainly as little as 50 ms. These <br>
facts are elaborated in Chapter 11.<br>
<br>
Second, such representations can occur at multiple locations and in parallel. Such local-<br>
izations need not rely on attention, much less serial applications of attention.<br>
<br>
Third, multiply faceted particulars can be consciously represented on the short exposures.<br>
<br>
Fourth, relevant visual attributes of such particulars include hi-level categorizations, <br>
such as body of such and such shape, animal, face, and so on.<br>
<br>
Fifth, many of Treisman’s results hold only in special conditions—for example, condi-<br>
tions in which artificial property combinations (purple ‘L’ and green ‘T’) are presented.445 <br>
They do not hold for more natural particulars in natural scenes, if the particulars are <br>
 reasonably well spaced.<br>
<br>
I remarked that there were two lines of empirical work that focused on ultra-rapid per-<br>
ceptual processing of very brief stimuli.<br>
<br>
Mary Potter initiated the earliest of these lines. She did not focus on how fast attribu-<br>
tions are formed. She focused on short stimulus exposures that lead to attributions. Her <br>
work did not say much about speed of attributive-formation. However, it inspired work <br>
directly on that issue.<br>
<br>
Potter used an experimental paradigm in which subjects were shown pictures in rapid <br>
sequence (RSVP—rapid serial visual presentation). In 1969 she found that 16 pictures in <br>
a sequence were easily recognized in the test that followed the presentation if they had <br>
been presented at a rate of 1 second per picture. Pictures were of such scenes as a girl sit-<br>
ting in a boat. At shorter presentation times recognition accuracy declined. At 125 ms <br>
exposure, recognition was almost at chance. In 1976, Potter found that pictures could be <br>
easily remembered if they were presented for 90 to 120 ms, but followed not by a new pic-<br>
ture but by a “meaningless” mask, such as a collage of colored scraps, arranged arbitrarily. <br>
Thus the difficulty for recognition memory was not that the presentations at 90–120 ms <br>
were too short for individuals to represent and remember. The difficulty was that the pres-<br>
entation of the next picture cut off further processing for recognition memory in a way <br>
that the meaningless visual mask did not.446<br>
<br>
In 1975–1976, Potter tested recognition memory against detection or identification. In <br>
tests for identification, subjects were presented in advance with either a description, like <br>
‘boat’, or a boat-picture. Sometimes a rapidly presented sequence of 16 pictures contained <br>
a picture described or presented earlier. Sometimes it did not. Even when the target was <br>
previously labeled only with a word (‘boat’), detection was better than recognition mem-<br>
ory. Detection was only slightly better for targets <i>pictured</i> in advance than for those <br>
<i>described</i> in advance. At 120 ms exposure, recognition memory of a picture that was pre-<br>
ceded and followed by a “meaningless” mask, as opposed to a picture of some natural <br>
object, was as accurate as detection had been. In such cases, the subject did not need to be <br>
cued, in advance, what the target would be. However, if a target was cued in advance and <br><br>
