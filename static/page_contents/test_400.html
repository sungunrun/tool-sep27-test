spatial separation from distractor objects. Given insufficient spatial resolution, perceptual <br>
reliability shrinks quite generally—for both artificial and natural displays. For example, a <br>
different sort of animal or an upside-down face placed too close to the target degrades <br>
reliability. Significant errors set in, if relevant features are within 3 degrees of one another <br>
in the visual field, outside the foveal area.470 (Recall that one degree is about the width of a <br>
thumb at arm’s length.) Different types of perception-formation may require different <br>
degrees of separation. Attention is often needed to resolve crowding.<br>
<br>
However, with sufficient spatial separation of objects from distractors, under short <br>
stimulus exposure outside the foveal areas, visual systems can pre-attentively, rapidly, and <br>
reliably categorize objects. Under brief exposure, and outside foveal areas, individuals can <br>
pre-attentively categorize objects as fish-bodies, faces, vehicle-bodies, and so on.<br>
<br>
Interestingly, spacing had little effect on Treisman’s results regarding conjunction errors. <br>
The results held even if artificial objects were well-spaced, assuming sufficiently brief <br>
stimulus exposures. On the other hand, again, given good spacing, Treisman’s results do <br>
not hold for visual objects of natural importance to individual perceivers in natural <br>
scenes.471 Illusory conjunctions are uncommon for well-separated objects in natural <br>
scenes. Binding requires attention to natural objects primarily given poor spacing. Only in <br>
special cases, such as crowded scenes, is attention required for visually representing objects <br>
in natural scenes. Directing attention at crowded arrays yields better binding for artificial <br>
arrays <i>not</i> because of the need for attention for binding <i>per se</i>, but because attention yields <br>
resolution necessary for reliable perception of crowded, similar-looking attributes.472<br>
<br>
The important point here is that, for natural conditions of perception. problems in <br>
binding seem to be special cases of problems for perceptual resolution outside foveal areas <br>
of vision, Binding is not a problem that is solvable <i>only</i> through applications of attention.<br>
<br>
Further evidence counted against Evans and Treisman’s 2005 proposal. Recall that they <br>
maintained that only unbound features are represented pre-attentively and that serial <br>
attention applications are required to bind them. They noted that in rapid serial presenta-<br>
tion of pictures presented at intervals of 150–500 ms, there is severe degradation of an <br>
ability to represent the second picture in a sequence. They hypothesized that until the sys-<br>
tem had fully processed the first picture, using an application of attention to bind together <br>
its features, a second application of attention could not be used to categorize the second <br>
picture.473 The period during which the second object could not be identified had already <br>
been dubbed <i>the attentional blink</i>.474<br><br>
