<br><br>
A corollary of these approaches is increasing emphasis on ecologically valid <br>
 experimentation—experimentation that reproduces natural environmental conditions in <br>
which  perception operates. Such emphasis is growing field-wide, led by natural-scene-<br>
statistics approaches. These approaches stand out in integrating theory and experimentation <br>
with a steady focus on the environmental conditions that molded perceptual capacities.<br>
<br>
Most traditional experiments in perceptual psychology use simple, artificial, laboratory <br>
displays—a matrix of circles of various bright colors, for example. This practice focuses on <br>
what is intuitively salient to introspection—a residue of the old empiricist picture. The <br>
practice is attractive because it allows experimenters to control parameters. It has been <br>
thought to have the further advantage of presenting simple stimuli easily isolated as rele-<br>
vant to a task. Although this approach will and should continue to be used, its limitations <br>
have become increasingly apparent. The visual system did not evolve to deal with simple <br>
laboratory conditions. What is intuitively simple to the scientist may be difficult for the <br>
visual system. Simplicity comes with cue-impoverishment. Cues provided in the labora-<br>
tory may not be common in natural scenes.<br>
<br>
Repeatedly, lack of ecological validity has led to failures or limitations in theory. We saw <br>
this failure in early interpretations of the Kappa effect (Chapter 3, the section Visual <br>
Temporal Perceptual Constancies), in initial accounts of change detection <br>
(Chapter 10, the section Change Detection), in Treisman’s binding theory (Chapter 10, <br>
the section Two Lines of Empirical Criticism of Treisman’s Theory), and <br>
in accounts of trans-saccadic memory and working memory (Chapter 16).<br>
<br>
The effect of these shifts in the science will be to enrich understanding of perceptual <br>
processes. Given the evolutionary scale on which processing has developed, there has <br>
been time for perceptual systems to capitalize on an immense number of cues and rela-<br>
tionships. Perceptual systems have used the time well.<br><br>

<b>Perception: Form and Representational Content<br><br>
</div>
</b>One contribution of this project has been to take seriously the representational nature <br>
of perception—perceptual states’ representing particulars and attributes in the environment <br>
and perceptual states’ setting specific accuracy conditions. This central aspect of per-<br>
ception has been assumed, but under-studied. It is understandable that causal principles <br>
governing formation of perceptual states occupies the central focus of scientific investiga-<br>
tion. Nevertheless, the science’s main, self-set task is to explain how and under what con-<br>
ditions individuals perceive accurately when they do, and under what conditions illusions <br>
form. The science should be clearer about what it is to accurately or inaccurately perceive. <br>
It should delineate accuracy conditions and their representational form.<br>
<br>
One cause of failure, in studying perception, to focus on basic representational form, <br>
function, and capacities is the old empiricist model—engendering a tendency to think <br>
that once a perception is produced, its representational properties are evident to <br><br>
