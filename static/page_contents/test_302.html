agreement, or unconscious but non-compulsory coordinations.303 Rather, in the map <br>
example, natural, non-conventional relations have been selected by convention for repre-<br>
sentational use. As condition (3) states, natural mapping relations can be used in represen-<br>
tation—conventional or not. Such relations are non-representational, non-conventional <br>
relations. Perceptual representation is iconic, but has no conventional element at all.<br>
<br>
Conditions (3) and (3΄) constrain what counts as a natural mapping for representation <br>
and information registration. These conditions require the relevant natural mapping to <br>
figure in the representation or registration. I intend this “figuring” to involve both setting <br>
up the representation or registration and playing a role in how the representation or regis-<br>
tra tion operates in individual cases. Thus, in representation, the mapping figures in the <br>
mode of presentation of purported <i>representata</i>. For example, setting up the analogy <br>
between direction of the drawn line and the spatial ordering of the dots, on one hand, and <br>
the direction of the track and the spatial ordering of the stations, on the other, made pos-<br>
sible representing the light-rail system in the drawing. This analogy continues to figure in <br>
the way the system is presented and the way the map is understood.<br>
<br>
A consequence of the way in which conditions (3) and (3΄) constrain what counts as a <br>
natural mapping in representation or information registration is that an individual that <br>
uses an iconic representation or registration must be sensitive to or competent in using the <br>
natural mappings. The individual must respond to the mappings “naturally”—perhaps <br>
innately, perhaps through learning or adaptation. An individual—or representation/regis-<br>
tra tional system—must be sensitive, perhaps unconsciously, to the fact that relations <br>
among structural elements of the representation or registration are analogs of relations <br>
among structural elements of the represented or registered domain. The natural mapping <br>
must not only be, in itself, a non-representational, objective relation. It must be <i>natural for</i> <br>
users of the mapping—at least natural enough to allow relatively easy use. What is natural <br>
can vary with the user’s species and learning history. Note that this notion, natural for, is <br>
not part of the explication of natural in clauses (1) and (2), except in the case of mathemat-<br>
ics. It concerns only a condition (3) on a natural mapping’s being used in a psychology. <br>
A psychological competence for use <i>that helps determine representational content</i>—hence <br>
iconic representational content—is necessary for representation. Such a competence, even <br>
if acquired, must be, or must have become, natural for the representer.<br>
<br>
What of relations that are natural for one species, but not for others? What of a dog’s <br>
registering another dog’s tail’s wagging as information regarding relaxation or <br>
friendliness?304 Species-relative natural relations are natural relations. Biology is interested <br>
in the natural proclivities of specific species. If speed of tail-wagging mapped sys tem at ic-<br>
al ly into degree of relaxation, then two scales that are plausibly at root physical might also <br>
have a natural mapping, and not only for the dog, but for us. Information registration built <br>
upon such a mapping is iconic.<br>
<br>
In the most primitive cases of iconic representation or registration (cases of perception <br>
or sub-perceptual sensory registration), sensitivity to relevant mappings is sustained by <br>
antecedent causal molding. Natural correlations that are structural or mathematical can <br>
be <i>used</i> by individuals to yield iconic representation. Natural structural correlation <br><br>
