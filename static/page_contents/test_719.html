Empiricist Model of Perception and Cognition 719</div>

It may be worthwhile to reflect on different types of abstraction in perceptual process-<br>
ing. Doing so may help put a brake on vague, unarticulated reliance on the empiricist <br>
picture.<br>
<br>
Many types of similarity figure in grouping—forming more generic perceptual attribu-<br>
tives from more specific ones. One should not over-weigh phenomenologically <br>
 salient types.<br>
<br>
A visual system that represents not only a color shade at the most specific grain that it <br>
can discriminate, but also a color shade that includes that color shade and various other <br>
maximally specific color shades banded around it, may be construed as engaging in a kind <br>
of abstraction. Abstraction may hold together phenomenally similar maximally concrete <br>
color shades. But what makes the “abstraction” possible is the perceiver’s representational <br>
capacity to respond to the maximally specific color shades in the same way, in certain <br>
contexts or for certain purposes—not the phenomenal similarity of the shades. Perhaps <br>
grouping will not occur if colors are too dissimilar phenomenologically. Still, it is the <br>
grouping that forms the more inclusive, “abstract” attributive, not an operation sensitive <br>
only the phenomenological similarity.<br>
<br>
Another example is the relation between the types of surface orientation on either side <br>
of an occlusion that are grouped as similar enough for the system to represent the surfaces <br>
as part of a single partly occluded surface.1170 Such similarities of orientation are probably <br>
somewhat salient phenomenologically. But what drives the system to group the two <br>
surface-parts as parts of a single partly occluded surface is not phenomenology. There is <br>
nothing intuitively phenomenologically salient about the exact degree of similarity in <br>
orien ta tion that the system takes as necessary for grouping two items as parts of single <br>
surface. What drives the grouping is exposure to statistical relations in natural scenes that <br>
molded systems to group in that way.<br>
<br>
Other cases of grouping may not follow any phenomenologically intuitive sense of <br>
similarity at all. Grouping specific body-shapes as instances of generic shape is not phe-<br>
nomenologically intuitive for most people. The connectedness of an outer boundary is <br>
such a widely shared feature of shapes that many specific shapes that instantiate it seem <br>
wildly dissimilar to ordinary phenomenological intuition. Yet generic shape is one of the <br>
first shapes to be perceptually attributed. It anchors visual representation of body.<br>
<br>
Some groupings into equivalences comport even less well to empiricist ideas of image <br>
similarity. As noted, functional attributives are probably present in the visual system, cer-<br>
tainly present in perceptual-level actional systems. Consider an attributive for <i>food</i> in an <br>
omnivore. The variety of bodies and shapes grouped as edible bears no serious relation to <br>
intuitive image similarity. Perceptual or perceptual-level systems can learn similarity of <br>
function. Of course, one can regard any equivalence that forms a grouping for attribution <br>
as having similar instances. All instances of generic shape and of food are similar in having <br>
generic shape or in being food. <i>This</i> notion of similarity does not derive from intuitive <br>
reflection on image similarity.<br>
<br>
Equivalence groupings grounded in action and representational response should not be <br>
understood on the empiricist model of a mental act that neglects concrete aspects of an <br>
image in favor of aspects it shares phenomenally with other similar images. It should be <br><br>
