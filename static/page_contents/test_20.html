<b>Perceptual States as Sensory States<br><br>
</div>
</b>Perception is <i>sensory</i>. It is a certain capacity or competence for discrimination as a result <br>
of current stimulation of psychological states formed from causal impact.17 The dis crim in-<br>
ation is discrimination of causes. It need not, and commonly does not, discriminate them <br>
<i>as</i> causes. A sensory state discriminates entities that are among its causes. Since a percep-<br>
tual state is a type of sensory state, particular entities that it discriminates are its causes.<br>
<br>
Discriminating a <i>type</i> of cause is co-varying with and responding differentially to the <br>
type; the discrimination must have a function for the individual or for the sensory  system <br>
of which it is a part. Thus sensory states are information registrational states. Discriminating <br>
a <i>particular</i>—a non-repeatable—is responding to the causal impact of that particular, <br>
where the particular is of a type that is discriminated. I conjectured earlier that the larger <br>
functioning system within which these discriminations occur supports a cap acity for action.<br>
<br>
Sensory states in a sensory system—including a sensory perceptual system—are not <br>
generated by operations attributable to the individual. The states are produced in the <br>
 individual. Although the individual perceives, the individual does not produce the <br>
perceptions.<br>
<br>
Sensory states are generated from current stimulation. Here I intend ‘generated’ to <br>
exclude ‘propositionally inferred’. One might make propositional inferences caused by <br>
current stimulation. Neither the premises nor the conclusions of the inferences would be <br>
sensory states.<br>
<br>
A sensory state has a basic discriminatory function—to discriminate via causal sensi-<br>
tivity. Perceptual states discriminate via causal sensitivity. Unlike non-perceptual sensory <br>
states, they discriminate representationally. This difference will be discussed shortly. <br>
Perceptual beliefs also have this discriminatory function. Unlike sensory states, including <br>
perceptual states, perceptual beliefs have other functions as well—centrally, contributing <br>
capacities for propositional inference.<br>
<br>
Like perception, perceptual memory, perceptual anticipation, and perceptual imagining <br>
are <i>broadly</i> sensory. Their states are not sensings, or hence perceptual states. They are not <br>
generated from current sensory stimulation. <i>Perceptual memory</i> is memory that functions <br>
to retain perceptual contents. The contents of perceptual memory are perceptual con-<br>
tents—prominently, perceptual attributives—that function to retain contents of percep-<br>
tual states already generated. Perceptual memory represents its subject matter as in the <br>
past. <i>Perceptual anticipation</i> is usually mediately related to perception via perceptual <br>
memory. Like perceptual memory, it utilizes perceptual contents, but is not produced by <br>
current sensory stimulation. It does not function to discriminate causes of present sensory <br>
effects. Unlike perceptual memory, it functions to represent future, anticipated states or <br>
events. <i>Perceptual imagining</i> produces states with perceptual content. They are not caused <br>
by current sensory stimulation. Unlike perception, perceptual memory, and perceptual <br>
anticipation, states of perceptual imagining do not function to represent veridically.<br><br>
