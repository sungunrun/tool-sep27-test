In operating in a Bayesian fashion, updating mechanisms and motor commands are <br>
successful operations relative to objective norms. I focus on norms conceived as a level of <br>
statistical probability of meeting targets by motor action, given relevant input.<br>
<br>
<i>Operations</i> in the motor system in accord with Bayesian decision theory clearly do not <br>
constitute practical reasoning. Reasoning is a propositional sequence that functions to <br>
provide an explanatory justification of a conclusion. Relatively primitive action involves <br>
no such process. Perceptual memory, perceptual anticipation, target-setting states, motor <br>
commands, and efference copy are perceptual-level.724 These states are not propositional. <br>
None are more evolutionarily advanced than perceptual processing. As noted, target-<br>
setting states can be <i>caused</i> by propositional-level beliefs and intentions. I return to this <br>
point in Chapter 19. The sensorimotor processes are not, however, modeled by belief-<br>
intention psychology. Similarly, for adaptation and motor learning. Like perceptual learn-<br>
ing, they are not “higher-level”. Although sensorimotor operations are near optimal in <br>
meeting Bayesian principles, they are pre-rational.<br>
<br>
Of course, the Bayesian <i>principles</i>, though propositional, are not representational con-<br>
tents of any states in the pre-conceptual, perceptual-level actional system. State sequences <br>
in relatively primitive action are not of the right sort to be steps in reasoning. (See <br>
Chapter 4, the section Principles Governing Transitions Contrasted with <br>
Representational Contents).<br>
<br>
The sequences <i>presage</i> practical reasoning. There is an analog of a propositional-level <br>
intentional state, or other propositional goal-setting conative state. There is a further <br>
motor command that is an analog of an occurrent implementation of a propositional-level <br>
intention. Such states depend on specificational states that function to provide informa-<br>
tion about conditions under which the act is to be carried out. These latter states (percep-<br>
tions, perceptual memories, perceptual anticipations) are analogs of beliefs. Operation of <br>
motor commands under a cost–benefit weighting principles bears some analogy to <br>
reason ing about such a weighting.<br>
<br>
The means–end aspects of practical reasoning depend on a conversion into prop os-<br>
ition al form of pre-propositional psychological states. Such a process involves conceptual-<br>
ization of perceptual-level states. Becoming practically, means-end rational is initially a <br>
filling-out of pre-rational operations that are already (nearly) optimally Bayesian. Being <br>
practically, means–end rational depends on maintaining Bayesian operating principles in <br>
processing propositional states—beliefs and propositional-level intentions. The operating <br>
principles govern a system of explanation-justification that occurs <i>within</i> a proposition-<br>
level psychological system.<br>
<br>
Why does propositionality matter so much for practical rationality? Because practical <br>
reason gives explanatory justifications of why do such and such. Non-propositional states <br>
are not in a form that <i>could</i> answer an (in-principle) why-question with a because-answer. <br>
Processing according to Bayesian decision theory is a necessary condition for being <br>
means-end rational. It is not sufficient. Being rational requires having states that constitute <br>
explanatory justifications. In relatively primitive actional systems, the explanations and <br>
justifications are entirely the psychologists’. They do not occur in the systems themselves.<br><br>
