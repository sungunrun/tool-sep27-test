Initial registrations of sensory information are 2-D arrays. These registrations are not <br>
perceptual and do not have representational content. Vision science takes the layout of <br>
these registrations to bear important structural relations to the representational structure <br>
of perceptual representational content. Structural elements in perceptual representational <br>
content map to aspects of environmental entities in a 3-D natural scene. Perceptual repre-<br>
sentation capitalizes on this natural mapping. The iconic format of perceptual representa-<br>
tional content is fundamental. So far, our discussion has idealized away this format, <br>
entirely for expositional purposes. In Chapter 9, I discuss how format is an aspect of <br>
semantical structure. First, I reflect on further issues regarding the representational form <br>
of perceptual states.</div>
