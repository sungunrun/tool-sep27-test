Absence in Perception of Logical Constants 191</div>
<br><br>
An important constitutive feature of perception is that negations, conditionals, disjunc-<br>
tions, and quantifiers do not occur in perceptual representation. This section develops this <br>
point. I intend the discussion to provide background for future work on conditions under <br>
which not only these logical operators, but propositionality itself, emerge in representa-<br>
tional minds.<br>
<br>
Absence of negations, conditionals, disjunctions, and quantifiers derives from the rep-<br>
resentational function of perception. Perception functions to pick out particulars partly by <br>
characterizing them. It does so in a committal manner.<br>
<br>
A psychological mode is <i>committal</i> if success in realizing its representational function <br>
depends on the veridicality or non-veridicality of its representational content.193 Belief is <br>
committal because it fails its representational function if it is not true. Doubt is committal <br>
because it fails its representational function if it is true. Intention is committal because it <br>
fails if it does not make its content veridical. Memory, anticipation, representational fear are <br>
committal. Imagining, dreaming, supposing, as commonly construed, are non-committal.<br>
<br>
Perception is committal in that it fails to realize its representational function if it is not <br>
accurate—if its subject matter is not the specific way that it represents it to be. The func-<br>
tion of perception is to pick out particulars partly by characterizing them. The representa-<br>
tional form and content of perception constitutively depend on this representational <br>
function, and the underlying perceptual competencies to realize it.<br>
<br>
Since perceptual representational content is non-propositional—nominal—it cannot <br>
contain logical constants that are propositional connectives. There are no propositions <br>
to connect.<br>
<br>
What of operators like attributive-negation? Since perception functions committally to <br>
represent specific ways that causally relevant particulars are, it lacks a function commit-<br>
tally to represent how things are not. Negations abstract from the specific way that things <br>
are. They do not represent particulars as having specific attributes. Negations leave open <br>
what specific attributes particulars have. Perception’s commitment to a specific way that <br>
specific particulars are is incompatible with commitments to negations.<br>
<br>
Similarly, postulating non-propositional forms of disjunctions and conditionals is <br>
incompatible with the representational function of perception. For disjunctions and con-<br>
ditionals, are, like negation, non-committal with respect to their component contents. <br>
Perceptual states are committal regarding definite ways that particulars are.<br>
<br>
Take conditionals. Because conditionals are non-committal with respect to their ante-<br>
cedents and consequents, they are non-committal with respect to the only contents within <br>
them that could represent causally relevant particulars as they are. Perceptual states are <br>
constitutively committal with respect to such contents. A kindred point holds for <br>
disjunctions.<br>
<br>
Standard quantifiers generalize. They also map attributives into conditions in ability-<br>
general ways. Perception lacks either function. The representational function of perception <br>
is to referentially pick out concrete particulars that cause perceptual states to occur—by <br>
relying on such causation—partly by characterizing such particulars in ways that are sen-<br>
sorily discriminable. Generalization is not a representational function of perception. All <br>
perception’s ability-general competencies either guide specific reference to particulars, <br><br>
