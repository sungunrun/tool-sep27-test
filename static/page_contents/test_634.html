634 Perceptual Learning, Anticipation, Imagining</div>

Not only the old vestibulo-ocular reflex, but simple forms of saccadic eye movement <br>
and smooth-pursuit scanning occur in many animal systems, again down to the evolu-<br>
tionary level of insects.1001 Insects have not been tested for anticipatory representation, to <br>
my knowledge. Mammals are known to have mechanisms that probably have analogs in <br>
insects. Mammals’ saccadic and smooth-pursuit eye movements that track environmental <br>
motion involve perceptual-level anticipatory representation. Insects probably engage in <br>
similar anticipatory representation.<br>
<br>
All eye movement in mammals—including saccades and smooth pursuit—depends on <br>
weightings of a priority map that assigns a priority value to items represented in space. <br>
Shifts occur that reflect relations between prioritized and non-prioritized items.1002 <br>
Priorities depend on costs and benefits. Speed is a benefit; effort is a cost. Spotting and <br>
tracking moving entities are high priorities and often force eye movements, quite apart <br>
from an animal’s immediate targets.<br>
<br>
Saccades at speeds of 500 degrees per second can occur both automatically, according <br>
to an unconscious priority map, and in smooth pursuit, at least in mammals. Smooth pur-<br>
suit movements are slower (up to approximately 80 degrees per second in humans). Their <br>
function is to match the velocity of a moving object, maximizing foveation and minimiz-<br>
ing blur. As with saccades, smooth pursuit can occur either automatically or from cona-<br>
tive input.1003<br>
<br>
Many eye movements, of both saccadic and smooth-pursuit kinds, are standardly explained <br>
in terms of a combination of current representations of environmental motion and short-<br>
term anticipatory representations of motion/position in the immediate future. These anticipa-<br>
tory representations derive, of course, from inter-saccadic perceptual memories.<br>
<br>
A mechanism that causes anticipatory representations and requires only very short-<br>
term memory uses a copy of a current motor-command to generate anticipation of pos-<br>
ition of the moving entity in the immediate future. The copy of a command to move the <br>
eyes by a saccade or by smooth pursuit is combined with the short-term retention of a <br>
just-preceding perception to yield an anticipatory representation of the moving object as <br>
being in an immediate-future position.1004 This mechanism for producing anticipatory <br>
representation is an instance of efference copy, copying the motor command. The two <br>
types of eye movement are, of course, coordinated.1005<br>
<br>
A lot of eye movement that tracks motion can be explained in terms of efference copy. <br>
Accelerated motion and other phenomena are not as well explained that way. Other mech-<br>
anisms for producing perceptual anticipatory representation appear to supplement <br>
 efference copy.<br><br>
