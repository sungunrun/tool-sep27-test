Absence in Perception of Logical Constants 199</div>

Again, this thought would need support. Other things equal, if the anticipations are <br>
perceptual, the animal is best conceived as having competing anticipatory states. The pond <br>
anticipation and field anticipation compete. At a given time, they may have approximately <br>
equal motivating strengths. The animal is uncertain as between the two anticipatory <br>
states—each associated with some disposition to realize the anticipation. Its uncertainty <br>
concerns action and consequently which perceptual representation to realize. Other <br>
things equal, the animal’s psychology is best understood in terms of a mode of uncer-<br>
tainty. Neither of the perceptual anticipations is fully committal. Neither of the conative <br>
states potentially guided by the visual anticipations is fully committal. Competition <br>
between the anticipations and between the conative dispositions is resolved by perception <br>
of rain. Here again, one should not confuse mode and content.<br>
<br>
Points similar to those made regarding negation and disjunction apply to attributing <br>
conditionals to the representational contents of perceptual memory or perceptual antici-<br>
pation. Conditionals are naturally associated with representational states that concern <br>
causation. It is not well-established whether representation of causation occurs at the level <br>
of perception or, to the contrary, only at supra-perceptual levels. Let us assume, what I <br>
think likely, that some perceptual systems attribute causation. (See Chapter 12, the section <br>
Primitive Attribution of Mechanical Causation.)<br>
<br>
A perceptual anticipation of causation could rest on schematic perceptual memories. An <br>
animal has perceived many particular events as causing other particular events. It fails to <br>
retain memory of any of these events. It retains a schematic perceptual memory of Fs causing <br>
Gs. Built upon such memories is a perceptual anticipation of Fs causing Gs, on the condition <br>
that Fs occur. Perhaps there is no positive perceptual anticipation of Fs. One might think that <br>
the causal anticipation entails an anticipation of a conditional: if Fs occur, then Fs cause Gs.<br>
<br>
Again, other things equal, lacking special argument that there is a representational state <br>
in conditional form, it is best to account for the animal’s psychology in simpler terms. Is <br>
the conditional if Fs occur, then Fs cause Gs the content of a perceptual anticipation? Here <br>
again, distinguishing mode and content is important. Anticipation of a conditional is dis-<br>
tinct from conditional anticipation. If a schematic perceptual anticipation of an F occurs, <br>
it might trigger a schematic perceptual anticipation of a causing of a G by an F. The con-<br>
tents of such anticipations are not in the form of conditionals. A perceiver can have an <br>
indefinite, schematic memory as of Fs causing Gs. The memory can cause a conditional <br>
anticipatory state in certain conditions. A schematic anticipation of an F causing a G can <br>
be triggered if an anticipation of an F is triggered. Such an account requires no anticipa-<br>
tion in conditional form. The explanatory value of an anticipation of a causal relation that <br>
is not an anticipation of some particular events (causings, particular Fs) has not been <br>
established at the perceptual level. Finding conditionals in the content of the animal’s per-<br>
ceptual anticipation is no more plausible than finding negations or disjunctions. Perceptual <br>
anticipations are always of particulars, not conditionals.<br>
<br>
Of course, logical operations eventually emerge in the representational contents (psy-<br>
cho logic al kinds) of some animals’ representational states—at latest, in ours. My claim is <br>
that there is a level of representational psychology—in perception itself and in perceptual <br>
memory and perceptual anticipation—at which they do not occur.<br>
<br>
I have argued that quantifiers do not occur in perception, and that existential quantifi-<br>
cation does not occur in perceptual memory or perceptual anticipation. I argued the latter <br>
point before arguing that negation, disjunction, and conditionals do not occur in </div>
