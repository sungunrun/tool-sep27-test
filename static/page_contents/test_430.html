temporal ordering from coarse-grained, super-super-ordinate and super-ordinate cat egor-<br>
iza tion to finer-grained subordinate categorization, allowing for contextual, attentional, <br>
and training factors that shift normal ordering.545 For example, distinguishing features <br>
(as distinguished from positions) of two beagles is slower than categorizing them as <br>
animal-bodies.<br>
<br>
The main categories so far discussed are <i>body</i>, <i>face</i>, <i>animal-body</i>, <i>human-face</i>, <i>human</i>-<br>
<i>body</i>. There is a further vast array of specifically shaped bodies, grouped from a perceiver’s <br>
learning history: <i>airplane-body</i>, <i>car-body</i>, <i>dog</i>-<i>body</i>, <i>tool-with-handle-body</i>, <i>tree-body</i>, <br>
and so on.<br>
<br>
Again, I use ‘<i>body</i>’ to apply to generic bodies—not just to animal-bodies or human-<br>
bodies, as perceptual psychology often does.546 Recall that when I use a hyphen, as in <br>
 ‘car-body’, I intend a sub-class of bodies. The sub-class is visually grouped by shape and <br>
possibly characteristic motion. (See Chapter 4, the section Two Methodological <br>
Points About Natural-Kind and Functional Attributives.) Perceptual <br>
attributions and indicated kinds marked by hyphenated expressions indicate entities indi-<br>
viduated by shape, not as natural kinds or by function. Openness to the possibility that a <br>
kind is determined by an unperceived inner structure does not emerge in human children <br>
until age 3 or 4, and probably does not arise in non-human animals at all.547 Perception <br>
does not include such capacities. (See Chapter 4, the section Two Methodological <br>
Points About Natural-Kind and Functional Attributives.)<br>
<br>
<i>Functions</i> can be learned by perceivers and incorporated into the use-dispositions that <br>
can help give perceptual attributives their content. This fact lies behind the probable pres-<br>
ence in perceptual systems of functional categories like <i>food</i>, <i>predator</i>, <i>mate</i>. Less basic <br>
functions can be learned by perceivers without help from propositional attitudes and con-<br>
cepts. For example, birds and monkeys, who may or may not have propositional attitudes, <br>
can certainly learn uses for specific tools. Uses include actions. It is likely that perceptual <br>
capacities attribute actions and action targets. So perceptual learning of functions could <br>
well inform visual processing. So categorization of functional categories, detection of <br>
whose instances must be anchored in detection of shapes and sizes, can be differentiated <br>
from categorization of bodies by shape. The differentiation in content is grounded in <br>
anticipated or remembered function.<br>
<br>
I do not claim that this list of categorizing perceptual attributives is exhaustive. It cor-<br>
res ponds loosely with what is known. A full list will still be limited in comparison with the <br>
wide-open set of categorizations in <i>thought</i>. The variety of body-shape, body-types, and <br>
perhaps body-types with functions that can be grouped and learned by a perceiver still <br>
constitutes a large set of perceptual categorizing attributives.<br><br>
