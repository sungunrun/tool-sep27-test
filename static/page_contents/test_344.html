344 The Iconic Nature of Perception</div>

of the part of the shape that is occurrently seen. It is plausible that the perceptual state <br>
represents the surface as having further parts (in fact, unseen) and occluded shape-aspects <br>
(also, in fact, unseen) of the whole shape. Similarly, in perceiving a partly occluded branch, <br>
one perceives the branch as a whole and represents it as having a roughly continuous sur-<br>
face and surface shape behind the occlusion, even though one does not see the occluded <br>
parts of the branch’s surface or the occluded aspects of the whole surface shape and branch <br>
shape. Similarly, in perceiving an unoccluded body, a perceptual state represents the whole <br>
body and its having 3-D volume shape. There is no perception of the body’s backside <br>
surface-parts or the aspects of the shape beyond the body’s facing surface.<br>
<br>
What is the representational relation between the perceptual state and the unseen parts <br>
and unseen aspects of the whole particular and whole shape? The ‘the’ is miscast. One <br>
should not expect a single relation. Let us consider the three cases just mentioned.<br>
<br>
I assume that the disc is perceived as a surface, perhaps as a body as well. In tracking it <br>
behind occlusions, there is a perceptual memory as of the whole disc, including its whole <br>
surface shape, as it was perceived before it began to be occluded. When the disc is partly <br>
and then wholly occluded, there remains a memory that attributes and makes reference <br>
to the whole surface shape, and all those previously seen parts that are retained in the <br>
memory. The memory contains <i>de re</i> referential applications to the whole disc, the <br>
instance of the whole surface shape, and those remembered, now-occluded parts and <br>
shape-aspect-instances. The <i>perception</i> of the partly occluded disc also involves <i>de re</i> ref-<br>
erential applications not only to the still-visible parts, but also to the whole disc-surface, <br>
since it is still perceived, just by way of the visible parts. And the whole surface shape is <br>
both attributed and betokened. The perception lacks <i>de re</i> referential applications to the <br>
unseen aspects of the surface shapes and to unseen parts of the disc. It lacks relevant <br>
causal relations to them. The perception is, however, backed by one or another type of <br>
short-term memory, which may track them. Although occluded parts and occluded <br>
instances of the whole shape are not perceived or perceptually referred to, they may be <br>
perceptually attributed. In addition to the perceptual memory of the now-occluded parts <br>
and shape-aspects, the perceptual system is likely to form a perceptual anticipation of <br>
those parts and unseen shape-aspects. That is, the system anticipates <i>de re</i> perceptual ref-<br>
erence to them when the occlusion lapses.<br>
<br>
Take the second case. In perceiving a partly occluded branch, one perceives and has <br>
perceptual <i>de re</i> referential applications to the whole branch, its facing surface, and to <br>
instances of its 3-D volume shape and the facing-surface shape. Again, one perceives these <br>
wholes by perceiving the unoccluded parts. One’s perception also makes reference to the <br>
unoccluded parts and shape-aspects bounded by the occlusion. One does not perceive or <br>
have perceptual referential applications for the occluded parts or occluded shape-aspects. <br>
One lacks relevant causal connection to them. If one lacks a perceptual memory of the <br>
specific branch, one has no <i>de re</i> access to those parts or shape-aspects. Given cues from <br>
what is perceived, the perceptual system will form a schematic perceptual anticipation of <br>
the unseen parts and shape-aspects as they would appear if the occlusion lapsed. The per-<br>
ception might attribute unseen parts and shape-aspects that are congruent with what the <br>
perceptual anticipation schematically attributes.<br>
<br>
It is well not to overestimate how determinate or specific such perceptual attributions to <br>
unseen parts and unseen shape-aspects are likely to be. Sometimes, the attribution is <br>
probably quite generic. However, in principle, the attribution might be of a very specific </div>
