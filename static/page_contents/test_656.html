internally represents; there are restrictions upon the allocation of internally represented <br>
<br>
information to input processes.1063<br><br>
Some of Fodor’s writing opposes just the idea that input systems are open to ‘unlimited <br>
access [in forming perceptions] to higher-level expectations or beliefs’ (66). This modest <br>
claim is surely correct. It is empirically clear that not all germane beliefs and propositional <br>
expectations are inputs into the processing of perceptual states. The existence of illusions <br>
that persist even when one knows the facts shows that not all germane propositional atti-<br>
tudes figure in computations that yield perceptions. Most of Fodor’s formulations of the <br>
fifth mark allow for cognitive penetration. They take encapsulation to be a matter of degree.<br>
<br>
However, the main drift of Fodor’s discussion advanced a less modest view of encapsu-<br>
lation. Perceptual systems are compared to <i>reflexes</i> in their immunity to outside influence. <br>
Repeatedly, Fodor writes that he expects input systems to be largely or entirely immune <br>
from influence from beliefs and other propositional attitudes. He approves seeking <br>
“ri gid ly” encapsulated systems. He officially targets just the view that perception is so <br>
theory-laden as to be, in effect, theory. But he predicts that perception will be found not to <br>
be affected by beliefs or other propositional attitudes at all.1064<br>
<br>
Subsequent discussion of Fodor’s view of information encapsulation ignored the mod-<br>
est formulations and discussed the radical picture. On this picture, with a few qualifica-<br>
tions, input systems are immune to <i>any</i> outside non-pathological <i>causal</i> influence. <br>
Criticisms always target this picture.<br>
<br>
There is a further issue that Fodor’s discussion leaves unsharply formulated—the nature of <br>
the penetration that he denies. Fodor often denies some or all causal influence from outside a <br>
modular system. He was also centrally concerned with computational systems, and with input <br>
into computations. There is a distinction between just any non-pathological causal influence <br>
and causal influence via an input into a computation—an input governed by computational <br>
patterns identified in computational explanations. Nearly all current debate over cognitive <br>
penetration centers on the question of non-pathological causal influence <i>tout court</i>.<br>
<br>
Fodor slides between these two notions, usually centering on the former. He often loses <br>
focus on computation, or elides the distinction. He never elaborates incursion into compu-<br>
tations as the type of penetration that he denies. Still, computation lay in the background of <br>
his thinking. This type of causal influence—inclusion in the computations themselves—<br>
grounds one natural interpretation of some of his work. This type of violation of encapsula-<br>
tion would constitute input into the causal, computational process of an “input” system by a <br>
cognitive or conceptual intruder. A cognitive or conceptual representation would come <br>
from outside the limited set of perceptual or perceptual-level representational inputs that <br>
perceptual systems have been standardly taken to allow. Fodor certainly believed in such <br>
encapsulation. It is entailed by encapsulation from any non-pathological causal influence. <br>
I develop the less sweeping notion of encapsulation as we proceed.<br>
<br>
Fodor took information encapsulation as the central mark, the essence, of modu lar-<br>
ity.1065 He spends far more space discussing it than any other mark. It is not surprising that <br>
information encapsulation became the center of most disputes over modularity.<br><br>
