Episodic and Other <i>De Re</i> Long-Term Memory 621</div>

cases spans episodic memory and ordinary <i>de re</i> long-term memories. Here I discuss <br>
them as different types.<br>
<br>
I work with the idea that all the attributives in an episodic perceptual memory derive <br>
from one or more perceptual states that represent a single episode, where the memory <br>
attributives provide at least roughly the same perspective on the episode that the percep-<br>
tions’ attributives provided. I take such retention to require that it is not enough to retain <br>
only a generic attributive from a past perception. For example, that2 body with connected <br>
outer boundary is not specific enough. An attributive for a specific shape of the body, at a <br>
specific orientation and distance (or some close approximations), must be retained.<br>
<br>
In episodic memories involving cross-attribute attribution, not only the main identify-<br>
ing attributive for a focal particular, but also some attributives that characterize that par-<br>
ticular must be retained from the original perceptual states. Some of these further <br>
attributives must retain the betokening applications that they had in the perceptions. For <br>
example, in representing a body with a specific shape as a certain shade of red, an episodic <br>
memory must retain not only the referential application to the body. It must also retain <br>
some referential applications to the specific shape or color instances. Remembering the <br>
body as it was perceptually represented requires retaining perception of the body’s prop-<br>
erty instances, as well as the body itself.<br>
<br>
A conceptual episodic memory could retain characterizing attributives that conceptual-<br>
ize perceptual attributives. The conceptualization of a perceptual attributive is a concept <br>
that indicates the same attribute as the counterpart perceptual attributive does, and uses <br>
the perceptual attributive’s mode of presentation in the concept. In an episodic memory <br>
conceptualized from perception, some perceptual concepts must rely directly on the <br>
underlying perceptual attributives not only for their modes of presentation, but for some <br>
of their associated referential applications.<br>
<br>
Conceptual episodic memories can include conceptual attributives that have no coun-<br>
terpart perceptual attributive—that is, conceptual attributives that do not conceptualize <br>
a perceptual attributive. If the conceptual attributives are the same as ones used in per cep-<br>
tual ly based thinking about the perceived episode, they can occur in, and help constitute, a <br>
conceptual episodic memory. The applications of the conceptual attributives must retain <br>
some connection to the perceived episode.<br>
<br>
For example, one could have a conceptual episodic memory as of a specific x-ray <br>
machine by connecting the conceptual attributive x-ray machine with body and shape <br>
attributives that conceptualize perceptual attributives applied in the remembered episode. <br>
<i>Just</i> remembering a specific x-ray machine as an x-ray machine is a <i>de re</i> memory. But the <br>
attributive x-ray machine then does not connect to the perspective of any particular <br>
encounter with the x-ray machine. The memory would be episodic only if it represented <br>
the x-ray machine as it was perceptually represented on a specific occasion. There are epi-<br>
sodic conceptual memories that go back not to perception but to thought episodes. I do <br>
not discuss such cases here.<br>
<br>
<i>De re</i> long-term <i>non</i>-episodic memory contains referential applications that function to <br>
refer to particulars perceived in the past. Its attributives do not function to represent them <br>
specifically as they were perceptually represented at any particular past time.<br>
<br>
For example, a particular body could be represented in long-term memory via either an <br>
anaphoric referential application that depends on an original perception or, more usually, <br>
by a memory index file fed by one or more perceptions of the body. Its features could be </div>
