Two Lines of Empirical Criticism of Treisman’s Theory 395</div>
<br><br>
The idea that attention is needed to bind features to objects, consciously or uncon-<br>
sciously, is disconfirmed by the evidence. Cross-attribute attribution—including bind-<br>
ing—occurs outside the focus of spatial, feature-directed, and object-directed attention, <br>
and so does not depend on it.<br>
<br>
Further experiments tested the role of attention in ultra-rapid identifications of natural <br>
or artifactual kinds. Behavioral and electrophysiological tests were made for two images <br>
presented simultaneously. Human subjects are as fast and accurate in identifying targets in <br>
briefly presented pictures when presented with two pictures as when presented with <br>
one.453 This result suggested that limited high-level object representations can be gener-<br>
ated in parallel without attention.<br>
<br>
A stronger result emerged from experiments in which subjects detected an animal-<br>
body or a vehicle-body as they performed a different task known to demand considerable <br>
attention. Performance was not significantly degraded in such cases.454 If rapid cat egor iza-<br>
tion of a target required attention, there should be a marked performance degradation <br>
when subjects are presented with a concurrent, attention-demanding task. Lack of a sig-<br>
nificant difference in performance-level indicates that such categorization can occur in the <br>
absence or near absence of attention and does not depend on attention.455<br>
<br>
Similar results emerge in categorization of the gender of faces. Photographs of male and <br>
female faces were matched for low-level attributions such as color, size, and illumination. <br>
Obvious gender features such as hair style were eliminated. At exposures of 26 ms, subjects <br>
were approximately as accurate (well over 80% as accurate) and as fast at discriminating <br>
gender in a dual task experiment—with another task demanding attention—as they were <br>
in a single task experiment.456<br>
<br>
Remarkably, this result was extended to the <i>identification</i> of faces. That is, not just the <br>
gender of a face, but the particular identity of the face could be determined on stimulus <br>
exposures of 26 ms, in the absence or near absence of attention. It is known that process-<br>
ing face-relevant information is especially detailed and fast (80 ms or less), particularly in <br><br>

Some slowing of performance occurred when four scenes were presented simultaneously. The authors tried to <br>
accommodate this result in a parallel, as distinguished from serial, search model. There is later evidence that the <br>
slowing-of-performance depends not on lack of attention, but on crowding.<br>

455 Discussion of what cues and algorithms are used in ultra-rapid categorization, especially categorizations of <br>
animal-bodies, is ongoing. Some discussion is in computer vision. It aims at capturing and counting animals for <br>
environmental purposes. The psychological issues are complex. For sample literature, see F. Wichmann, J. Drewes, <br>

Attention’, <i>Journal of Vision</i> 4 (2004), 106–117. It is known that <i>some</i> performance degradation occurs when sub-<br>
jects carry out two tasks simultaneously. In the present case, the degradation was not taken to reflect competition <br>
for attentional resources. It could result from other factors, such as having to remember two sets of instructions, <br>
or prod uce two motor responses. Various controls buttressed the claim that attention was not a main factor in the <br>
slight differences in accuracy between the dual-task and single-task conditions.</div>
