First, Fodor and Pylyshyn wrote at a time when the best vision science took purely per-<br>
ceptual processing to end after early vision, short of categorization, and even short of 3-D <br>
attribution of shapes and spatial relations among them. (See the Chapters 10–11.) <br>
Pylyshyn liberalized the view slightly. He included, in early vision, perceptual representa-<br>
tion of 3-D volume shapes. He still excluded categorization. Fodor and Pylyshyn also <br>
wrote when perceptual processing <i>per se</i> was regarded, again in the best science, as “bot-<br>
tom-up.” They believed that the only non-bottom-up processes that affect perceptual pro-<br>
cessing, while it occurs, are recurrent processes within the main line of perceptual <br>
processing.<br>
<br>
Pylyshyn counted anticipation, imagining, and all or nearly all memory as cognitive. He <br>
may have taken attention commands to be cognitive. I reject these positions. They are <br>
connected with Pylyshyn’s failure to distinguish perceptual from conceptual attribution.<br>
<br>
Pylyshyn took non-pathological causal influence of cognition on early vision to be <br>
limit ed to two cases: (1) ‘allocations of attention to certain locations or certain properties <br>
<i>prior to</i> the operation of early vision’; and (2) ‘decisions involved in recognizing and iden-<br>
tifying patterns <i>after</i> the operation of early vision’.1139 I am not sure whether Pylyshyn <br>
thought that attention commands are cognitive, or whether he had in mind only cases in <br>
which background beliefs and intentions cause attention. Pylyshyn compared case (1) to <br>
selection of where to point one’s eyes—which clearly does not affect visual processing. He <br>
took attentional or other cognitive effects that occur outside early vision—such as cat egor-<br>
iza tion and object recognition—to be irrelevant to his thesis.<br>
<br>
Pylyshyn’s limitation claim is empirically mistaken. Pylyshyn understood early vision <br>
functionally—not in terms of the time of processing, or the anatomical area of processing. <br>
He understood early vision in terms of the types of representations processed. Perceptual <br>
processing of representations as of surface shape and 3-D volume shape, color, orien ta-<br>
tion, size, motion counted for him as early-vision processing. Although influence of <br>
endogenous covert attention occurs after the initial burst that forms first perceptions as of <br>
3-D volume shape and first body-categorizations, endogenous covert attention does affect <br>
perceptual processing of these types of representation.1140 It affects both the quality of <br>
visual representation, and what is represented and how, even in the first 100 ms after <br>
stimu lus onset. (See Chapter 15.) So Pylyshyn was wrong to hold that endogenous atten-<br>
tion does not affect perceptual processing, during processing of 3-D volume shapes. Since <br>
such influences are not cognitive, and since they are computationally integrated with vis-<br>
ual processing, I do not see that Pylyshyn’s mistake matters much.<br>
<br>
Opponents of Pylyshyn’s impenetrability claims naturally fix on his error. They also <br>
object to his assumption that early visual processing is largely bottom up, citing the dis-<br>
coveries of multiple forms of feedback. Much feedback affects processing of 3-D volume <br>
shape. Although such feedback comes from within the visual system, some of it comes <br>
from outside what Pylyshyn counted as early vision. Pylyshyn took categorization, mem-<br>
ory, and anticipation to be cognitive. Where any of these capacities affect refinements of <br><br>
