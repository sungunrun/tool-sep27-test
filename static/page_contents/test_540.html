540 Perceptual Attention</div>
<br><br>
Exactly why attention has these effects is not securely known. A leading psychophysical <br>
hypothesis is that attending to a location increases spatial segregation and temporal inte-<br>
gration. Because of trade-offs between segregation and integration and between spatial <br>
and temporal processing, enhancement of these aspects of perception leads to impairment <br>
of their contraries—spatial integration and temporal segregation. A hypothesis about the <br>
neural underpinning of these effects of covert exogenous spatial attention is as follows. In <br>
narrowing the spatial field of neurons, improving spatial resolution, the system facilitates <br>
activity of parvocellular neurons, in comparison with magnocellular neurons. Parvocellular <br>
neurons have longer response times that are likely to smear small temporal gaps between <br>
the flashes.753<br>
<br>
Many effects of covert spatial attention concern perception as of scalar properties. Both <br>
exogenous and endogenous attention make contrasts appear greater than they otherwise <br>
would.754 Exogenous covert spatial attention affects gap size, making a gap on the side of a <br>
rectangle look larger than it would if it were not attended. This effect is thought to result <br>
from remapping neural receptive fields. Perceived size of the gap is determined by per-<br>
ceived length of the line segments on the two sides of the gap. Attention increases spatial <br>
resolution, providing more precise estimates of the locations of the ends of the line seg-<br>
ments. The consequent reduction of estimate errors produced without attention, yields the <br>
appearance of a larger gap.755<br>
<br>
Spatial attention also intensifies the appearance of color saturation (though not hue).756 <br>
It increases the apparent size and speed of a moving object.757 All this work shows that <br>
attention affects the conscious “look” of what is perceived. It also shows that perceptual <br>
spatial attention sacrifices accuracy for some attributes, as a side effect of improving spa-<br>
tial resolution.<br>
<br>
To get a sense of the experiments’ method, consider an experiment that assesses the <br>
effect of covert exogenous spatial attention on the size of a moving object. Subjects fixated <br>
a central position. Then a cue was presented either 4 degrees left of fixation, 4 degrees <br>
right of fixation, or directly above fixation (neutral). After a short blank screen, subjects <br>
were shown for 82 ms two random dot stereograms (RDS), each moving left or right. <br>
Subjects were asked, in a forced-choice test, to determine the direction of the larger of the <br>
two RDSs. Whereas the focus of the subjects was on direction, the point of the experiment <br>
was to investigate the effect of attention on representation of size. (Incidentally, attention <br>
slightly improved the generally high accuracy of the directional judgments.) One of the <br><br>
