visual body categorization 93</div>
<br><br>
The main types of entities that have generic shape, but that are not bodies are gases, <br>
puddles of liquid, and piles of stuff, such as sand piles. Probably most attributions of <i>body</i> <br>
are triggered automatically when attributions of <i>generic shape</i> are triggered. But the visual <br>
system has cues that enable it to form an anticipation that an instance of <i>generic shape</i> is <br>
disposed to persist, without dissipating, as gases do, or scattering or flowing as liquids do, <br>
or scattering as piles of stuff do. For example, if a surface has ripples or reflects light in <br>
certain ways, a visual system can use stored associations between those properties and <br>
liquidity to anticipate a shape that too easily loses shape to be grouped with bodies. Or it <br>
could use stored associations between past shape maintenance and resting on a surface to <br>
anticipate that a clear-ish circular shape (in fact glass marble) resting on a surface with <br>
only a small part touching the surface would hold shape as a liquid would not. Visual sys-<br>
tems use multitudes of such past associations—some of them embedded in its perceptual-<br>
state-forming processors some in perceptual memory—to generate anticipations that can <br>
supplement generic-shape representations to attribute <i>body</i>.<br>
<br>
Competence to attribute <i>body</i> differs from competence to attribute corresponding <br>
shape primarily in that it is necessarily accompanied by perceptual anticipation of a ten-<br>
dency toward continuity of outer-boundary connectedness over time—in ways that dis-<br>
tinguish bodies from gases, liquids, and congeries of stuff. Having a capacity to anticipate <br>
and track continuity of connectedness is necessary for having a capacity to have a visual <br>
perceptual attributive for <i>body</i>.<br>
<br>
Of course, attribution of <i>body</i> can occur before temporal continuity of outer-boundary <br>
connectedness can be discerned. Since bodies with generic shape are probably more com-<br>
mon than gases, liquids, and piles of stuff with discernible generic shape, body attributions <br>
are probably usually triggered automatically, other things equal, by generic-shape attribu-<br>
tions. But when body attributions occur, a disposition to anticipate temporal continuity is <br>
also formed, or already present. If a bearer of a 3-D volume shape with a connected outer <br>
boundary were to be perceived as scattering, like a pile of sand, the body attribution would <br>
be shown mistaken and would probably not be retained in memory. The shape attribution <br>
would be accurate.<br>
<br>
In infants, body representation may initially require perceiving the relevant shapes in <br>
motion.94 Human adults do not need motion to perceptually represent bodies as such. The <br>
representational dependency that I want to highlight is that, in mammalian visual percep-<br>
tual systems, application of the generic shape attributive is a causally necessary condition <br>
for formation of an attribution of <i>body</i>, except in special cases, say, of super-fast perception-<br>
formation.95 It is widely assumed by vision scientists that body categorization is perceptual.<br>
<br>
Attribution of <i>body</i> under these simple conditions is incompatible with many trad-<br>
ition al philosophical theories. Many theories held that representing something as a body <br>
requires higher-level, cognitive knowledge. For example, they required that one have a <br>
primitive theory of mass or a capacity to represent a criterion for identity and difference <br>
among bodies.<br>
<br>
Even if one lays these theories aside and assumes that body representation is perceptual <br>
and needs no supra-perceptual-level supplement, most traditional philosophers required <br>
that representing body requires attribution of sortal shape. A sortal shape is the specific <br><br>
