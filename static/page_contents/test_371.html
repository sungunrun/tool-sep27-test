Three Limitative Views of First-Formed Perception 371</div>
<br><br>
visual-memory richness is illusion. The richness was supposed to reside entirely in the <br>
world itself. On other views, only our sense of <i>perceiving</i> a rich scene at any given time is <br>
an illusion. Psychological richness is supposed to derive from cumulative memory that <br>
puts together one impoverished perception after another. Richness was supposed to derive <br>
from cumulation in memory of sequences of attention-backed representation, not from <br>
perception itself.<br>
<br>
All these views took difficulties in change detection to show perceptions of a scene to be <br>
impoverished. Perception was claimed to lack representation of bodies and 3-D spatial <br>
properties, except perhaps in the few attended areas of the visual field. All such views held <br>
that perception needs attention-and memory supplements to yield any reasonably rich <br>
representation of the world.<br>
<br>
The third body of work is Anne Treisman’s account of binding. It was the most seriously <br>
developed view of the three. I later devote more space to it. Here I provide an overview.<br>
<br>
In 1980 Treisman noted that information regarding different types of environmental <br>
attributes—say, color and shape—is first processed in different neural pathways. She <br>
 reasoned that these information streams must rejoin to produce perceptual representa-<br>
tions of the object packages of shape, color, location that characterize normal perception. <br>
She called this putting-back-together ‘<i>binding</i>’. She maintained that binding is effected by <br>
attention. According to her theory, in the absence of attention, perception represents only <br>
unconjoined ranges of types of properties—colors or lightness gradients, shapes, orienta-<br>
tions of the shapes, motion, and so on. These properties are not arranged in a single spatial <br>
grid. They are not bound together in natural clusters. Experimentation showed that in the <br>
absence of attention, <i>illusory conjunctions</i> were often produced. That is, features of certain <br>
objects in a display would be mistakenly switched. A purple ‘S’ next to a yellow ‘T’ might be <br>
perceived as a yellow ‘S’ next to a purple ‘T’.<br>
<br>
Treisman proposed that in cases of illusory conjunctions, in brief presentations, with <br>
attention drawn to another part of a display, the shapes and colors could not be conjoined <br>
or bound. She maintained that, absent spatially oriented attention, properties in different <br>
ranges (for example, letter-shapes and colors) are not connected to one another, much less <br>
perceived as inhering in an object, or instantiated at a location.388 Others suggested that <br>
there may be no visual perception at all, absent directed attention.389<br>
<br>
According to Treisman’s view, binding color with shape into a representation of an <br>
entity with plural properties, binding either the properties or a perceptual object to a loca-<br>
tion, and determining spatial relations among such “bound” entities all depend on spatial <br>
attention. Only through such attention was perception supposed to represent anything in <br>
the environment beyond unbound property-instances. Prior to such aid, vision does not <br>
represent property-instances as located in space, or as properties of “objects”. On this view, <br>
prior to attention, the perceptual world is something like William James’s blooming, buzz-<br>
ing confusion.<br>
<br>
These three lines of thought—featuring the 2½-D sketch, responses to change detection, <br>
and responses to the binding problem—have been influential in both perceptual psych-<br>
ology and philosophy. They share the view that in the absence of infusions of attention and <br><br>
