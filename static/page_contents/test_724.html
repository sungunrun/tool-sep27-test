by smoking. Such an individual will surely lack a perceptual-level representation of a <br>
causal relation between smokings and deaths.<br>
<br>
Why? An important part of the answer has to do with the operations needed to become <br>
committed to there being the relevant causal relation. One must make inferences that are <br>
more complex and sophisticated than operations that occur in perception-formation. The <br>
starting points for such inferences are disparate. The confounds that must be ruled out are <br>
multi-form.1177<br>
<br>
To develop such intuitive points fruitfully, sharper delineations of what count as <br>
perceptual-level and supra-perceptual <i>operations</i> are needed. The smoking-dying case <br>
involves propositional-level, inference-to-the-best-explanation reasoning. Currently, large <br>
parts of psychology term almost any operation “reasoning” or “thinking”. This tendency <br>
works against better understanding of representational operations. Much that is counted <br>
reasoning is in fact perceptual-level operation. For example, perceptual-level rotational <br>
operations in imagination are often counted reasoning. (See Chapter 18.) Other types of <br>
problem solving—probably including Wolfgang Kohler’s ape’s finding a tool to reach a <br>
banana—involve only perceptual-level operations. Until sharper distinctions are drawn, a <br>
scientifically grounded distinction between perceptual-level and cognitive capacities will <br>
remain elusive.<br>
<br>
While there are almost surely non-propositional cognitive operations, one must be <br>
alive to a source of pressure against establishing such operations. The key element in a <br>
propositional structure is an attributive that does not, in all uses, function to guide refer-<br>
ence and that can play a main-verb-phrase-like representational role. (See Chapter 6, <br>
the section Perceptual Contents, Propositions, and Noun Phrases; <br>
Chapter 19, the section Uses and Misuses of the Term ‘Cognition’.) The <br>
induction-like operations involved in the smoking’s-causing-death cases—operations that <br>
seem not to be perceptual-level—almost surely involve attributives that do not function to <br>
guide per cep tual ly picking out a particular, in the past, present, future, or in imagining, <br>
and that can play a main-verb-phrase-like representational role. Such attributives contrib-<br>
ute to prop os ition al structure.1178<br>
<br>
Another class of candidates for cognitive-level or conceptual-level representation <br>
involves relational causal attributions in which one of the <i>relata</i> is perceivable and another <br>
is not perceivable in any circumstances. For example, in attributing internal non-<br>
representational sensory or conative states as causes of perceived actions, and in attribut-<br>
ing representational states (perceptions, beliefs, target-representing conative states) as <br><br>

<b>FN</b>1178 Like perceptual-level structure, propositional-level structure can be schematic. Many aggressive claims <br>
that a type of cognitive operation is non-propositional rest on overly restrictive conceptions of propositional <br>
structure—for example, as having always to have <i>content</i> analogous to that of asserted sentences. Conceptual <br>
competencies can have schematic propositional structure, and not be propositional. Schemas for relations <br>
between types of entities can have propositional structure without being propositions.</div>
