effect does not depend significantly on the eccentricity of the flashes—their distance <br>
toward the periphery from foveal fixation point—or on disc size.750<br>
<br>
An analogous result was obtained for the effect of covert exogenous spatial attention on <br>
the perception of the temporal order of successive brief events. Subjects fixated a central <br>
location and were asked to determine the temporal order of two disc onsets presented to <br>
one or the other side of fixation. Two spatially adjacent discs were presented in rapid suc-<br>
cession, at various stimulus-onset differences—17, 33, 50, and 83 ms. An exogenous cue <br>
preceding the two discs drew attention to one of two target locations. The discs were pre-<br>
sented either at the attended or the unattended location. Subjects were about 90% correct <br>
on the easiest, 83 ms separation. Even in these cases, they were slightly less accurate in the <br>
attended condition than the unattended condition. The degradation of accuracy on <br>
account of attention increased as the stimulus onsets grew closer together. Accuracy at <br>
17 ms difference in stimulus onset was between 60% and 70%, but 5–7% worse in the <br>
attended condition than in the unattended condition.751 The authors showed that <br>
en dogen ous covert spatial attention improved perception of temporal order under similar <br>
conditions. So the slower, more controlled endogenous attention could be used to correct <br>
the effects of the faster at-a-glance exogenous attention.<br>
<br>
A further result showed that covert exogenous spatial attention degraded perception of <br>
the direction of apparent motion of displayed shapes. Subjects fixated on a central location <br>
and were asked to determine whether a small rectangular shape, in the periphery, moved <br>
up or down. Before the shape was presented, a cue was presented. The cue was either valid <br>
(anticipating the location of the rectangle), invalid (placed on the opposite side of fixation <br>
from where the rectangle would appear), or neutral (multiple cues that cued all locations <br>
where the rectangle might appear). The shape was first presented for 33 ms. Then after <br>
various intervals (from 8 to 67 ms), the shape was presented for 33 ms at a location. 25 <br>
degrees either up or down from its initial position. Such presentations yield a perception <br>
as of motion of the rectangle. Subjects were asked whether the apparent motion was up or <br>
down. Accuracy ranged between 92% and 76% depending on the size of the interval <br>
between the rectangle presentations and the type of cue. The key finding was that attention <br>
decreased accuracy in comparison to invalid and neutral cues at all intervals.752<br><br>

demonstrations that the perceived duration of brief visual events is prolonged when exogenous spatial attention <br>
is attracted to their location: Y. Yeshurun and G. Marom, ‘Transient Spatial Attention and the Perceived Duration <br>
of Brief Visual Events’, <i>Visual Cognition</i> 16 (2008), 826–848. Some of this work has been challenged by A. Chica <br>
and R. Christie, ‘Spatial Attention Does Improve Temporal Integration’, <i>Attention, Perception, and Psychophysics</i> <br>
71 (2009), 273–280. They found better performance in the valid attended case than the invalid case. Even if this <br>
finding is correct, it does not challenge the claim that attention degrades accuracy in temporal resolution, com-<br>
pared to the neutral as distinguished from invalid conditions. In accord with the main line of work by Yeshurun <br>
and colleagues, the challengers found perception to be more accurate in the neutral unattended case than in the <br>
valid attended case—Yeshurun’s main result. Moreover, the Chica–Christie results have not been replicated. <br>
Results for invalid conditions are subject to significant confounds that the challengers do not disentangle. I am <br>
