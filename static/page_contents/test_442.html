442 Primitive Attribution of Causation, Agency</div>
<br><br>
Block sets out to criticize (quoted above) than the other two. It is not solidly established at <br>
what representational level attribution of numerosity begins. Moreover, attributions for <br>
numerosity are higher-level, in the sense that they cannot be applied to cases via percep-<br>
tion in a purely intra-attribute way—without an application base. To attribute numerosity <br>
on the basis of visual perception, one must attribute it via perceptual attributives for other <br>
attributes besides numerosity. For example, one must visually apply it via perceptual attri-<br>
bution as of an ensemble of outer-boundary-closed shapes, such as dots.<br>
<br>
Block discusses experiments that indicate that putative attributions of numerosity do <br>
not depend on certain <i>other</i> features of an array, such as texture, specific (distinguished <br>
from generic) shape of members of an ensemble, aggregate surface area of the array.563 <br>
These experiments defeat views that maintain that numerosity attribution in perception <br>
can be reduced to, or replaced by, perceptual attribution of these properties. They also <br>
defeat views that maintain that perceptual attributives for these specific features constitute <br>
the attribution base for attributions, through perception, of numerosity. I have assumed <br>
that the experiments show these facts. The experiments are not in question, although <br>
Block seems to think that I question them or that I am unaware of them. In fact, the <br>
ex peri ments tend to show what the application base of relevant attributions of numerosity <br>
<i>is.</i>  Numerosity here is attributed to aggregates of discrete objects, determined by closed <br>
outer boundaries—generic shape.564<br>
<br>
These experimental facts are not relevant to showing whether adaptation in itself prima <br>
facie shows that there are perceptual numerosity attributives. As far as the experiments <br>
show, the attributives for numerosity could be purely conceptual, with a perceptual appli-<br>
cation base for ensembles of closed-outer-boundary shapes. (The perceptual attributives <br>
in the application base have, I assume, conceptualizations of perceptual attributives for <br>
closed-outer-boundary shapes. But my point here does not depend on this assumption.) If <br>
attributives for ensembles of closed-outer-boundary shapes adapt, so will attributives for <br>
numerosity—regardless of whether numerosity attributives are perceptual.<br>
<br>
Here the second class of cases that I highlighted is relevant. One cannot know from the <br>
fact that an attributive adapts that it is perceptual—<i>or even that there is an underlying per-<br>
ceptual attributive that represents the same attribute that the adapting attributive represents</i>.<br>
<br>
In addition to mis-locating the point at issue, Block reports what the experiments show <br>
in a misleading way. He writes that they show that ‘number was the driving force of the <br>
adaptation’. This unfortunate locution elides the crucial distinction between the attribution <br><br>

<b>Cont FN</b>563 D. Burr and J. Ross, ‘A Visual Sense of Number’, <i>Current Biology</i> 18 (2008), 425–428; M. Fornaciai, <br>
G. Cicchini, and D. Burr, ‘Adaptation to Number Operates on Perceived Rather than Physical Numerosity’, <br>
<i>Cognition</i> 151 (2016), 63–67. I think that the authors are confused about a related matter. The title of the second <br>
article alludes to the finding that in comparison to an array of 20 unconnected dots, an array of 20 dots some of <br>
which are connected, adapts differently. The authors conclude that adaptation goes by way of perceived rather <br>
than physical numerosity. They simply assume that physical numerosity is the numerosity of the dots. They over-<br>
look the fact that “physical” numerosity is numerosity of an ensemble of physical units, and that there are many <br>
different physical units. The authors write as if <i>dot</i> is physically privileged over <i>entity with a continuous outer <br>
boundary</i>. Their result does not show any mismatch between perceptual numerosity and physical numerosity. It <br>
shows that the application base for numerosity applications that they test is perceptual attribution of outer-<br>
boundary connectedness (and of segmented objects with that shape), not on attributions of dots.<br>
564 There is evidence in both his articles (see note 561) that Block overlooks the fact that perceptual attribu-<br>
tives for <i>generic shape</i> form an application base for numerosity attributives. He may therefore think that attribu-<br>
tions of numerosity are not higher-level. I think that such a view can be shown empirically mistaken. Change the <br>
number of items with generic shape in visual numerosity experiments, in relevant ways, and attributions of <br>
numerosity will change. Perceiving items as having generic shape is central for attributions of numerosity via <br>
visual perception.</div>
