562 Perceptual Attention</div>
<br><br>
Classification is of ‘image patches or full images . . . into one of a number of categories’. <br>
Recognition is distinguishing between two classifications. Identification is association of <br>
a stimulus with a sub-category of a class (not a particular).799 None of the model’s uses <br>
of representational contents looks remotely conceptual or otherwise supra-perceptual. <br>
Only perceptual attributives are invoked. Modes are perceptual, memorial, conative, <br>
attentional.<br>
<br>
So both operations and contents are perceptual-level. There is not the slightest sugges-<br>
tion of operations or contents more sophisticated or representationally higher-level than <br>
those in perception, let alone a suggestion of propositional or conceptual capabilities (in <br>
my sense of ‘conceptual’). The computational model does not mention higher-level influ-<br>
ences on task or on initiation of attention. It does not deny that they can occur. But they <br>
play no role in this computational model of the executive control system. So the computa-<br>
tional model centers on the executive control system’s perceptual level of functioning and <br>
operation.<br>
<br>
The executive control system uses its direct connections to perception and the motor <br>
system to regulate relatively primitive action, including attention initiation.800 The execu-<br>
tive control system’s functioning and operating at the perceptual level does not, of course, <br>
exclude its also operating at higher levels.<br>
<br>
Both conscious and unconscious perception can be regulated. Unconscious en dogen-<br>
ous attention can guide motor action by directing unconscious visual perceptions to task-<br>
relevant targets. Similarly, the executive control system operates in task switching, again <br>
sometimes using unconscious visual perception.801 Unconscious visual perception is <br>
thought to be processed very fast. So conscious vision is a later upshot of visual processing. <br>
Supposing this to be so, it is not surprising that control of attention is sensitive to uncon-<br>
scious, as well as conscious, visual perception. Although executive control engages in <br>
recurrent processing, it operates here at the level of perceptual and relatively primitive <br>
motor representation.<br>
<br>
The executive control system interacts with the frontal eye fields (FEF), which support <br>
saccades. With trans-saccadic short-term memory it guides saccades. Deactivating FEF <br>
disrupts endogenously caused saccades (and has no effect on bottom-up stimulus <br>
detection).802 Removing influence of frontal cortex on visual cortex, through lesions and <br>
operations on the brain, prevents monkeys from flexibly switching attention to changing <br>
visual targets. It does not affect attention’s being exogenously grabbed by salient targets.803 <br><br>

<b>FN</b>799 The account of levels of categorization here is less specific than the one laid out in Chapter 11, the section <br>
Levels of Specificity in Perceptual Categorization. I conjecture that Tsotsos’s <i>identification</i> is <br>
either subordinate-level categorization or recognition-level categorization in my senses.<br>

cited in note 797, uses terms like ‘cognitive’ in broad ways that must be scrutinized to understand their relevance <br>
to the discussion here. These uses are not incompatible with my claim that the executive control system has a <br>
perceptual-level of operation and that most scientific work on its role in vision—and all detailed computational <br>
work that I know of—focuses on this level of operation.<br>
