is a cue for determining distance. Binocular disparity is a cue for determining ordinal <br>
depth. Both are binocular cues with their own mechanisms for forming perceptual repre-<br>
sentations. Each is backed by other cues for determining the relevant properties. One can <br>
perceptually attribute ordinal depth or distance either monocularly or binocularly. <br>
Suppose that one closes an eye. One foregoes one of the most basic mechanisms for deter-<br>
mining ordinal depth—binocular disparity. One can accurately attribute a given depth <br>
monocularly. But the depth is represented differently. In some cases, the depth can look <br>
different, phenomenologically. In all cases, there are psychological differences that affect <br>
representation—degree of confidence, speed in processing a perception’s interaction with <br>
other representations, and so on. The modes of presentation differ for the represented <br>
attribute. Normally, more properties (say, in the periphery of the eye to be closed) are <br>
represented binocularly than monocularly, but there are conditions in which this point <br>
does not hold. There is no reason to think that the differences reduce to differences in <br>
other represented properties besides depth.<br>
<br>
The general point is this. The visual system uses whatever information available to it to <br>
determine whatever environmental attribute that it represents. Often this information has <br>
its origins in the distal environment. In some of these cases, the information produces <br>
representation of other properties in determining representation of a given property. An <br>
example of such a case is scaling of distance in determining a constant size at different <br>
viewing distances (hence significantly different proximal stimuli deriving from a given <br>
size). But the visual system is not confined to information of this sort. Determining a <br>
property capitalizes on or compensates for aspects of the system’s equipment or internal <br>
mechanisms. So subjective and system-dependent information can be just as useful as <br>
representation of other, associated objective properties in determining distal properties <br>
that are represented. When more system-dependent information figures in representation, <br>
as it nearly always does, it yields differences in modes of presentation—in representational <br>
content, in psychological kind—in representing a given attribute. Such differences in <br>
information do not reduce to differences in associated properties that are also perceptually <br>
represented. Modes of presentation, hence perceptual attributives <i>for a given attribute</i>, <br>
vary in all perceptual systems. This fact is incompatible with minimalism. This first argu-<br>
ment implies that minimalism overlooks use of subjective, or system-dependent, sources <br>
of information in forming perceptual attributives.<br>
<br>
I turn to a second argument against minimalism. Color constancy is often character-<br>
ized as a capacity to represent given surface reflectances despite significant variations in <br>
surface illumination. (For simplicity, I assume that colors are reflectances; the example <br>
depends only on color’s not being an illusion.) On the minimalist view, in the more <br>
informative color-shade pairing, <i>one</i> canonical basic attributive that indicates and at tri-<br>
butes color-shade <i>c</i> is paired successively with each of two canonical attributives that indi-<br>
cate and attribute different illuminations. Combining color-shade and blue-lighting-<br>
 illumination attributives in attributing the color-shade yields a complex attributive that <br>
attributes color-shade <i>c</i> <i>in a different way</i> from the way in which it is at tri buted if the <br>
canonical color-shade attributive were combined with a canonical white-lighting-<br>
illumination attributive. The view is simple and tempting. But color constancy is more <br>
complex than minimalism recognizes.209<br><br>
