feedback loops to improve the action’s accuracy. There is time to correct for minor errors <br>
in an initial reaching trajectory so as to home in, via a new motor command, on the loca-<br>
tion and orientation of the target-object.<br>
<br>
Corrections as well as errors are thought to be recorded. Both kinds of records are used in <br>
setting initial parameters for improved execution of a subsequent action of a similar type. <br>
The feedback loops that are used to improve ongoing action are initiated by efference copies <br>
of the motor commands. These are short-term retentions of the initiations of specific types <br>
of action. They are used in perceptually anticipating action results, including sub-parts of a <br>
fuller action, such as a reach.705 These anticipations can guide continuations of the action.<br>
<br>
Minor errors in initial reaches are corrected through perceptual feedback. Not just <br>
errors, but changes in the initial spatial parameters involved in setting a target and a differ-<br>
ence vector, require remapping the target-object and the hand. Then, the difference vector <br>
itself is remapped. Individuals can make accurate reaches despite body rotations and eye <br>
movements that occur after the target is set. Efference copy from the motor commands <br>
that lead to rotations or eye movements supplement, and in some cases dominate, feed-<br>
back from proprioception in such remapping.706<br>
<br>
Individuals can make accurate reaches despite movement by the target after a difference <br>
vector is set.707 Visual tracking contributes to updating motor plans after a command <br>
is issued.<br>
<br>
Again, much processing between actional states and perceptual states is not consciously <br>
accessible. Subjects see a target-object on a screen, but are not allowed to see their arms or <br>
hands. Subjects fixate it and start reaching. Usually the object remains in place. In some <br>
cases, as subjects make a saccade to fixate the object, it moves by distances on the order of <br>
5 centimeters. Subjects compensate for the change and reach the target without difficulty. <br>
They do not recognize that the target changed positions or that they shifted their reach to <br>
accommodate the change.708<br><br>

An old, and still respected model of reaching—except at high speeds—postulates a first stage of reaching that is <br>
relatively fast. D. Elliott, S. Hansen, and M. Khan, ‘The Optimization of Speed, Accuracy, and Energy in Goal-<br>
Directed Aiming’, in D. Elliott and M. Khan eds., <i>Vision and Goal-Directed Movement</i>, (Champaign, Ill.: Human <br>
Kinetics, 2010). This first-stage reach usually undershoots the target. The discrepancy between the results of the <br>
first-stage reach and the target are perceptually recorded. A reassessment of the relation of hand and target is <br>
made, and a second visually directed stage homes in on the target to finish the reach at a slower speed. <br>
Opportunities for recalibration of relations between motor commands and perceptions of the target occur <br>
between first and second stages. Efference copy and perceptual anticipation figure in the fine-tuning re-<br>
calibrations. This two-stage picture of motor control has intriguing analogs in a two-stage navigation procedure <br>
through path-integration that reaches into the lower animal kingdom. Cf. Gallistel, <i>The Organization of Learning</i>, <br>
