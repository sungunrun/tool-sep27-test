Representations and Representational Contents 33</div>
<br><br>
the whole representational content of a perceptual state—or a belief state, or any other <br>
psy cho logic al state-instance—but also the constituent parts of the representational con-<br>
tent constitute psychological kinds or exercises of competencies.<br>
<br>
Many philosophers have grown accustomed to thinking of representational content as a <br>
special type of abstraction expressed by signs, words, symbols, or other vehicles of con-<br>
tent. This view is compatible with my view. However, it tends to be associated with a trad-<br>
ition of thinking about language that abstracts from the relation of language to psychology. <br>
I think that what this tradition produces is an idealization. The idealization must ul tim-<br>
ate ly be concretized. Linguistic contents are fundamentally psychological, in the sense that <br>
they are abstracted from psychological patterns underlying individuals’ language use. <br>
Regarding representational content in psychology, one must ask, ‘what is the relation <br>
between psychological representational content and <i>kinds</i> of psychological states, events, <br>
competencies, and processes?’ Psychology gives its explanations by reference to types or <br>
kinds of psychological states. The explanations’ focus is on representational kinds. <br>
Representational kinds are individuated by their modes (visual perception, belief, and so <br>
on) and their representational contents. There is no good ground to distinguish between <br>
the representational contents and psychological kinds—the kinds that together with <br>
modes constitute the psychological kinds referred to in the most basic types of psy cho-<br>
logic al explanations.<br>
<br>
A traditional philosophical question asks how a mind “gets in touch with” an abstract <br>
thing like a sense or a meaning. The question might be applied to representational content: <br>
How does a mind get in touch with something as abstract as a representational content? <br>
This is a pseudo-question.29 The question derives from the over-idealization of representa-<br>
tional content, just discussed. It derives from thinking of representational content as <br>
expressed by signs but somehow independent of minds. It betrays misunderstanding of <br>
what representational contents are.<br>
<br>
Since representational contents are kinds of psychological state, the question ‘how does <br>
an individual (or mind) make mental contact with the kinds of psychological state that it <br>
is in?’ has no clear sense. It does not raise a deep, dark philosophical problem. Being an <br>
individual with a mind or psychology just is being an individual whose states instantiate <br>
kinds of psychological states. Being a mind or a psychological system requires being in <br>
instances of psychological kinds. The question is no better than the question, ‘How does a <br>
water molecule get in touch with the kind of chemical bonding between hydrogen and <br>
oxygen that makes it a water molecule?’ Being a water molecule just is being an instance of <br>
a certain kind of chemical bonding between hydrogen and oxygen. Being an individual <br>
with representational mind just is having representational states of certain representa-<br>
tional kinds—which just is having states with certain representational contents, or states <br>
of certain representational kinds. Being a representational mind or a representational psy-<br>
chological system simply is to have systematically related states of specific representational <br>
kinds, which is to have systematically related states with specific representational contents.<br><br>

<b>FOOTNOTES</b><br>
<b>Cont FN</b>29 I think that analogous questions for sense and linguistic meaning are also pseudo-questions. Contrary to <br>
Frege’s Platonic conception of sense, which takes senses to exist completely independently of any minds, a rea-<br>
sonable notion of sense takes it to <i>be</i> possible representational thought content, which is a <i>kind</i> of mental cap-<br>
acity. See Burge, ‘Postscript to ‘Belief <i>De Re</i>’. I think that the various notions of meaning are rightly construed as <br>
various types of psycho-linguistic competence (or exercises of competence)—competence in use with at least <br>
minimal understanding. The point applies both to idiolectic and communal meaning.</div>
