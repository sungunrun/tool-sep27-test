temporal areas. Different areas tend to respond to different cues. Familiarity affects <br>
responses. Familiar faces trigger accurate responses even if faces are in a wide variety of <br>
orientations. So perceptual constancy under rotation is robust. For unfamiliar faces, <br>
responses vary more with orientations. Perceptual constancy across orientations is less <br>
robust and slower. Familiarity produces similar differences in categorization of other <br>
kinds—such as animal-bodies and vehicle-bodies. Perceptual processing of familiar faces, <br>
often involving long-term memory, though more complex, is more automatic.534 These <br>
points are applicable not only in the second phase, but also in the third phase.<br>
<br>
A third phase runs from 180 to 240 ms. It comprises massive parallel and feedback <br>
processing in the whole ventral stream and shows a significant increase in correlation with <br>
faces and other important categories. The psychological counterpart is a significant <br>
increase in accuracy. Some theorists believe that consciousness of category-instances <br>
emerges only at this third stage.535<br>
<br>
Similar phases of processing occur for other basic categories—for example, human-and <br>
animal-bodies, shaped bodies that function as food, mates, or predators—with slightly <br>
different timings. Endogenous attention supported by signals from frontal areas (frontal <br>
eye fields, FEF, parietal cortex, and orbital frontal cortex, OFC) applies mainly at about <br>
160 ms, during the second phase, perhaps slightly later than with faces. More primitive <br>
types of endogenous attention initiated in FEF can apply much earlier. (See Chapter 15, the <br>
section Timing of Visual Processing; Some Main Types of <br>
Representation.) Endogenous attention helps resolve visual indeterminacy in clut-<br>
tered scenes, especially by raising spatial frequency. Attention is not necessary for initial <br>
categorizations. It speeds, refines, and targets categorization, especially in hard-to-parse <br>
scenes. If entities are well-spaced and easily distinguished, neural feedback that supports <br>
attention is commonly unneeded.536<br>
<br>
Feedback from anatomically advanced areas derives not just from increase of spatial <br>
frequency information and application of attention. A special route runs from ana tom ic-<br>
al ly earliest areas via the dorsal stream to the mid-temporal area—especially the para-<br>
hippocampal cortex (PHC) and the retrosplenial cortex (RC). Signals on this route carry <br>
low-frequency spatial information. They support gist-like representation of spatial rela-<br>
tions of surfaces and bodies not categorized as kinds. These signals are fed onward to <br>
OFC, which sends information back to the infero-temporal cortex (IT). IT supports cat-<br>
egor iza tion. PHC and RC provide spatial-layout information relevant to navigation as well <br>
as categorization. Both are thought to figure in episodic long-term memory.<br>
<br>
Signals on this dorsal pathway move more quickly than those on the ventral pathway <br>
to IT. The anatomical difference in neural connections affects transmission speed. The <br><br>
