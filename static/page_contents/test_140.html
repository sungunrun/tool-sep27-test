11. A repeatable perceptual representational competence to pick out or refer to par-<br>
ticulars is a competence to <i>discriminate</i> particulars, in this sense: it is a competence to <br>
respond representationally in repeatable ways to some occurrent causes as distinguished <br>
from other occurrent causes that might in principle have been picked out but are not.147 <br>
(Premise)<br>
<br>
12. <i>Taken alone</i>, the perceptual repeatable representational competence to pick out <br>
(refer to) a particular in an occurrent cause-dependent way—the schematic representa-<br>
tional competence that—is not discriminatory in the relevant sense. That is not a re peat-<br>
able type of representational response that is relevantly discriminatory. For every <br>
particular in the occurrent causal chain leading to the occurrent perceptual state that <br>
might in principle have been picked out, but is not, is a potential that. There is nothing in <br>
the repeatable competence to pick out (refer to) particulars, <i>in itself</i>, that distinguishes the <br>
particulars in the occurrent causal chain that are actually picked out from other particu-<br>
lars that are not picked out, but might have been, given other supplementary competencies <br>
than the ones that the perceiver actually exercises.148 (Premise)<br>
<br>
13. So, in every perceptual state, there must be a further, more specific, repeatable rep-<br>
resentational perceptual competence to respond representationally to repeatable types—<br>
beyond the schematic that competence—that operates in perception, if a perceptual state <br>
is to exercise a competence to pick out (refer to) particulars in the relevant discriminatory <br>
way. The function of this further competence is to guide picking-out (referring)—discrim-<br>
inating by its type some cause in the chain of occurrent causes from other occurrent <br>
causes in the chain that are not perceived. (From 10., 11., and 12.)<br>
<br>
14. So, in every perceptual state, both an occurrent exercise of the picking-out (refer-<br>
ring) competence—a referential application that occurrently exercises the that compe-<br>
tence—and an exercise of the supplementary representational perceptual competence to <br>
discriminate types of particulars, must join in contributing to realizing a perceptual state’s <br>
overall representational competence for being veridical, of fulfilling the veridicality condi-<br>
tions that the perceptual state sets.149 (By 4., 6., 8., and 13.)<br>
<br>
15. Exercises of the two competencies contribute in this way: the perceptual state ful-<br>
fills the veridicality condition that it sets if and only if the exercise of the picking out <br><br>

<b>FOOTNOTES</b><br>
<b>Cont FN</b>147 The causal principle (step 5.) requires that a perceptual competence to pick out particulars picks out only <br>
causes of the perceptual state (more specifically, the relevant aspect of the perceptual state). The discrimination <br>
principle stated in this step requires that it discriminate perceived causes from occurrent causes that are not per-<br>
ceived. There are always such causes: various internal causes that lead to the perceptual state, the first registration <br>
of the proximal stimulus, the proximal stimulus itself, various events that occur in the causal chain between the <br>
perceived distal stimulus and the proximal stimulus, and causes of the perceived distal stimulus. The crux of the <br>
remainder of the argument is that this repeatable discrimination must be by way of certain specific types.<br>
A perceptual state functions to discriminate different occurrently perceived particulars from one another. This <br>
type of discrimination is always or nearly always in play, but does not figure in the present argument. See <br>
(AA1a) below.<br>
148 Similarly, a competence to repeatably respond representationally to the type <i>particular</i>  is not relevantly <br>
discriminatory. A repeatable competence that particular would not be relevantly discriminatory. All perceived <br>
and unperceived entities in occurrent causal chains that lead up to picking out a particular are particulars. All or <br>
most might have been picked-out particulars, given other <i>supplementary</i> competencies that a perceiver might <br>
have had and exercised. In other words, neither the that nor the that particular repeatable competence is dis-<br>
criminatory in the way required by step 11.<br>
149 So, the exercise of the picking-out (referring) competence cannot alone fulfill the veridicality condition set <br>
by a perceptual state. Or rather, that competence is a distinguishable aspect of a referential competence that <br>
ne ces sar ily includes both it and the guiding-discriminatory competence that associates particulars with types. <br>
Both are needed to fulfill the referring function and the function of fulfilling the accuracy condition set by the <br>
perceptual state.</div>
