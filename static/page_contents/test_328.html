328 The Iconic Nature of Perception</div>

surface without representing its size or color, or a road without representing its position or <br>
length. One chooses which properties to talk about. The packaging aspect of some types of <br>
perception is a <i>type</i> of iconicity. It is not essential to iconic representation. A color chit <br>
represents a color shade iconically. It normally represents no other properties. Packaging <br>
is not essential to perception. Certain pathological types of perception may represent <br>
color without representing any spatial attribute.<br>
<br>
Even though packaging is usual in iconic representation, loss of some units in the pack-<br>
age, or even de-packaging, does not in itself undermine the iconicity of a representation. <br>
A drawing could have its color removed and remain an iconic drawing. A map’s use of <br>
larger circles for larger cities could be discontinued, and the map would remain iconic. <br>
Review of the explication of iconicity near the beginning of this section supports this <br>
point. The point is also intuitive.<br>
<br>
Analogous points underlie the obvious fact that some aspects of a perceptual represen-<br>
tation may be better retained than others in perceptual memory, even though the memory <br>
is iconic, and even though the different aspects originally came in a “packaged” iconic <br>
perceptual representation.355 Even the complete loss to memory of some aspects of a <br>
packaged group of representations is compatible with the memory’s remaining iconic.356<br>
<br>
Iconic perceptual memory could, for example, retain iconic representation of shape <br>
better than color, or shape better than size. A visual perception normally represents size, <br>
3-D volume shape, color, orientation, location, surfacehood, bodihood, all as a package. <br><br>

<b>Cont FN</b>355 Green and Quilty-Dunn, in ‘What is an Object File?’, 7, state that PP(2) and the following principle are ‘the <br>
signature markers of iconic format’: (H) (for Holism) ‘Each part of the presentation represents multiple proper-<br>
ties at once, so that the representation does not have separate vehicles corresponding to separate properties and <br>
individuals’. Their exposition follows Fodor in conflating information registration and representation. Further, <br>
not all iconic representation represents multiple properties. Packaging is not a signature marker of iconic format <br>
(recall the color chit). It is problematic to claim that when multiple properties are represented in a package, the <br>
representation goes by way of vehicles, especially if picture parts are thought of as vehicles. If the properties or <br>
property-instances count as vehicles, then different vehicles, not one, effect representation of different properties: <br>
the color of the picture part represents the color; the shape of the part represents the shape (scaled appropri-<br>
ately); and so on. In perception, different aspects of a perceptual state represent different environmental  at tri butes, <br>
even though properties are represented in a package. So (H) is mistaken in various ways.<br>
Green and Quilty-Dunn argue that since perceptual working memory sometimes retains different properties <br>
to different degrees, perceptual working memory cannot conform to (H). They conclude that perceptual working <br>
memory is not iconic. They further infer that perceptual representation is not iconic either. Even apart from the <br>
mistakes in PP(2) and (H), this train of reasoning seems to me a <i>reductio</i> of their conception of iconicity and <br>
their conception of how representation takes place in pictures and perception. The fact that various properties <br>
are iconically represented in a package in perception does not begin to show that they cannot be remembered <br>
iconically to different degrees.<br>
356 It has been found that iconic perceptual working memory retains different features to different extents, as <br>
one would expect. Packaging is one factor in retention. Other factors bear on how well different representations <br>
of different attributes are retained in memory. Attention might affect different attributes differently. Facts about <br>
how different properties are registered differently in neural coding can also ground differential retention. <br>
Relationships among the types of properties retained can affect retention. For papers bearing on these issues, see <br>
