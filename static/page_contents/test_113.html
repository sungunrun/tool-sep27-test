(2) Perceptual states enter into causal relations, including when a perceptual state is <br>
<br>
computationally derived from antecedent states; and computations operate on the <br>
<br>
structures of perceptual representations.<br><br>
I add that computations operate on the structures of perceptual representational contents <br>
as well.<br>
<br>
Some philosophers have come, somewhat carelessly, to understand the language-of-<br>
thought hypothesis as simply the conjunction of (1) and (2). Although I accept (1) and (2), I <br>
believe that calling them any sort of language-of-thought hypothesis is two-ways mislead-<br>
ing. First, it is not the hypothesis that Fodor and followers have defended. Second, it is mis-<br>
leading to regard computation in perceptual psychology as operating on an in tern al <br>
<i>language</i>. Computations operate simply on representational contents and on their instances, <br>
representations. There is nothing distinctively language-like in perceptual systems, or in <br>
claims (1) and (2). Even talk of symbols in perceptual systems is, I think, misleading.<br>
<br>
The key claim of the language-of-thought (LOT) hypothesis concerns the exact nature <br>
or identity of the items on which computations operate. The key claim, the one that <br>
I reject, is:<br><br>
(LOT*) Elements in the structure of perceptual states are individuated syntactically, in <br>
<br>
a language-like way, and in a way that is independent of any specific representational <br>
<br>
properties; computations on perceptual states operate only on these elements.<br><br>
What does it mean to be individuated in a way that is independent of any specific repre-<br>
sentational properties? It means that that very same element, which is in fact representa-<br>
tional, could have failed to be representational, or could have represented something <br>
different from what it in fact represents, or could have represented whatever it represents <br>
in a different way. The idea is that what it is to be an element that computations among <br>
perceptual states operate upon does not depend in any way on the representational prop-<br>
erties that the element happens to have. What it is to be a “syntactic item” or “symbol” in a <br>
perceptual system is, according to (LOT*), independent of any of the specific representa-<br>
tional characteristics that the item in fact has. The same item could have “expressed” a <br>
different content, or none at all. So, on this view, since, strictly speaking, computations <br>
operate only on these syntactically individuated symbols, computations are actually syn-<br>
tactic. They do not have any specific representational import <i>in themselves</i>.<br>
<br>
In philosophy of language, it is disputed how words are individuated. Some philo-<br>
sophers hold that the very same word could have meant something different from what it <br>
does mean. Some hold that the thing that is a word might not have been a word at all. The <br>
word—say a mark that instantiates a range of exact shapes, or a specific grouping of <br>
sounds—could, in other possible circumstances, not have been a word. It might not have <br>
had any representational properties. (LOT*) takes elements on which computations in <br>
perceptual systems operate to be like that.<br>
<br>
The conjunction of (1), (2), and (LOT*) is the original language-of-thought hypothesis <br>
as applied to perceptual states. The crux of my disagreement is, again, (LOT*). It requires <br>
that to understand computation in perceptual systems, the science must postulate a layer <br>
of “syntactic” items that in themselves lack specific representational properties. This layer <br>
is taken to be present wherever perceptual states are present. Whenever perceptual states </div>
