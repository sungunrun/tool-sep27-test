190  Form and Semantics of Perceptual Contents</div>
<br><br>
I think that, to be scope-dominant, a referential application that functions to be to <br>
something perceived must be an application of an intra-attribute attribution, whether or <br>
not the relevant attributive is also cross-attribute attributed. In a <i>broad</i> sense, perceptual <br>
priority centers on categorization—intra-attribute attribution. Later I explicate a notion of <br>
categorization that is narrower and more traditional. (See Chapter 11, the section <br>
Categorization and Timing.)<br>
<br>
Recall from Chapter 2, the section The Three Fundamental Representational <br>
Constituents in Perceptual States, that representational content has three con-<br>
stitutive functions: (1) setting accuracy conditions (to be distinguished from the en vir on-<br>
mental conditions that make the “set” accuracy conditions accurate or inaccurate); <br>
(2) being a mode of presentation—a specific way in which a (purported) entity in the <br>
en vir on ment is represented; and (3) being a kind of psychological state or capacity cited in <br>
basic psychological explanations. Regarding (3): the representational content of a percep-<br>
tual state—including its occurrent referential applications, along with the state’s mode <br>
(say, visual perception), individuates—indeed <i>is</i>—the instantiated perceptual state in a <br>
given perceiver.192<br>
<br>
Scope is central to understanding function (3). Scope marks psychological focus or pri-<br>
ority. Psychological states with different foci or priorities are <i>necessarily</i> different states. So <br>
scope is part of the <i>constitutive</i> determination of psychological state kinds. Psychological <br>
priority does not necessarily affect what environmental conditions make a representa-<br>
tional content veridical, although it usually does affect them. So scope does not <i>necessarily</i> <br>
affect function (1) in a way that bears on what conditions make a psychological state <br>
veridical. I somewhat doubt that it is <i>necessary</i> that a scene looks, or is presented, differ-<br>
ently with a difference in scope. So scope may not <i>necessarily</i> affect function (2), although <br>
it usually does. The same particulars and attributes might in principle be presented via the <br>
same perceptual channels, yielding the same attributives applying to the same particulars, <br>
despite differences in priorities, although there are usually differences in attributives, and <br>
even particulars referred to, with differences of attention. Scope differences are, however, <br>
necessarily differences in psychological-state kinds.<br><br>

</b>The structure of perceptual representation so far outlined is that of a noun-phrase-like <br>
representational content. Contents of perceptual states are usually governed by multitudes <br>
of referential applications, which are exercises of a competence that functions to refer to <br>
particulars—to instances of attributes. Referential applications are exercises of schematic <br>
determiners—capacities to pick out particulars. They simultaneously apply perceptual <br>
attributives. Perceptual reference is accompanied and guided by attributions that function <br>
to characterize referred-to particulars. The attributions are massively parallel. They nor-<br>
mally occur in an iconic matrix, organized spatio-temporally and anchored egocentrically. <br>
I discuss this matrix in Chapters 8 and 9.<br><br>

occur in individual minds at particular times.</div>
