of <i>anger-expression</i>.560 If you disagree, take an attributive for <i>evil intention</i>. Few informed <br>
thinkers think that anyone literally perceives instances of evil or instances of intentions, <br>
although we all can see instances of expressions that in fact express evil intention. The <br>
moral concept evil and a concept for <i>intention</i>, as a contributor to a propositional state, are <br>
not formed in any perceptual system. So a complex attributive, evil intention, is concep-<br>
tual, with no perceptual counterpart that indicates exactly the same attribute. It (and <br>
anger-expression) do <i>not</i> conceptualize perceptual attributives. They are applied on the <br>
basis of perceptual attributives for spatial configurations. Such perceptual attributives <br>
comprise their application bases.<br>
<br>
Suppose that the perceptual attributive for a relevant spatial configuration undergoes <br>
adaptation. It is replaced by a slightly different attributive for a slightly different spatial <br>
grouping. Then applications of the conceptual attributive will also adapt. It will apply on <br>
the basis of the different spatial grouping. What was taken to be a borderline case of <br>
expression of evil intention will be taken firmly not to be an expression of evil intention, <br>
after an individual is shown multiple examples of clear-cut cases of expression of evil <br>
intention. The adaptation of the conceptual attributive <i>depends on</i> adaptation in an under-<br>
lying sensory or perceptual application base. Adaptation of a given attributive cannot <br>
show even that there is a perceptual attributive that attributes the same attribute as the <br>
adapting conceptual attributive, much less that the higher-level, adapting attributive is <br>
itself perceptual, or has a perceptual counterpart.<br>
<br>
To summarize: Adaptation is known to have a base in sensory or sensory-perceptual <br>
states. If an attributive shows adaptation, it is not thereby shown to be a perceptual attribu-<br>
tive. Two types of cases illustrate this fact. First, if a conceptual attributive conceptualizes a <br>
perceptual attributive—such as perceptual concepts for <i>red</i>, <i>face</i>, <i>anger-expression</i>—the <br>
perceptual concept will adapt if the underlying, conceptualized perceptual attributive adapts. <br>
(I assume here that anger-expressionc has a perceptual counterpart.) Second, there are <br>
cases in which a conceptual attributive does not conceptualize a perceptual attributive, <br>
and does not represent any attribute that a perceptual attributive represents, but is often <br>
applied contextually on the basis of perceptual attributives, which comprise its application <br>
base. Examples are conceptual attributives for <i>expression of anger</i> and <i>expresses an evil <br>
intention</i>. In these cases, as well, if the perceptual attributives on the basis of which the <br>
conceptual attributive is applied adapt, applications of the conceptual attributive adapt. I <br>
highlight the second type of case. If the first type were the only one, adaptation in applica-<br>
tions of an attributive could still <i>not</i> show that the attributive is perceptual. But one <i>could</i> <br>
conclude from adaptation in applications of an attributive that it represented the same <br>
attribute as a counterpart perceptual attributive, and was, if conceptual, simply a concep-<br>
tualization of a perceptual attributive. That would suffice to conclude that if there is an <br><br>

<b>FOOTNOTES</b><br>
<b>Cont FN</b>560 I use the hyphen notation here in the way explained in Chapter 3, the section Visual Spatial <br>
Perceptual Constancies and Visual Body Categorization. In taking a perceptual system to <br>
prod uce a perceptual attributive anger-expression, there is no assumption that the perceptual system has an <br>
attributive that indicates the psychological state <i>anger</i>. The attributive is a functional attributive. It applies to <br>
spatial configurations as having anticipated functional upshots, such as violent behavior. It contrasts with the <br>
perceptual attributive anger-configuration, which applies purely to a grouping of spatial configurations. The spa-<br>
tial con fig ur ations are properties of bodies or faces. A configuration is grouped <i>because</i> it tends to signal instan-<br>
tiation of the functional property <i>anger-expression</i>. But there is an attributive for <i>anger-configuration</i> that is <br>
purely spatial. Thus, in a given case, a perceptual system could be accurate in attributing <i>anger-configuration</i> and <br>
inaccurate in attributing <i>anger-expression</i>.</div>
