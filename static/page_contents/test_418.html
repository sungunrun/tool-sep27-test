and perhaps environmental).509 V1 registers retinal motion—directional changes in  retinal <br>
firing as well—in its first-pass, feed-forward processing of pre-perceptual registration of <br>
attributes in the retinal image. The extreme speed of MT’s response is also linked to MT’s <br>
role in enabling coherent, targeted representation of moving shapes and objects roughly <br>
positioned in environmental space.510<br>
<br>
Sitting, in the temporal lobe, near the top of the ventral hierarchy is the infero-temporal <br>
cortex (IT). IT and other temporal areas take input from the areas already mentioned, <br>
prominently from V4. They engage in feed-forward and feedback transactions with the <br>
parietal and pre-frontal areas. IT figures prominently in integrating dorsal and ventral <br>
information. It uses binocular disparity and other cues to sharpen depth perception. More <br>
distinctively, IT subserves processing representations of 3-D volume shape and location, <br>
and categorizational representation at various levels of abstraction. Representations can be <br>
as abstract as <i>animal-body</i> or <i>face</i> and as specific as <i>poodle-body</i>, and even the body-shape <br>
of a familiar dog-body. IT is strongly topographically organized, mapping actual environ-<br>
mental space, not merely retinal arrays. The spatial and categorizational representations <br>
that it supports exhibit rich perceptual constancies—invariances to changes in position, <br>
and location, size, rotation, color, and other constancies. These constancies integrate a <br>
larger number of cues than do constancies that occur earlier in feed-forward processing. <br>
For example, processes that determine constant shape from information about contours <br>
and borders are integrated with processes that determine constant shape from texture and <br>
from motion.511<br>
<br>
IT also contains a sub-area that responds to word forms. Since reading developed only <br>
in the last few thousand years, there is insufficient evolutionary time for this specialization <br>
to be innate. It is thought to be an area homologous to an area in monkey IT that allows <br>
learned specialization for frequently seen shapes. So the sub-area supports specialized <br>
shape attribution.512<br>
<br>
The temporal area contains other sub-areas (besides IT) that specialize, though not <br>
exclusively, in responses to faces. There are specializations in response to human body-<br>
parts, to places and scene-context (which provide familiar associations that improve the <br>
categorization of objects, through memory). There are also specializations for cross-modal <br><br>
