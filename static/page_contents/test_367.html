<b>First-Formed Perception: Its Richness <br><br>
and Autonomy<br><br>

</b>Had I been asked why they were, in that stark nudity . . . ‘interesting’, I fear I <br>
<br>
could have said nothing more to the point, even to my own questioning spirit, <br>
<br>
than ‘Well, you’ll see!’ By which of course I should have meant, ‘Well I shall <br>
<br>
see’—confident meanwhile . . . that interest would spring as soon as one should <br>
<br>
begin really to see <i>anything</i>.<br>

Henry James, Preface to <i>The Spoils of Poynton<br><br>
</i>In Part III, I sketch some of what is known about the nature and scope of visual perceptual <br>
processing—what sorts of perceptual attributives are formed, how and when they are <br>
formed, and what are the prospects for finding new types of perceptual attributives. In this <br>
chapter, I discuss important psychological views that, until twenty or so years ago, under-<br>
estimated how much of the world is represented in perception. I explain why these views <br>
were undermined within perceptual psychology. I then begin to sketch a positive view of <br>
the fastest-formed perceptions, a view that replaced the older views. In Chapter 11, I con-<br>
tinue in this descriptive vein, explaining in more depth the course of perceptual process-<br>
ing, as it is now understood, emphasizing its culmination in perceptual categorization. <br>
I discuss timing of the processing and types of categorizations known to be produced. So <br>
Chapter 11 and the end of this chapter sketch some of what is known about first-formed <br>
perceptions, which constitute first forms of mind in us. Chapter 11 also outlines roles of <br>
attention and perceptual memory in later stages of perceptual categorization. Chapter 12 <br>
discusses methodological issues regarding how attributives are certified to be perceptual—<br>
produced by the perceptual system. It also discusses two cases—attributives for agency <br>
and causation—to illustrate considerations, pro and con, that bear on whether the most <br>
basic attributives for these attributes are perceptual or supra-perceptual. Like Chapter 11, <br>
Chapter 12 provides factual background for understanding relations between perception <br>
and satellite competencies like perceptual memory, on one hand, and supra-perceptual <br>
capacities, on the other. These are central topics in Part IV. So the largely descriptive <br>
account of perceptual processing in Part III is meant to provide factual groundwork for <br>
philosophical understanding of relations between perception and higher representational <br>
powers in Part IV.<br><br>
