<br><br>
In no way do I deny the import of non-visual perceptual modalities. Different mo dal-<br>
ities are always connected in perceivers that have more than one. Connections are causally <br>
reciprocal. Perceptual-state formation in one modality can always be influenced by input <br>
from another. Inter-modal influence occurs among touch, hearing, proprioception, and <br>
vision. To limit complexity, I touch on inter-modal relations only glancingly.<br>
<br>
My work on vision should not be seen as detracting from work on other modalities, or <br>
on inter-modal influences, in any way. It should be seen as a possible resource in under-<br>
standing inter-modal relations and relations between visual perception and perception in <br>
other modalities.<br>
<br>
My focus on perception is also not to be construed as minimizing the huge role of <br>
action and reaction in forming and using perceptual capacities. Perception evolved, fun-<br>
damentally, not because it was accurate, but because it contributed to action and reaction <br>
that, in turn, contributed to fitness for reproduction. Action evolved before perception <br>
did. Its flexibility and precision is enhanced by perception. Perception’s main use is in <br>
guiding action. Its guidance is, of course, sensitive to feedback from states that set action’s <br>
targets and feedback from action itself.<br>
<br>
Perception and <i>perceptual-level conative states</i>—psychological states that function to <br>
produce action guided by perception—form a large psychological system, the perceptual-<br>
motor system. I discuss such conation in Chapter 14. I am acutely aware that more could <br>
be said to provide a more balanced account of interaction between perception and con-<br>
ation. I believe, however, that perception is the main, or entire, source of representational <br>
resources in primitive conation. That is, perceptual attributives that guide conation are the <br>
main or entire repertoire of representation in primitive action. In primates, action guid-<br>
ance derives primarily from vision and proprioception. Again, visual capacities do not <br>
operate alone, or independently of relations to other perceptual modalities. Still, visual <br>
perception looms large enough and constitutes such a formidably complex phenomenon <br>
that I do not apologize for focusing on it.<br><br>

<b>Principal Aims of the Book<br><br>
</div>
</b>Five principal aims inform this book.<br>
<br>
The first is to develop a detailed understanding of the core fundamental representa-<br>
tional features of visual perception. In Part I of the book, Chapters 2–3, I explain what <br>
I mean by perception. I distinguish it from non-perceptual sensing. I discuss the key mark <br>
of perception—perceptual constancies. In Part II, Chapters 4–9, I develop the form, func-<br>
tion, and content of visual perception. I set out the primary types of representation in <br>
 visual perception—such as referring (or picking-out) types and attributive (or character-<br>
izing) types. I explain ways in which these types of representation combine to yield a <br>
 representational form—on an analogy to logical forms of propositional representation. <br>
I discuss the basic semantics of visual perception. Finally, I explicate and explore the <br>
iconic, map-like or picture-like format of visual perception.<br>
<br>
The second aim, pursued in Part III, Chapters 10–12, is to situate these structures in <br>
the processing of visual perceptual representations. I sketch some of what is known about <br>
how the representational forms discussed in Part II are caused to occur by stimulation. <br>
I discuss processing and time courses of some of the main types of visual perceptual </div>
