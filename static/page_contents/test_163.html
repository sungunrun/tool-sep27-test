shape-instance changes over time, and vice-versa. Moreover, the body’s surface can be <br>
tracked over time even as it changes shape or size, at least slightly, and even as it gains or <br>
loses some particles that make it up. Different trans-temporal psychological tracking <br>
capacities are associated with each of the five momentarily coinciding entities (spatial <br>
region, size-instance, shape-instance, surface, aggregate of particles). The material instances <br>
of size, shape, and surface are differentiated in a visual perceptual system, as well as in <br>
physics—tracked by different psychological mechanisms. In sum, physics recognizes <br>
instances of color, size, and shape. The old metaphysical issue is defunct.<br>
<br>
The main psychological, as distinct from metaphysical, point is that different causal <br>
chains—for example, between color-lightness and shape-size, from body to visual sensors, <br>
must be distinguished to account for the physical effects processed by the perceptual sys-<br>
tem. Different causal chains in a stimulus array at a given time (say, the one that produces <br>
color and lightness attributions, and the one that produces size-shape-surface attribu-<br>
tions) are processed by different mechanisms. Aspects of a given causal chain (say, one <br>
from material points on the facing surface) are grouped and tracked in different ways (as a <br>
surface, as a shape-instance, as a size-instance) by the perceptual system’s perceptual for-<br>
mation processes. Those formation processes connect with different tracking mechanisms <br>
and ultimately with different uses for action and reaction. The perceptual system responds <br>
not just to the particular body, body-parts, surfaces, and surface-parts that <i>bear</i> the <br>
 properties, but to concrete, particular conditions or aspects of the body, its parts, and its <br>
surfaces—conditions that are instances of the body’s properties. The perceptual system <br>
picks out bodies, surfaces, body-parts, and surface-parts only by bearing causal relations <br>
both to them and to tropes of their features—primarily spatial features—by which they <br>
are perceived.<br>
<br>
A second point is, I think, less central. It still carries some weight. There appear to be <br>
cases in which particulars are perceived, but perceptual systems do not attribute <i>bearers</i> of <br>
feature-like properties—only the feature-like properties. In such cases, it is plausible that <br>
perceivers perceive only tropes, not bearers. Consideration of the cases will bring us, by a <br>
different route, to the point discussed in the foregoing paragraphs—that even in cases in <br>
which bearers are perceived, tropes are also perceived.<br>
<br>
It is an open question whether all visual perceptual systems apply kind-type at tribu-<br>
tives—attributives to bearers of features. Some very simple systems may attribute only <br>
color or lightness. Even in more complex systems, rudimentary color vision, with color <br>
constancies, seems to form before and initially independently of spatial constancies, which <br>
might discriminate a bearer of color.173 In such very simple systems, and at early <br>
formation-stages in more complex systems at which spatial perception has not been gen-<br>
erated, nothing in the system functions to pick out <i>bearers</i> of feature-like properties. Yet <br>
particulars can be perceived—perceptually referred to. The particulars that are picked out <br>
would be <i>only</i> instances of color-types.<br>
<br>
As noted in the first, main point, there are different concrete conditions of the bodies—<br>
tropes, localized in space and time—that initiate different causal chains for color and spa-<br>
tial properties. In simple visual systems and very early stages of more complex systems, <br><br>
