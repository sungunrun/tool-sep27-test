perceptual constancies differently from how it explains formation of other sensory states. <br>
The science explains formation of perceptual states by postulating states that are sus cep-<br>
tible to specific types of accuracy or inaccuracy about the environment. The most charac-<br>
teristic, computational, law-like causal patterns cited in perceptual psychology are patterns <br>
that involve states that represent environmental conditions—states that are what they are <br>
by virtue of the way they constitute conditions for being accurate or inaccurate. I take this <br>
point not to be seriously disputable.<br>
<br>
There is extensive work on the probability of <i>how</i> <i>accurate</i> perceptual systems are and <br>
how probable accuracy is for some types of perceptual states in specific conditions. Some <br>
work proves optimality theorems that show that, given limitations of stimulus variability <br>
and noise, human perceptual systems approach a theoretical ideal of accuracy in certain <br>
tasks. (See note 24.) Recent work has even shown what part noise, what part stimulus vari-<br>
ability, and what part less-than-ideal deterministic computations cause human visual sys-<br>
tems to fall short of ideal accuracy. The work shows for one task—speed estimation under <br>
certain conditions—that the computations are nearly ideal and not a significant source of <br>
the gap between the theoretical ideal and actual performance.57<br>
<br>
Explanation of formation of perceptual states that indicate and attribute ordinal-depth <br>
or distance relations, or size, or surface, or 3-D volume shape, or surface reflectance, is <br>
fundamental to perceptual psychology. A state that attributes, or estimates, a depth rela-<br>
tion or a size is susceptible to accuracy or error with regard to that depth or size estimation.<br>
<br>
Perceptual states are partly <i>individuated</i>, in the science, in terms of their veridicality <br>
conditions—conditions for accuracy in picking out and attributing environmental entities <br>
(‘partly’, because psychological mode is also involved). The science identifies the states <br>
partly by how and what they represent. A rationale for doing so resides in the basic goals <br>
of the science—explaining causally how perceptual states are formed when individuals <br>
perceive the environment accurately and explaining causally how perceptual states are <br>
formed that incur illusion.<br>
<br>
Formation of sensory states that are not embedded in perceptual constancies is not <br>
explained by reference to states that are accurate or inaccurate. Such states engage in <i>non-<br>
perceptual</i> sensory registration. They correlate with environmental features, and function <br>
to do so. Their formation and roles in a psychological system are, however, not causally <br>
explained in terms of states with conditions for accuracy. Explanations of formation of <br>
non-perceptual sensory capacities also do not explain accuracy or error, although func-<br>
tional explanations of such capacities may explain their realizing or not realizing their <br><br>
