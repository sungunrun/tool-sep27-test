contentful states, especially on the contents that constitute those states’ repeatable kinds. <br>
There is nothing language-like about the relevant kinds, except that they have representa-<br>
tional structure.<br>
<br>
A computation is a transition from input to output that constitutes a function in the <br>
mathematical sense. Given relevant stimulus input and initial internal states, and given <br>
laws of transition, a computation yields a unique output—a unique representational <br>
state type.<br>
<br>
Actual explanations in mainstream perceptual and motor psychology are over-<br>
whelmingly computational. The gold standard of good explanation is taken to be an <br>
explanation that specifies a computational process. This is not to say that good explanation <br>
must be computational. But computational explanations are prized and dominant in <br>
psychophysics.<br>
<br>
Such explanations allow for noise that makes an actual output, in a given case, not fully <br>
determinable from the stimulus, the initial states, and the laws of transition. Noise is like <br>
friction in physical laws of motion. Visual computations may assign a probability distribu-<br>
tion in which one state emerges after a cost-benefit filter. Many explanations take the per-<br>
ceptual and motor systems to have evolved to operate in a near-optimal way—both <br>
practically and representationally—<i>given</i> that noise is a constant and statistically stable, <br>
factor in forming perceptual states.1156<br>
<br>
Actual explanations in a successful macro-science are signs of causal patterns and nat-<br>
ural kinds in the science’s subject matter. Given perceptual psychology’s success, and given <br>
the form of its explanations, there is good reason to think that computational transitions <br>
are a mark of perception-formation. They provide insight into the distinction between <br>
perceptual attributives and perceptual-level states, on one hand, and conceptual attributives <br>
and cognitive-level states or conceptual-level states, on the other. I think that they provide <br>
insight into the notions perceptual system and perceptual-motor system. Computational <br>
transitions are a specific type of causal pattern. The pattern is automatic and inflexible, <br>
at least when a complex, but relatively manageable set of relevant initial factors is fixed. <br>
The pattern is that of a specific kind of psychological competence.<br>
<br>
I take this explanatory practice to show something important about causal patterns <br>
cited in perceptual and perceptual-level motor psychology. The explanations do not refer <br>
to beliefs, belief-level intentions, or other propositional states. The computations in <br>
perception-formation that they cite—including not just early formation stages, but stages <br>
that include categorization, endogenous attention, task orientation deriving from the <br>
motor system, memory, anticipation, learning, affect, and imagery—omit prop os-<br>
ition al states.<br>
<br>
When one distinguishes <i>perceptual</i> memory and <i>perceptual</i> anticipation—states that <br>
preserve perceptual attributives—from retention of propositional beliefs and prop os-<br>
ition al predictions, it is clear that the latter do not occur in the computations. Only mem-<br>
or ies and anticipations with content borrowed from perceptual states occur. The range of <br>
perceptual attributives that are computed in perception-formation has expanded slightly <br><br>
