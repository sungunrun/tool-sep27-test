194  Form and Semantics of Perceptual Contents</div>
<br><br>
con text ual ly applied to any particular bone, it is the form of a reference to a particular. All <br>
attributions—of body, bonehood, specific shape—accompany a singular form that could <br>
be applied to a particular. So the drawing is not propositional. It is also not quantifica-<br>
tional. It is singular and schematic.<br>
<br>
A generalization of the sort effected by an existential quantifier could not be iconic. The <br>
form of an iconic representation is formally singular. (See Chapter 2, the section The <br>
Three Fundamental Representational Constituents in Perceptual <br>
States.) Simple iconic representations represent through natural correspondences, not <br>
through generalizing. Their form is referential, even if they have been schematized so as to <br>
lack any reference to any actual particular. Ability-general perceptual memory that has <br>
lost reference to actual particulars is schematic, noun-phrase-like representation that is <br>
analogous to such drawings.<br>
<br>
A schematic memory is neither accurate nor inaccurate. It is <i>accurate of</i> some particu-<br>
lars and not others. There is representational success inasmuch as the attributive represen-<br>
tations in memory derive from and correspond to attribute-configurations represented in <br>
past perception. A schematic memory is not accurate of just any particular that its at tribu-<br>
tives are accurate of. Since the representational content is a perceptual-memory content, <i>it</i> <br>
is accurate only of particulars perceived in the past, even though its attributives are ac cur-<br>
ate of any particular that happens to fit them. It schematizes past perceptions, losing <i>de re</i> <br>
connection to particulars that were perceived. In effect, the only allowable substituends <br>
for the schematic free variable in the form<br><br>
(that x)F(x)<br><br>
are past perceptual referential applications of (that x). The memory is accurate only of <br>
past-perceived particulars. The memory’s attributives are not accurate of every particular <br>
in a domain that the accompanying attributive(s) happen to be accurate of, as in schematic <br>
quantification. The schema does not generalize over whatever particulars fit the at tribu-<br>
tives. Indeed, accurate perceptual memories must involve referential applications that <br>
connect causally to referential applications that <i>actually occurred</i> in past perceptions of the <br>
referred to particulars.<br>
<br>
The issue of schematic perceptual memory just raised has a counterpart in schematic <br>
perceptual anticipation. Perceptual anticipation occurs in many perception-connected <br>
processes—for example, in visual search. Imagine an animal that has had enough percep-<br>
tual experiences of a type of prey’s appearing in a certain context to visually anticipate a <br>
moving body of a certain size and shape that functions for the animal as prey. Suppose <br>
that the animal is not tracking a particular prey animal. The predator has been condi-<br>
tioned to perceptually anticipate a moving body of a given size and shape at a given time <br>
and place. That anticipation primes attack. The indefinite perceptual anticipation is analo-<br>
gous to the indefinite perceptual memory just discussed. They differ only in their mode—<br>
visual anticipation rather than visual memory.<br>
<br>
Consider the accuracy conditions of schematic perceptual anticipations. A lion per-<br>
cep tual ly anticipates emergence of an impala-shaped body at a given place and time, <br>
without anticipating a specific particular—as an already perceived impala-shaped <br>
impala-body. The schematic anticipation is, at the time of anticipation, neither accurate <br>
nor inaccurate. It can become accurate <i>of</i> or inaccurate <i>of</i> certain particulars encountered </div>
