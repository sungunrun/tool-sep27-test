Two Types of First-Formed Perception 407</div>
<br><br>
This result is relevant to traditional philosophical thinking about representation. <br>
Leibniz postulated a distinction between discrimination and identification. I take his iden-<br>
tification to be approximately equivalent to what I have been calling ‘categorization’. An <br>
“idea”, including a perceptual representation, that merely discriminates something from a <br>
surround was termed ‘obscure’. An idea that effected identification of a type or attribute <br>
was termed ‘clear’.488<br>
<br>
On a rough, initial gloss, the result just discussed can be characterized in this way: For <br>
first-formed perceptual states, as soon as one forms a representation that discriminates <br>
something from a surround, one often has a clear representation.<br>
<br>
Standard models for ultra-rapid, first categorizations are dominantly feed-forward—<br>
from initial registration of proximal stimulus to first formation of a perceptual <br>
categorization.<br>
<br>
The idea of a predominantly feed-forward, pre-attentive categorization process provides <br>
a rough picture of what goes on. There are, however, loops even within early low-level <br>
processes, where, for example, the results of a second stage of processing are fed back to a <br>
first stage. Such loops enrich and improve the work of the first stage. The point is <i>not</i> that <br>
there is no feedback during the fastest processing. The point is that feedback needed to <br>
produce first perceptual representations does not require infusions from attention, or <br>
occurrent input from memory, much less infusions from cognitive or conceptual repre-<br>
sentation.489 Attention is sometimes needed to resolve crowding or to handle cases in <br>
which cues are impoverished. The kinds of feedback necessary to resolve special problems <br>
vary with the case.<br>
<br>
Resolution is best in foveated areas. Normally, attention is fixed in these areas. Outside <br>
them, resolution falls off rapidly. Perceptual representation nevertheless occurs across the <br>
whole visual field, out to the extreme periphery. Within this range, including both foveal <br>
areas and pre-attentive extra-foveal areas, perceptual representation as of a limited num-<br>
ber of objects, including bodies, in natural scenes is processed in parallel. Perceptual repre-<br>
sentation is organized in a spatial framework, though localization is not as sharp outside <br>
foveal areas.<br>
<br>
A sketch-like visual perception as of a spatially organized set of <i>representata</i> in a natural <br>
scene, with generic-shape and generic category attributions (for example, body, face, and <br>
animal-body) is produced very rapidly. Rough spatial organization, gist-of-scene <br><br>
