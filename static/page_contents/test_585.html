function to encode and retain. Iconic visual <i>concepts</i> can be retained in VWM. VWM has <br>
both perceptual-level and conceptual-level contents. VWM can also retain numerical rep-<br>
resentations, and sums among them, and meaningful sentences. I count the aspect or <br>
operation of working memory that functions to retain conceptual-level contents ‘<i>concep-<br>
tual visual working memory</i>’. I focus on retention of perceptual representational content. <br>
Such retention is a function of working memory at the perceptual-level, though, of course, <br>
it is not itself perception.<br>
<br>
I belabor these points because many philosophers and psychologists have claimed, or <br>
assumed, mistakenly I think, that working memory is a cognitive system without qualifi-<br>
cation. The cited standard scientific characterization, which I accept, makes no such <br>
commitment.<br>
<br>
As a start to delineating this issue, consider a characterization by Baddeley and Logie, <br>
which is, I think, no longer standard. They ‘define’ working memory as comprising<br><br>
those functional components of cognition that allow humans to comprehend and men-<br>
<br>
tally represent their immediate environment, to retain information about their immedi-<br>
<br>
ate past experience, to support the acquisition of new knowledge, to solve problems, and <br>
<br>
to formulate, relate, and act on current goals.<br><br>
They add that they take visual working memory as ‘comprising multiple specialized sub-<br>
components of cognition’.863 They think of working memory as consisting of these compo-<br>
nents: an executive control system and two retention systems—a phonological system, <br>
which subdivides into language-specific and non-linguistic auditory retention systems, <br>
and a visual “sketch pad”. On this conception, working memory not only allows non-<br>
retentional operations, but includes them.<br>
<br>
As discussed in Chapter 15, the section The Executive Control System, and <br>
Propositional Drivers, the <i>executive control system</i> (a) allocates resources, such as <br>
enhancing representation relevant to a task; (b) suppresses irrelevant information and irrel-<br>
evant actions deriving from such information; (c) coordinates processes when plural tasks <br>
are performed at once; (d) initiates rehearsal or maintenance of memories and other states; <br>
(e) shifts attentional and memory-retrieval strategies to serve switches in tasks, and so on.864 <br>
These operations occur at different representational levels, including the perceptual level.<br><br>
