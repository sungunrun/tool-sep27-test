are just dispositional and future-oriented. We saw earlier that perceptual attribution of <br>
body depends on anticipation of generic shape continuity.<br>
<br>
The anticipations are not inductive inferences. They are not cognitive, supra-perceptual <br>
states. They are not products of “reasoning”.592 They are primitive associates of perceptual <br>
capacities. They are at the same representational level as perception. They are no more <br>
“higher-level” or cognitive than perceptual memory or perceptual learning.<br>
<br>
Suppose, for the sake of argument, that primitive representation of mechanical caus-<br>
ation is perceptual. Having that capacity would be associated with dispositions, under <br>
certain conditions, to perceptually anticipate mechanical causation that is not currently <br>
perceived. In watching one body move toward another at a certain speed, there would be <br>
anticipation, just before contact, of perceived contact and of a subsequent perceived sec-<br>
ond body’s moving in a certain approximate direction and at a certain approximate speed.<br>
<br>
All infants in the Ball-type experiments can track bodies behind occlusions. Such track-<br>
ing emerges earlier than representation of mechanical causation. Primitive representation <br>
of body and primitive body-tracking are widely agreed to be perceptual in perceptual <br>
psych ology.593 Tracking a body behind an occlusion requires maintaining perceptual <br>
anticipations of the body’s trajectory after it passes out of view. These are anticipations of <br>
where and when the body will emerge from behind the screen. Similarly, in perceiving a <br>
stationary, partly occluded body, there are often anticipations of where occluded parts of <br>
the body would be if the occlusion were removed.594<br>
<br>
Suppose again that primitive representation of mechanical causation is perceptual. Then <br>
the perceptual anticipations of mechanical causation would be integrated with perceptual <br>
anticipations of bodies’ movements behind occlusions. Primitive representation of mechan-<br>
ical causation is predominantly representation of <i>moving bodies</i> as they interact causally. <br>
Thus if an individual’s primitive representation of mechanical causation is perceptual, it is <br>
almost surely associated with capacities to perceptually anticipate causal interactions <br>
behind occlusions. So the fact that infants anticipate causal interactions behind occlusions <br>
is compatible with Michotte’s claim that primitive representation of mechanical causation is <br>
perceptual. I do not claim that Michotte expected the consequence. I claim that given a cor-<br>
rect understanding of perception, the consequence should be expected. In understanding <br>
the boundaries of perceptual systems, it is important not to underestimate capacities nat ur-<br>
al ly and inevitably involved in them. In particular, perceptual capacities always come with <br>
capacities to perceptually remember and perceptually anticipate currently unperceived <br>
conditions. Such capacities should not be assimilated to cognitive, higher-level inferential <br>
capacities. See Chapters 16–18 for further discussion of these points.<br><br>

<b>FOOTNOTES</b><br>
<b>Cont FN</b>592 Loose uses of the terms ‘inference’ and ‘reasoning’ that pervade developmental psychology, but also percep-<br>
tual psychology, tend to blur significant questions about psychological natural kinds. Nearly any transformation <br>
in an infant’s representational system is casually termed an ‘inference’ or as ‘reasoning’. Loose use of the term <br>
‘reasoning’ is relatively recent. Traditionally, reasoning does not go on in perceptual systems. Kant took it, fruit-<br>
fully, to be necessarily propositional. Cognitive and developmental scientists often write of an infant’s reasoning <br>
without being clear about whether the relevant transformation is perceptual. Broad use of ‘inference’ has a longer <br>
pedigree. Helmholtz wrote of inferences in the visual system. As with broad use of the term ‘reasoning’, such <br>
usage courts unclarity. I use ‘<i>transformation</i>’ or ‘<i>operation</i>’ for the genus of psychologically relevant trans for ma-<br>
tions and ‘inference’ for propositional transformations. I take reasoning always to be propositional.<br>

594 Some scientists assimilate such cases to the perceptual phenomenon of amodal completion. Although the <br>
cases are in some ways similar, tracking-phenomena are more dispositional and less occurrently phenomenal <br>
than standard amodal cases.</div>
