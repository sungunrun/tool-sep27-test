This second form of binding presupposed existence of free-floating features, not located <br>
on any spatial map. This idea was qualified in 1982 by associating individual features with <br>
their own feature maps in response to capacities for detecting patterns of textural or gan-<br>
iza tion. Further evidence against the idea of feature detection separated from any spatial <br>
information came from other sources. Retinotopic mapping is present in the first registra-<br>
tions of visual information, and this initial spatially informed registration influences all <br>
further visual processing.439 Although features can be correctly identified while getting <br>
their locations wrong, the idea of a stage of identification that precedes spatial retinotopic <br>
location has been shown from various quarters to be tenuous at best.440 As we shall see, <br>
further evidence in this direction emerged from the physiological domain.<br>
<br>
The conditions under which attention figures in visual processing were not precisely <br>
established. Attention is sometimes present even in feature searches. It is sometimes absent <br>
in conjunction searches and in other processing of information that combines features <br>
from different dimensions. The theory ‘made little headway in clarifying relationships <br>
between structural constraints of the perceptual system and constraints on deployment of <br>
attention’.441<br>
<br>
Degree of similarity and other factors affect all search tasks, both feature search and <br>
conjunction search. There is evidence that binding registered features into multi-<br>
dimensional clusters <i>is</i> a task for the visual system. Physiological evidence buttressed <br>
behavioral evidence to indicate that there is a task that involves recombining feature <br>
information-registration that (at stage 2, according to the 1988 revised theory) had been <br>
processed separately.442<br>

The 1980–1982 theory was an update of a traditional empiricist view. On the traditional <br>
view, vision first presents sense-data-like color patches, or loose shapeless collections of <br>
other types of data. These representations are not associated with positions in en vir on-<br>
mental space. From these representations, the visual system was supposed to construct <br>
representation of entities in 3-D space by putting together (binding) the color patches into <br>
patterns.443 The lever of construction is exercise of spatial attention. Treisman complicated <br>
her picture in the two decades after the view was first proposed. The picture’s basic outline <br><br>
