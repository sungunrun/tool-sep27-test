<b>The Basic Representational Form of Perceptual States<br><br>
</div>
</b>I introduced perception’s three fundamental representational constituents. They fill the three <br>
primary roles of any representational state. They are psychological kinds—competencies <br>
or exercises of competencies, severally and in structured combinations. They are ways in <br>
which perceptual states function to present <i>representata</i> to the mind—they are modes of <br>
presentation. They combine to set accuracy conditions. (See this chapter, the section <br>
Representations and Representational Contents.) In combining to set <br>
accuracy conditions, these constituents yield perceptual states’ basic representational form. <br>
Here I begin to discuss rudiments of this form. Since representational form is de riva tive <br>
from representational function, and representational function rests on representational <br>
competencies, it is necessary, in order to understand the basic representational structure of <br>
perception, to consider the representational function of perception and the underlying <br>
perceptual competencies. Form follows function. Functions are realized by competencies.<br>
<br>
The representational function of perception is referential specification. It is to pick out <br>
particulars perceptually (perceive them) partly by characterizing them. Picking out par-<br>
ticulars is partly through guidance by accurate characterization and partly through con-<br>
textual causal dependence on particulars that are characterized accurately—at least partly <br>
and approximately accurately. That is, if the “picking out” competence is successfully exer-<br>
cised—and a particular is perceived—, the exercise of the competence, the perceptual ref-<br>
erential application, is caused by the perceived particular; and at least one of the applied <br>
attributives is at least approximately accurate of that particular. Attributives never single <br>
out perceived particulars entirely on their own. (Again, these points are explained in <br>
Chapter 5.)<br>
<br>
The form of perceptual representation reflects perception’s representational function. <br>
That function is to pick out particulars, partly by being caused by them, partly by charac-<br>
terizing them in perceptual ways. The characterizations are exercises of standing <br>
competencies.<br>
<br>
Since the primary function is that of picking out, or referring, the form is that of a rep-<br>
resentational structure that picks out or refers. So the form of perceptual representation is <br>
nominal, or noun-like, hence non-propositional. The conclusion about form is here <br>
derived from reflection on function. Perceptual psychology comes to the same conclusion <br>
from a different route. The extra representational capacity involved in propositional forms <br>
has no explanatory use in perceptual psychology. The extra capacity is that of applying <br>
main-verb-phrase-like attributives that do not function to guide reference or picking-out. <br>
Perceptual psychology treats perceptual states as having the nominal form of maps or <br>
moving pictures. It does not treat them as having propositional form. (See Chapter 9.) The <br>
ordinary-language perceives-that locution is a mix of natural psychological kinds— <br>
perception and belief. Of course, colloquial speech is not a guide to the representational <br>
form of perception. Science is.<br>
<br>
The noun-phrase-like structure reflects the context-bound, occurrent, cause-dependent <br>
aspect of the function, in that the noun-like structure is context-dependent for having a The Basic Representational Form of Perceptual States 49</div>
