Two Lines of Empirical Criticism of Treisman’s Theory 397</div>

not held up. Counter-considerations had emerged before they made the proposal. Others <br>
developed later, some in response to the proposal. I take Evans and Treisman’s three con-<br>
siderations in reverse order.<br>
<br>
First, activity in a brain area specialized for faces—the infero-temporal cortex in mon-<br>
keys and functionally analogous areas in humans—evinces object detectors for faces, tree-<br>
shaped tree-bodies, animal-bodies, transportation-vehicle-bodies, and so on.460<br>
<br>
Second, it is, of course, true that there are fewer ordinary, visually attributable features <br>
than individual objects. Humans are, however, able to recognize individual faces at very <br>
rapid, pre-attentive rates.461 The main issue is not identification of individuals, but attribu-<br>
tion of perceivable attributes. It is likely that given the rapid rates at which visual systems <br>
categorize objects, the process makes use of both relatively simple groupings of relevant <br>
shapes and sub-parts of the overall shape (such as eyes and limbs for categorizing animal-<br>
bodies). I shall return to what is known about how these processes operate. Several consid-<br>
erations converge to undermine the Evans–Treisman proposal that <i>only</i> sub-features are <br>
represented pre-attentively.<br>
<br>
The sheer speed of categorization is one consideration. Evans and Treisman’s processing <br>
picture does not accord well with what was known even at the time of their proposal. <br>
Although transitions from low-level features to a category attribution do occur, there is no <br>
evidence that they are the only transitions. There is evidence that some fast transitions <br>
involve estimates on whole shapes. <i>Representation</i> of wholes can be as fast as any other <br>
environmental feature.462 Partly because of speed considerations, it is now widely accepted <br>
that representation of bodies via their shapes does not require any application of <br>
attention.463<br>
<br>
Another consideration is that not only is there no evidence for exclusively low-level <br>
feature representation at pre-attentive formation stages, attempts to balance low-level fea-<br>
tures between targets and distractors have had no appreciable effect on performance.464<br>
<br>
The large number of categorizations that can be rapidly and pre-attentively produced, <br>
and the specificity of some of the categorizations, argue against taking them all as prod-<br>
uced by rule-of-thumb transformations from low-level features (beak-shapes) to cat egor-<br>
iza tions (bird-bodies). Potter found fast categorization for 28 super-ordinate categories. <br>
The categories purportedly included such specific types as <i>amusement ride</i>, <i>art supply</i>, <br>
<i>baby product</i>, <i>bird</i>, <i>cleaning product</i>, <i>computer part</i>, <i>dessert</i>, <i>flower</i>, <i>footwear</i>, <i>four-footed <br>
animal</i>, <i>fruit</i>, <i>furniture</i>, <i>insect</i>, <i>marine animal</i>, <i>musical instrument</i>, <i>reptile</i>, <i>sport equipment</i>, <br><br>
