not the focus of attention. Such stimuli enhance contrast sensitivity, via recurrent process-<br>
ing, thought to be affected by signals from the amygdala. The amygdala is a brain region <br>
that underlies processing affect information.771 The amygdala sends its signals through <br>
magnocellular neurons, which are known to conduct low-frequency information very fast. <br>
Initial responses to perceptual representation of fearful faces is probably unconscious. The <br>
effects on contrast sensitivity are similar to those by spatial attention that we have dis-<br>
cussed. When spatial attention is applied in response to fearful faces, those effects on con-<br>
trast sensitivity are further amplified.772<br>
<br>
Thus attention can be a connector through which conative states, memory, anticipation, <br>
affect, and imagining affect perceptual sets, perceptual states, and perceptual processing. <br>
I discuss these other capacities in later chapters. I caution here against viewing initiations <br>
of visual attention, even as antecedently caused by events in these other capacities, as an <br>
intrusion into perceptual processing from the outside. A corollary is a caution against <br>
conceiving all attention or attention commands as occurring at, or being initiated at, a <br>
single representational level.<br>
<br>
Exogenous attention is never driven by supra-perceptual states. The causes of percep-<br>
tual attention that consist in selective biasing from factors within perceptual processing <br>
are obviously perceptual-level, not supra-perceptual or conceptual.773 All known percep-<br>
tual systems, including those of lower animals, include a capacity for at least this sort of <br>
attention.774 Even endogenous attention that is specialized for perception, and whose ini ti-<br>
ation is grounded in the frontal eye fields and the parietal lobe, is perceptual level. <br>
Although some authors assume that all initiations of endogenous attention are supra-<br>
perceptual, I reject the assumption. I explain this view over the next sections. Here I make <br>
three points that frame the remainder of this chapter.<br>
<br>
First, there are internal factors that cause endogenous attention that are not under the <br>
individual’s control—memories of past successes in action or of rewards, memories of <br>
perceptually learned statistical relations, presence in working memory, for example.775 Any <br>
of these factors can distract from or contribute to realization of an individual’s projects. <br><br>

<b>FN</b>771 I use ‘<i>emotion</i>’ to apply to <i>representational</i> affect—affect with representational content. <i>Pre-emotional affect</i> <br>
is visceral reaction to practically relevant (say, life-threatening) information, where the affect lacks representa-<br>
tional content. I cite snails’ affect reaction in Chapter 14, the section Relatively Primitive Action. I think <br>
that some human affect is not representational—not emotion.<br>
<b>FN</b>772 Phelps, Ling, and Carrasco, ‘Emotion Facilitates Perception and Potentiates the Perceptual Benefits of <br>
Attention’; Bocanegra and Zeelenberg, ‘Emotion Improves and Impairs Early Vision’. The latter article shows a <br>
familiar tradeoff. Whereas the magnocellular-based responses speed representation at spatial low-frequency <br>
 levels, they impair representation of spatial patterns at high-frequency levels, for example orientation of dark-<br>
light columns, tilted left or right. The low-frequency, magnocellular-based responses crowd out the slower, high-<br>
frequency, parvocellular-based responses.<br>

well made by A. Raftopoulos, ‘Reframing the Problem of Cognitive Penetrability’, in W. Park, P. Li, and L. Magnani <br>

supra-perceptual level of representation.<br>
