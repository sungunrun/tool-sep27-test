or psychologies represent the world. The first psychological conditions in which percep-<br>
tion represents provide insight into reference and attribution in their most primitive forms.<br>
<br>
Perceptual states that have referents are the first empirical <i>de re</i> states. <i>De re</i> states pick <br>
out entities in a direct, non-inferential, not purely attributional way.381 Perceptual beliefs—<br>
beliefs that depend most directly on perception for their content—are also empirically <i>de <br>
re</i>. (See Chapter 9, the section Perceptual Contents, Propositions, and Noun <br>
Phrases.) However, their perceptual antecedents are the states on which all other empir-<br>
ically <i>de re</i> states depend, for their content and epistemic warrant. I am interested in the <br>
first perceptual states formed in the order of causal processing, in human and other <br>
 perceptual systems. I call these states <i>first-formed perceptual states</i>.<br>
<br>
This chapter centers on two questions. First: What sorts of things do first-formed <br>
 perceptions represent? Second: Do referential applications and perceptual attributives in <br>
first-formed perceptions require help from further psychological capacities, such as input <br>
from memory, attention, or concepts, in order to represent physical bodies, 3-D volume <br>
shapes, and other ecologically central properties of particulars in the environment?<br>
<br>
Since the 1970s, few if any mainstream visual psychologists have thought that all forma-<br>
tion of perception <i>requires</i> help from concepts. During that time, however, several lines of <br>
work in psychology suggested views that are similar in spirit to a perception-always-needs-<br>
help-from-concepts view. According to them, one initially perceives very little of what we <br>
normally think we perceive in any given perceptual state. Specifically, they maintained that <br>
representing bodies and various 3-D volume shapes—some of the basic cat egor iza tions <br>
that common sense recognizes—requires multiple views of a scene, serial applications or <br>
shifts of attention, occurrent input from long-term perceptual or conceptual memory, or <br>
the like.<br>
<br>
On such views, prior to applications of attention, or prior to specific inputs from mem-<br>
ory, or prior to interfaces between perception and conception, we perceive some things. <br>
But these views hold that under such conditions, we perceive little that we ordinarily think <br>
we do. We do not perceive bodies or “objects” with multiple properties. On some of these <br>
views, we do not even perceive, as such, 3-D volume shapes. The impression that we can <br>
perceptually attribute bodies, 3-D volume shapes, and so on, is supposed to derive from <br>
serial applications of attention or conceptual help. Short of such help, on these views, per-<br>
ception yields almost nothing about the environment as we commonly conceive it. Our <br>
impression of <i>perceptual</i> richness is an illusion.<br>
<br>
It is certainly true that we tend, in some respects, to overestimate how much we per-<br>
ceive. For example, we tend to underestimate the huge difference between foveal percep-<br>
tion and peripheral perception. The center of our visual fields, especially for things at <br>
relatively close ranges, are vastly more acute and specific than our peripheral perception. <br>
We tend to overstate how much of what we are aware of through perception is due to per-<br>
ception itself. For example, it is common to say that we see a physical body as a baseball <br>
bat or x-ray machine. Of course, we do see baseball bats and x-ray machines, and know <br><br>

<b>FOOTNOTES</b><br>
<b>Cont FN</b>381 Of course, perceptual states are formed by a series of transformations. They are not formed by what I count <br>
as inferences—<i>propositional</i> transformations. Nor do they constitutively contribute to states that undergo prop-<br>
os ition al transformations. Referential applications make even propositional attitudes not-purely-conceptual and <br>
not-purely-attributional. See Burge, ‘Belief <i>De Re</i>’. They make perceptual states not-purely-attributional. They are <br>
not in any respect or degree conceptual. Recall that I mean by ‘concept’ an ability-general representation that <br>
constitutively contributes, as a sub-propositional component, to propositional structure. (See Chapter 2, the sec-<br>
tion The Three Fundamental Representational Constituents in Perceptual States.)</div>
