614 Perceptual Long-Term Memory</div>

memory go via causal chains, back to one or more specific referential applications to the <br>
same particulars in past perceptions. I call this type ‘de re <i>long-term visual memory</i>’. A sub-<br>
species of <i>de re</i> long-term visual memory is <i>visual episodic memory</i>. It retains representa-<br>
tions of past particulars from perception and retains perceptual representation of them as <br>
they were perceived on particular occasions or episodes.<br>
<br>
The vast preponderance of long-term visual memory is ability-general. Such memory <br>
has no <i>de re</i> elements—no referential applications—that function to pick out past per-<br>
ceived particulars. (It may retain referential applications in spatial or temporal egocentric <br>
indexes.) Recall the explication of <i>de re</i> representation from Chapter 6, the section <br>
Referential Application to Property Instances in Perception: De re <br>
<i>representation</i> is direct, non-inferential, referential representation of an entity that is not <br>
representation entirely through attribution. Ability-general visual perceptual long-term <br>
memory functions to retain representational content, perhaps modified in limited ways, <br>
from past perceptions. No memory of specific particulars remains. The memory’s connec-<br>
tion via causal chains to past-perceived particulars has been broken or is too tangled to <br>
represent any particular, although particulars did, of course, generate perceptions from <br>
which the memory derives.<br>
<br>
The attributives in such memories are retained from past perceptual representation. But <br>
since perceptual representation of particulars has been lost to memory, ability-general <br>
long-term memories lack referential applications to any particular. For example, one <br>
might retain a memory of a curved, tubular shape, of a certain size [in fact, about 8 inches <br>
long and 2–3 inches wide], tapering more narrowly at each end, and colored yellow. The <br>
memory does not function to represent any particular instance of this complex of <br>
attributes.<br>
<br>
In the scientific literature, ability-general long-term memory is often called ‘semantic <br>
memory’ or ‘stored knowledge’.958 I avoid these terms. I think each misleading. ‘Semantic’ is <br>
inappropriate for two reasons. One is that there is nothing semantic about the memory: it <br>
is not in itself about the relation between representations and the world. It is normally <br>
about the world, not about representation. The other is that memory’s <i>having</i> a semantics <br>
does not differentiate any specific type of memory: all memory has a semantics. “Muscle <br>
memory” does not. But as a matter of terminology, I do not count “muscle memory”, or <br>
procedural memory, as a type of memory. All types of (<i>representational</i>) memory have a <br>
semantics.<br>
<br>
‘Stored knowledge’ is even more misleading. Only propositional memory—whether <i>de <br>
re</i> or ability-general—and perhaps some other higher-level memory, like memory of “tacit <br>
knowledge” of a grammar, is knowledge. At any rate, stored perception is not knowledge. <br>
The difference between the <i>de re</i> memories and schematically general memories does not <br>
hinge on issues about knowledge. The difference is that the representations in <i>de re</i> mem-<br>
ory are as of particular entities—objects or events—whereas those in ability-general long-<br>
term memory are not.<br><br>

confused in both articles.AQ:3<br><br>
