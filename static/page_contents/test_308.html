308 The Iconic Nature of Perception</div>
<br><br>
Visual perception is always from a perspective that is marked by the way perceived <br>
objects affect our sensors. Retinal position almost inevitably affects mode of presentation.<br>
<br>
These points support the double-indexing method that I employed in developing the <br>
form of perceptual representational contents. (See Chapter 7, the section The Form of <br>
Perceptual Attributives in Linkages.) An attributive is constitutively as of an <br>
attribute. Different attributives can indicate, and attribute, the same attribute. The way in <br>
which the attribute is represented, which depends largely on the retinal source of the rep-<br>
resentation, is constitutive of a representation. Different attributives that indicate the same <br>
entity do so through a perspective that is marked by features—prominently spatial fea-<br>
tures—of the entity’s effect on the retina.<br>
<br>
Spatial and feature-based attention, both their initiations or commands and their <br>
effects—are grounded in visual field maps. Not surprisingly, the mechanisms of visual <br>
attention coordinate with the visual field maps that support perceptual processing.316<br>
<br>
So far, I have discussed visual maps at the neural level. What bases are there for <br>
 taking neural maps, which are not themselves representational, to bear on the format <br>
of visual representational contents—that is, with kinds of perceptual representational <br>
competencies? Of course, it is immensely plausible, antecedent to specific evidence, that <br>
the functions and causal relations involved in visual perception capitalize upon, or <br>
show the marks of, the underlying neural maps. Specific evidence backs this natural <br>
expectation.<br>
<br>
There are systematic correlations between activity in neural areas and perceptual func-<br>
tions. Such correlations are specific enough to connect features of the visual field maps <br>
with corresponding features of perceptual representation.<br>
<br>
Stimulation that yields directional change in a neural visual map, or that affects a pos-<br>
ition in a neural map, corresponds with perceptual representations (and behavioral <br>
responses) in the corresponding direction or position.317 (I assume here, what I have <br>
repeatedly emphasized in earlier chapters, that direction is not <i>represented</i> perceptually <br>
unless it is combined with ordinal depth or with distance in a 3-D mapping.) Similarly, <br>
perception of motion and experience of motion aftereffects correlate with direction of <br>
changes in underlying firings across neural visual field maps.318 In binocular rivalry, <br>
changes in perceptual dominance from one eye to the other commonly correspond to <br>
directional waves of firing across a V1 map.319<br>
<br>
Crowding is a degradation of perceptual representation by nearby distal stimuli. <br>
Crowding appears to be determined by spacing between stimuli on visual field maps. So <br><br>
