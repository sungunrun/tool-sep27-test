590 Perceptual Memory: Short-Term Systems</div>
<br><br>
working memory for various low-level perceived attributes occurs in low-level visual <br>
areas—not in the pre-frontal cortex, as was once thought. These areas have not been asso-<br>
ciated with exercises of propositional capacities. Similarly, patterns of brain activity in IT <br>
(infero-temporal cortex) that underlie working memory that retains perceptual cat egor-<br>
iza tion are also involved in working memory storage. Retentions of attributives at lower <br>
levels appear to be dissociable from retention of attributives at higher perceptual levels. <br>
VWM retention is distributed. Much of the distribution is among brain areas that uncon-<br>
troversially underpin visual perception and have not been found to support exercise of <br>
propositional capacities.874<br>
<br>
So visual working memory is supported by brain activity in all the visual areas. Neural <br>
firing patterns correlated with visual attributives continues several seconds after the <br>
ex ogen ous stimulus is removed. When subjects are tasked to remember a precise orienta-<br>
tion, this information is recoverable from firing patterns in sensory areas, including V1 <br>
(during second-pass recurrent processing), where orientation tuning is strongest.<br>
<br>
Whereas initial retention in VWM is supported in the same brain areas in which visual <br>
perceptions are supported, the maintenance of working memory through rehearsal is sup-<br>
ported by areas of the parietal and pre-frontal cortices. So when storage is under en dogen-<br>
ous control, there is interaction between the main visual processing areas and areas <br>
associated with executive control—for example, areas in the anterior cingulate and lateral <br>
prefrontal cortex. Then VWM is operated upon by endogenous rehearsal mechanisms <br>
guided by attention. Sometimes maintenance is caused by conceptual antecedents. <br>
Similarly, the attention that helps with selection, control, and manipulations on visual <br>
memory (operations such as rotation) has parietal and pre-frontal underpinnings, includ-<br>
ing the frontal eye fields (FEF), which also underpin controlled saccades.875<br>
<br>
Again, these attentional and control operations on the initial retentions in visual work-<br>
ing memory are not in themselves cognitive in any sense that entails a supra-perceptual <br>
level of representation. Insofar as initiations of them have representational content, they <br>
are perceptual-level attention commands, in addition to any antecedent conceptual atten-<br>
tion commands that may drive them. (See Chapters 14 and 15 for parallel points.) <br>
Propositional thinking can direct attention. As far as is now known, the effects of concep-<br>
tually directed attention on perception and perceptual working memory occur only by <br>
causing perceptual-level attention commands before or during visual processing, or <br>
through perceptual priming or perceptual anticipation. I return to some of these points in <br>
Chapter 18, the section Perceptual Anticipation and in Chapter 19.<br><br>
