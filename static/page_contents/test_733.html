the first number sign, they seem to take other signs to apply to plural items, with no rule as <br>
to how many.1199<br>
<br>
What is the form of these attributions? Children have language by this time. So they <br>
have propositional capacities. On the other hand, all they need to answer the questions is <br>
the standard noun-phrase form: that F or those Fs. Here, F characterizes the objects in the <br>
set or aggregate, and those can apply to a plurality of any size, or at least any size of set or <br>
aggregate whose members the child can tag. There is no evidence of an attributive that <br>
applies to the set or aggregate, since the difference between singular and plural demon-<br>
stratives makes the distinction that a child makes at this stage. I think it open whether the <br>
capacity is perceptual-level, non-propositional-cognitive, or propositional.<br>
<br>
What is the form of the capacity shown at the stage around 3½ years at which children <br>
apply the first four signs in their order list to the cardinality of sets or aggregates of sizes 1 <br>
through 4? This performance seems to exhibit a capacity to track the number of referential <br>
applications used in perceptual-level multiple-object tracking and held in working mem-<br>
ory. The child clearly distinguishes (that x1)F(x1) from (that x1)(that x2)F(x1)F(x2), and both <br>
from (that x1)(that x2)(that x3)F(x1)F(x2)F(x3), and a similar content with four referential <br>
applications.1200 Making these distinctions does not require a cognitive capacity. There <br>
seems no need to take the child to apply non-perceptual attributives. A capacity to track a <br>
number of objects up to about four is a known perceptual-level capacity.<br>
<br>
When a child expands this capacity to the items in the ordered tagging list—say, a list of <br>
30 tags—a capacity emerges that has no counterpart in perceptual-level representation, as <br>
far as I know. I know of no evidence of a perceptual-level capacity to track that many ref-<br>
erential applications, for an exact number of references. The form may still be that of a <br>
noun-phrase governed by multiple referential applications. So the form may not be prop-<br>
os ition al. I believe that this capacity may be a non-propositional, cognitive capacity.<br>
<br>
Mastery of the successor function adds to this rudimentary understanding of finite car-<br>
dinality. It adds mastery of the most basic principle of ordinal number—adding 1. It adds <br>
taking in that there is no limit to such adding. Here we are clearly in cognitive territory. <br>
Recursion seems not to occur in perception. There seems to be an attributive one more F <br>
than those 30 Fs<i>.</i> There are too many taggings in tracking the list-order to be a perceptual-<br>
level capacity. The cited attributive does not function to guide a referential application to a <br>
particular. The attribution characterizes a set or aggregate of particulars and requires those <br>
particulars already to be picked out. I conjecture that addition of 1 is conceptual, not just <br>
cognitive.<br>
<br>
It is obvious, I think, that mastery of elementary operations of logical deduction is <br>
propositional. The logical connectives not, or, if-then, and, and quantifiers like every, some, <br>
most are operations in propositional structures. See Chapter 6, the section Absence in <br>
Perception of Negations, Conditionals, Disjunctions, and Quantifiers.<br>
<br>
There is evidence that the numerical capacities just discussed are not in themselves lin-<br>
guistic capacities, but are part of a distinct cognitive system, although it has not been <br>
shown that the system can develop without linguistic capacities. Similarly, the cognitive, <br>
spatial scaling capacities discussed earlier seem to comprise a distinct cognitive system, as <br><br>

capacity in roughly the terms set out here—as involving a limited set of pointers and object files.</div>
