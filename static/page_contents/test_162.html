are different concrete physical conditions of the body that instantiate the color (or dis pos-<br>
ition to reflect light, characteristic of the color) and the shape. These are property-<br>
instances. When light hits the concrete condition of the body that produces a certain <br>
reflectance, a causal chain is set off that affects the sensors, and eventually the aspect of the <br>
perceptual state that responds to color. (Here, I need not assume that color is the re flect-<br>
ance, though I think that in certain cases it is. It is enough that color is not an illusion, and <br>
that instances of it depend in some way on interactions between objects and light, perhaps <br>
involving other factors.) Similarly, with the shape. The bending shape of a body, or bodily <br>
surface, causes a light array with a corresponding bend and a registration of the retinal <br>
image that has a 2-D impact from that bend.<br>
<br>
The idea that the body, not any of its particular occurrent concrete aspects, not any <br>
spatially and temporally localized conditions of the body, is the sole non-repeatable <i>par-<br>
ticular</i> in the causal chains that are germane to what is perceived does not accord with <br>
what we know about the causal sequences. It does not face up to the distinctions among <br>
causal factors in producing a pattern of light that affects the perceptual system: the con-<br>
crete color factors differ from the concrete shape and size factors. The factors in a pattern <br>
of light that are associated with color and shape(-size), respectively, are both concrete and <br>
different. A perceptual system’s responses to the different causal particulars (color-relevant <br>
factors that are conditions of the body and shape-size-relevant factors that are conditions <br>
of the same body) through their effects on the proximal-stimulus light array are responses <br>
to different concrete, conditions of the body that is seen. Those concrete conditions of the <br>
body are tropes. Perceptual states respond to them by being differentially causally affected <br>
by them. Individuals perceive them.<br>
<br>
There is nothing metaphysically suspect about tropes. They are recognized in ordinary <br>
descriptions of causal transactions in the physical world. Reflectance is one feature-<br>
instance of a body at a time—often taken to instantiate color by the science. Shape and size <br>
are other temporally indexed feature-instances. Macro-bodies are described in many ways <br>
in macro-physics. Nearly all of these allow for spatial tropes. To take one prominent one, <br>
spatial property-instances are associated with what is known in continuum mechanics as <br>
the configuration of a body. A body’s configuration at a time is a mapping of material <br>
points on the body’s surface to spatial points that coincide with the body’s outer bound-<br>
ary.172 The arrangement of material points that is thus mapped at a given time constitutes <br>
an instance of the body’s shape. This shape-instance is material, hence has the sort of <br>
causal power that can and does affect visual sensors. Light bounces off it. This shape-<br>
instance differs from the arrangement of spatial points to which the configuration maps it <br>
not only in that it has such causal power, but also in that it moves when the body moves, <br>
whereas the arrangement of spatial points does not. At any given time, an instance of the <br>
body’s shape spatially coincides not only with a region of space, but also with an instance <br>
of a body’s size, with the body’s whole outer surface, and with the aggregate of particles (or <br>
particle-surfaces) that make up that whole outer surface. The individuation conditions of <br>
these four material entities differ. The body’s size-instance can stay the same while the <br><br>
