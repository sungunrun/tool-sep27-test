152 PercePtual reference requires PercePtual attribution</div>
<br><br>
In <i>Origins of Objectivity</i> and elsewhere, I repeatedly assert that we perceive—per cep tual ly <br>
refer to—property-instances (or tropes) and events.165 In fact, I think that on <i>every</i> occa-<br>
sion on which one perceives something, even when one perceives “objects”, one also per-<br>
ceives property-instances. In the passage quoted above, and elsewhere, Schellenberg takes <br>
up my view on the range of entities perceived—even using my term ‘particular’, and <br>
explaining it exactly as I do.166 Schellenberg’s characterization of my view is spectacularly <br>
careless and off track.<br>
<br>
I turn to Schellenberg’s arguments for her view. The discussion is a variant of that of <br>
Pylyshyn and Fodor, though she does not cite this prominent antecedent of her view. Her <br>
claim that ‘Marcus, Donnellan, and Kripke have shown that one can refer to an object in <br>
one’s environment even if the properties one attributes to it are not instantiated by the <br>
object’ (see note 162 again) is simply not true. What they showed is that one can refer to <br>
an object <i>in language</i> even though the properties that one attributes to it <i>in language</i> are <br>
not instantiated by the object. They showed that attributions do not in general suffice to <br>
pick out the referents of names or referring phrases.<br>
<br>
The phrase ‘the properties’ is off base. Nothing that these philosophers argued tends to <br>
show that a referred-to entity lacks <i>all</i> the properties that the individual attributes to it, if <br>
one includes psychological as well as overt linguistic attributions. Psychological attribu-<br>
tions must be included because these figure in ways an individual represents objects <br>
referred to via language. In the cases that those philosophers discuss, one can easily find an <br>
attributive, not explicit in the language, that the individual plausibly attributes— perhaps <br>
in a background assumption, perhaps in perception—that helps guide the reference and <br>
that is veridical of the referent.<br>
<br>
Nothing that these philosophers wrote even aimed to show that reference occurs without <br>
<i>any</i> attribution, or that no used attributive is veridical of a referred-to entity. For ex ample, <br>
in Donnellan’s referential use cases (‘the man drinking the martini’), it is clear that the indi-<br>
vidual relies on perceptual beliefs that accurately attribute physical properties (such a being <br>
a coherent body) to the individual being referred to. The beliefs would be derived from <br>
perceptual representations that get some of the referred-to individual’s properties right.167<br><br>

<b>Cont FN</b>165 As a small sample, see Burge, ‘Five Theses on <i>De Re</i> States and Attitudes’, 254, 257, 277, 279, 287, 295; <br>
Burge, <i>Origins of Objectivity</i>, 32, 54–55, 83–84, 166, 246, 263, 380, 385, 444, 496, 549. For example, in intro du-<br>
cing the term ‘particulars’ in <i>Origins of Objectivity</i>, 54–55, I write: ‘<i>Particulars</i> are non-shareable, non-repeatable, <br>
non-multi-realizable entities. . . . Particulars may be individuals like Fido or events like the explosion of a bomb at <br>
a given time. They may also be <i>tropes</i> or <i>instantiations (instances of)</i> properties or relations.’ (Italics in original.)<br>
166 ‘Particular’ was not commonly used in philosophical discussions of perception in the last few decades <br>
before I used it. It has antecedents Strawson’s, <i>Individuals:</i> <i>An Essay in Descriptive Metaphysics</i>. I explicate the <br>
term in Burge, <i>Origins of Objectivity</i>, 54–55, citing events, tropes, and events, as well as individuals, like bodies, <br>
as particulars. Schellenberg uses framework, ideas, and other terminology that are very specific to my work, <br>
without acknowledgment. For example, she uses without citing their source, my terms ‘semantic generality’ and <br>
‘syntactic generality’: Schellenberg, ‘Perceptual Particularity’, 37, 48. I coined and explained these terms (along <br>
with the term ‘ability-general’) in 2003, in T. Burge, ‘Descartes, Bare Concepts, and Anti-Individualism: Reply to <br>
Normore’, in M. Hahn and B. Ramberg eds., <i>Reflections and Replies: Essays on the Philosophy of Tyler Burge</i> <br>
(Cambridge, MA: The MIT Press, 2003). I have frequently used and explained the terms since—especially in <br>
Burge, ‘Five Theses on <i>De Re</i> States and Attitudes’. See also Burge, <i>Origins of Objectivity</i>, 242, 266, 379–380, 394, <br>
539, 543. They make distinctions that are not immediately obvious. Strikingly, Schellenberg also does not <br>
acknowledge the priority of Pylyshyn and Fodor in holding that, in perception, particulars are picked out <br>
 without attributives. Of course, this is a view that I reject. See note 138.<br>
167 K. Donnellan, ‘Reference and Definite Descriptions’, <i>The Philosophical Review</i> 75 (1966), 281–304. The <br>
proper name cases that these philosophers discuss are less obvious, but also less relevant to perception. Even in <br>
the names cases, none of these philosophers showed, or tried to show, that there can be cases in which an object <br>
is named, but there is <i>no</i> guiding attributive. (<i>cont.</i>)</div>
