representing very limited spatial or temporal relations—for example, the distance of a <br>
color patch from viewer position, or the depth of a color patch relative to the viewer’s <br>
nose, or the relative depth between a color patch and a background with respect to the <br>
viewer. Most frameworks involve some attribution of specific magnitudes—say, distance <br>
and direction from the viewer. Many frameworks map whole areas of nearby space so as to <br>
assign many specific positions, relative to the viewer.<br>
<br>
All spatial perception is related to an egocentric spatial framework. This point is widely <br>
recognized in vision science. The consensus was not always in place. David Marr, probably <br>
the key person in the acceleration of growth in vision science, thought that basic percep-<br>
tual representations of shape are entirely object-centered, not egocentric.<br>
<br>
Marr maintained that ‘the main job of vision [is] to derive a representation of shape’ and, <br>
more specifically, ‘a completely invariant shape description’.239 Marr took a primary thread in <br>
visual processing to run from registrations of the retinal image to object-centered representa-<br>
tions of objects. In an object-centered representation, the origin of a coordinate system for <br>
mapping an object is on the object itself. Such a system is a type of allocentric representation.<br>
<br>
The idea that perception itself could represent anything in a <i>purely</i> object-centered <br>
framework is implausible. All perceptual representation seems to be from the perspective <br>
of the viewer <i>and</i> contains representation limited to the viewer’s “angle” on the subject <br>
matter. That is, all visual perceptual representation incorporates a viewer-anchored origin. <br>
Marr was aware of this intuition. He took all 3-D volume shape representations to be <br>
 <i>independent</i> of perspectival representation that has a viewer-centered, egocentric origin. <br>
He thought that what is constant in a perceptual constancy for 3-D volume shape—the <br>
representation of the distal shape itself—should be detached from perspectival elements <br>
inherent in egocentrically anchored representations.240<br>
<br>
Marr’s proposal to confine 3-D volume shape attributives to object-centered ones never <br>
gained traction. It was almost immediately recognized not to provide sufficient complex-<br>
ity to produce the shape-detail present in visual perception. More centrally, the proposal <br>
provided insufficient resources to account for variation in shape representation that <br>
derives from viewer perspective. The complexity of feature appearance and the huge var-<br>
iety of effects of occlusion made the idea that an object shape could be represented in one <br>
object-centered representation unworkable. Accounts of shape, even by those heavily <br>
influenced by Marr, abandoned Marr’s idea. All visual spatial perceptual representation <br>
was taken to be associated with viewer-centered frameworks.241 Neural evidence emer ging <br>
after Marr’s death failed to support Marr’s proposal.242<br><br>
