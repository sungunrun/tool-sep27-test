it does not have (not applying any shape attributive). One cannot misperceive a texture-<br>
instance only as a direction, or a time only as a place.<br>
<br>
These impossibilities derive from the fact that perception of a given type of particular <br>
(say, a color-instance) derives from standing perception competencies to perceive <br>
instances of a given generic type. For example, perception of a color-instance derives from <br>
standing color perception competencies. Relevant standing perceptual competencies are <br>
perceptual attributives.<br>
<br>
What particulars one perceives depends partly on the representational competencies <br>
that accompany and guide perception (perceptual reference), including the generic type of <br>
attributional capacity that a specific capacity instantiates. One can perceive a color-<br>
instance only if the perception is guided by a color attributive, or color competence. One <br>
can perceive a shape-instance only if the perception is guided by a shape attributive, or <br>
shape competence.<br>
<br>
One never perceives abstract shape or color-<i>types</i> themselves. One perceives only <br>
 particulars—instances of attribute-types. This point will recur. So I elaborate it here briefly. <br>
Particulars are localized to places and times. Attribute-types are not. Attribute-types are <br>
either abstract, as I think. Or they are huge particulars, spread out over space-time— <br>
consisting of all their instances—past, present, future. Insofar as they are abstract, in the <br>
sense of not occupying space or time, they are incapable of causal power. Insofar as they <br>
are huge particulars spread-out over space-time, they are not sufficiently local to a space-<br>
time region to be fruitfully and illuminatingly taken to have specific causal impacts on <br>
individuals’ retinal nerve endings. Particulars cause perception. Abstract shapes or color-<br>
types do not cause particular perceptions. Their occurrences, or instances, or tropes do. <br>
Abstract shapes or color-types are not perceived. Their instances are. Shape-types and <br>
color-types are perceptually <i>indicated</i> and perceptually <i>attributed</i>. They are not perceptually <br>
referred to. As will emerge (Chapter 6, the section BetoKening and Four TyPeS of <br>
PercePtual AttriBution), instances of attributes can be perceptually attributed <br>
along with the types.<br>
<br>
The form of representational hierarchies must, of course, be determined empirically. <br>
How a perceptual system groups the most specifically perceived attributes into more <br>
generic attributes, which themselves are perceptually attributed and perceptually remem-<br>
bered when the more specific attributes are attributed, is a matter of the specific capacities <br>
of the perceiver.<br>
<br>
Perhaps very generic groupings of shapes—for example, a grouping of 3-D volume <br>
shapes having a connected outer boundary—are innate. Many intermediate generic <br>
groupings are learned. Perhaps an ape learns that a certain spherical shape and size cor res-<br>
ponds to a certain range of edibles. The ape acquires, through learned grouping, an <br>
intermediate-level attributive.<br>
<br>
Grouping can be specific to an individual. In adaptation, attributive groupings <br>
change over short periods of time—depending on what stimuli occurred just before a <br>
perceptual episode.<br>
<br>
Consider adaptation to the shape configurations that are the basis for attributing <br>
 face-expression-types. Adaptation is known to occur on perception of shapes.134 There are <br><br>
