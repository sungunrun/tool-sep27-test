positions are absent from mainstream vision science. Attributions of functional properties <br>
in perceptual systems or perceptual-level actional systems are possible only via attribu-<br>
tions of properties like shape and color that cue representations of functional properties.<br>
<br>
Social psychology has recently generated a blizzard of claims that cognition affects what one <br>
sees.671 Many such claims are not informed by the sophisticated methods of mainstream per-<br>
ceptual psychology. Many naively overlook availability of better explanations of the phenom-<br>
ena that they present. Other views hold, from the armchair, that all perceptual representational <br>
contents must show themselves useful to action,672 or that some perceptual representations in a <br>
modality are relations between environmental entities and actional capabilities.<br>
<br>
<i>Evidence</i> for perceptual representation inevitably derives from effects of perception on <br>
an animal’s psychological systems, on changes in its brain, and on its behavioral responses. <br>
Many such responses are actions. Action is only one of several sources of evidence about <br>
what and how perceivers perceptually discriminate. The science of perception is not <br>
 centered on action. It does not take action to be a limiting factor on what properties per-<br>
ception represents.<br>
<br>
Perceptual science is primarily driven by determining types and means of dis crim in-<br>
ation of environmental (and in the case of proprioception, bodily) phenomena, embedded <br>
in perceptual constancies. The science tries to find possible discriminating responses to <br>
attributes in discovering what attributes are perceptually represented. It assumes that all <br>
perceptual states and processes were partly molded by their role in animal response pack-<br>
ages that were selected for fitness for survival to reproduce. But perceptual science does <br>
not systematically peek at actional upshots of sensory intakes in order to determine the <br>
representational contents of perception. Perception picks out environmental entities. Most <br>
such entities are potentially relevant to action. The natures of the pickings-out, however, <br>
depend on discriminative capacities, not action capacities. Discrimination depends not <br>
only on actional upshots but on the physical capabilities of the perceptual system.<br>
<br>
It is not constitutively impossible for a perceptual system to make more or fewer per-<br>
ceptual discriminations than are needed, or can be reflected in, action by the perceiver. <br><br>

<b>Cont FN</b><i>Basic Minds Without Content</i> (Boston, MA: MIT Press, 2013). Many of the criticisms of the Gibsonian approach <br>
cited in the previous footnote are transferrable to this neo-Gibsonian approach. Many enactivist views propose, <br>
as Gibson did, to avoid postulating any representational states at all in explanations of perception. None of the <br>
enactivist positions—most of which are put forward by philosophers—are backed by controlled, detailed em pir-<br>
ic al evidence, or rigorous mathematical explanations. These approaches often use truisms, dressed up in grandi-<br>
ose terms, with vague claims about the nature of perception that pose no serious empirical alternatives to <br>
mainstream perceptual psychology.<br>
