in the future. What makes the perceptual anticipation accurate of some future-encountered <br>
particular?<br>
<br>
An impala-shaped impala-body must appear at the relevant place and time, supposing <br>
that representational content to include an attribution of a place and a future time. The <br>
mere existence, at the time and place, of a particular that satisfies the attributives in the <br>
representational content does not, however, render the anticipation accurate of that par-<br>
ticular. If a lion perceptually anticipates an impala-shaped impala-body at a given place <br>
and future time, and there is such a body at that time and place, the lion’s anticipation is <br>
not thereby fulfilled. It is not thereby accurate of that body. The lion must perceive the <br>
body—connect to it in a singular, perceptual way—if the perceptual anticipation is to <br>
be fulfilled. The state is <i>perceptual</i> anticipation. The anticipation is made accurate by the <br>
impala body only through the lion’s having a perception of the impala body as being an <br>
impala-shaped impala-body. This point is the analog of the point about schematic, ability-<br>
general memory. The memory and anticipation schematize past or future perceptual <br>
 representations. They do not quantify over just any object that their attributives are <br>
accurate of.<br>
<br>
Perceptual anticipations differ from some anticipations in thought in just this way. <br>
An existential quantification of the attributives for an impala-shaped impala-body (even <br>
localized <i>de re</i> to a perceptually represented place at a perceptually marked time) <i>would</i> be <br>
made veridical by the mere existence of such a body at the relevant place and time—unless <br>
the thought specified the body as perceived<i>.</i> Perceptual anticipations cannot attribute <br>
<i>being perceived</i>. What is needed to make a perceptual anticipation accurate of a particular <br>
is a perception of a particular that fits the anticipation’s mode, attributive structure, and <br>
representational function.<br>
<br>
Again, the relation to existential quantification is only superficial. The schema is realized <br>
and made accurate only by perceived, referred-to particulars, not by just any particular that <br>
happens to fit the anticipatory state’s attributives. I think that there is no non-propositional <br>
existential-like operator that operates in or on the representational content.<br>
<br>
So the exemplified committal perceptual anticipation is fulfilled if and only if a per-<br>
ceptual referential application refers to a particular impala-shaped impala-body at the <br>
anticipated place and time. The commitment in visual anticipation is to a schematic repre-<br>
sentational content’s being made non-schematic by a future singular perceptual <br>
application-event’s filling in the schema.<br><br>
Visual Anticipation:<br>
<br>
(egocentric-here xh)(egocentric-now xt)(that x)<br>
<br>
[(that y)(impala-shape(c)(x), impala-shape(i)(y), Loc(c)(x, L, xh, xt+n), impala-body(i)(x))],<br><br>
is neither accurate nor inaccurate when it is formed. The formula should be read, ‘that <br>
impala-body x with impala-shape, and having that instance y of impala-shape, at location <br>
L with respect to ego-hereh, at n temporal units from ego-nowt’—where the ‘that’s are not <br>
yet referentially applied.<br>
<br>
The units marked by ‘L’ and ‘n’ are constants. In a fully specified content, they would not <br>
be canonical names. Here the constants stand in for relational attributives that figure in <br>
the spatial and temporal frameworks, which I discuss in Chapter 8. The subscripts ‘h’ and <br>
‘t’ mark specific indexical referential applications to a specific place and time, respectively.</div>
