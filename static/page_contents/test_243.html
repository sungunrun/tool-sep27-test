The Form of Perceptual Attributives in Linkages 243</div>
<br><br>
I call this scheme of representation ‘<i>attributive double-indexing</i>’. The superscripts and <br>
the word-like symbols mark distinct semantical roles in the attributive. How are these <br>
roles related?<br>
<br>
The superscripts mark different perceptual attributives, constituting different psycho-<br>
logical capacities and perspectivally different modes of representation. In a psychology, a <br>
superscript corresponds to the specific way in which the capacity to attribute and indicate <br>
the attribute can be, or is, exercised. The superscripts individuate the attributives. In a <br>
perceptual constancy, different attributives marked by different superscripts share a com-<br>
mon <i>representatum</i> (indicant). All ways of plotting <i>cubical</i> in a spatial coordinate system <br>
are ways of indicating and attributing the attribute-type <i>cubical</i>. Every kind of perceptual <br>
attributive response to a significantly different type of proximal stimulus that attributes <br>
<i>cubical</i> is a different attributive, marked by a different superscript.<br>
<br>
A superscripted attributive symbol stands in for the content, hence it determines the <br>
indicant of the attributive. The superscript ‘p1’ signifies attributive content, the mode of <br>
presentation, and that content fixes the indicant <i>cubical</i>. It is impossible for a superscript, <br>
given its psychological meaning, to be associated with a different word-like symbol, or <br>
different indicant. All the ways of attributing the property <i>cubical</i> are <i>constitutively</i> ways of <br>
indicating and attributing <i>cubical</i>. Each attributive that represents <i>cubical</i> gets its identity <br>
partly from its representation of <i>cubical</i>. By contrast, a word-like symbol does not deter-<br>
mine its superscript. Being in a linkage centered on <i>cubical</i> does not determine a specific <br>
way of indicating or attributing <i>cubical</i>. Perceptual attributives just <i>are</i> ways of indicating <br>
and attributing attributes. A superscript marks a given way.<br>
<br>
Although the word-symbols mark a commonality among linked attributives, they are <br>
not themselves representational elements or units. They alone do not correspond to <br>
at tribu tives. In the intended meaning of the symbolism, no word-symbol could occur (in <br>
standing in for a representational content) independently of a superscript. There are no <br>
canonical—unique, privileged—perceptual attributives for these environmental attributes <br>
at the basic level of perceptual representation. No basic perceptual attributive that repre-<br>
sents <i>cubical</i> does so in a perspective-independent manner. (Chapter 7, the section <br>
Minimalism and Iconic Representation in a Spatial Coordinate <br>
System.) So the word-symbols are not basic semantical components of complex percep-<br>
tual representations. They do not by themselves stand in for perceptual attributives. They <br>
simply mark what attribute is indicated. In this sense, they are a semantical element that <br>
never stands alone. They also mark a competence. They mark a family of attributives, <br>
related in representing the same attribute. This family is the competence underlying link-<br>
age. Part of the competence capable of being exercised in each perceptual attributive is its <br>
competence-linkage to the others.<br>
<br>
This fact differentiates perceptual attributives from Frege’s cases in language and <br>
thought. It is not part of the content of ‘The Morning Star’ that it be linked to ‘The <br>
Evening Star’ in sharing a <i>representatum</i>. They do share a <i>representatum</i>. But it is possible <br>
for their representational contents to be used competently in a psycho-linguistic system <br>
without their being connected psychologically in applying to a single <i>representatum</i>. <br>
Similarly, it is not part of the use and content of mercury that it be linked to the element <br>
with the atomic number 80. By contrast, it is marked in the identity of a perceptual <br>
attributive that its content has a certain attribute as indicant <i>and</i> that attributive is <br>
linked systematically to other attributives with the same indicant. This linkage is shown </div>
