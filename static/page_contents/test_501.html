Richer Perceptual Categorization and Its Processing 501</div>

evidence for stored templates or part-representations and evidence for principles that <br>
work not through stored representations, but through prior probabilities regarding <br>
 features of the shape that supports the super-ordinate categorization.<br>
<br>
Usually this issue is ignored or passed off cursorily. But it is crucial to understanding <br>
whether any sort of stored template operates in more specific categorization. There have <br>
been proposals to produce specific categorization purely on prior probabilities. I conjec-<br>
ture that, ultimately, specific perceptual categorization derives from a variety of computa-<br>
tional tools. Although the problem of understanding the mechanisms of categorization <br>
appears not to be near a solution, serious, interesting work has been done on it.668<br>
<br>
I discuss perceptual memory and perceptual learning in Chapters 16–18. The point here <br>
is that they are integral contributors to later stages of perceptual processing. Both are <br>
perceptual-level. The representations that they process are retentions and normalizations <br>
of perceptual representations. Relevant memory and learning contain only perceptual <br>
attributives, retain perceptual format-structure, and operate in ways that are not more <br>
sophisticated than perceptual operations. They are perceptual-level.<br>
<br>
I have focused here on perceptual-level feedback into the perceptual categorization pro-<br>
cess. I have argued that this feedback is perceptual-level. I take perceptual-level processing <br>
to form the basis for computational explanations and for delineation of the perceptual and <br>
perceptual-motor systems. An analogous point will be developed in Chapters 14 and 15 to <br>
feedback into perceptual processes by endogenous perceptual attention, usually associated <br>
with conative states and task demands. It will be further developed in Chapters 16–17 with <br>
regard to perceptual memory.<br>
<br>
Attention interacts with the categorization cues just discussed. For example, speed and <br>
accuracy of the more specific perceptual categorizations are enhanced when a diagnostic <br>
cue, such as a type of mouth-shape is attended in categorizing an animal-body as a bird-<br>
body. Attention is concentration of resources. Initiation of attention (an attention com-<br>
mand), the attention itself, and attentional effects of an initiation on categorization are <br>
integral aspects of standard visual perceptual-level processing. The fact that memory, <br>
learning, and attention (and initiations of attention) are not themselves perception should <br>
not entice one into the mistake of thinking that they are cognitive or are not key aspects of <br>
the perceptual system. They are perceptual-level capacities. The fact that they can be <br>
caused by antecedent propositional-level capacities does not prevent them from being <br>
part of a perceptual-level computational system.<br><br>
