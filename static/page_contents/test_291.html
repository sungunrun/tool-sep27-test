superscript ‘a’) will apply to the flower, and will itself contribute to the index file that func-<br>
tions fallibly to track the flower. And the memory file will have a referential application <br>
that is not identical with (and has a different subscript from) any of the referential applica-<br>
tions in perception, though apart from splitting, it will initially function (fallibly) to main-<br>
tain the referent of the first visual perception of the flower-body. (Similar points apply to <br>
referential applications to the shape-instance.) Fallibility is marked by differentiating ref-<br>
erential applications with different subscripts.<br>
<br>
Both anaphoric and fallible-tracking connections in memory produce <i>de</i> <i>re</i> memories <br>
of perceived particulars. Neither type of <i>de re</i> element in memory is necessary for all <br>
memory. The bird example invites the assumption of such an element. Perceptual memory <br>
that does not function to be <i>de re</i> is ability-general with respect to past-perceived particu-<br>
lars. All the particulars could be forgotten. The memory would not track any particulars at <br>
all. It would just schematically represent past particulars and track perceptually indicated <br>
attributes from the time of a past perception. (See Chapter 17, the section Ability-<br>
General Long-Term Visual Perceptual Memory.)<br>
<br>
I make only a couple of critical points about Peacocke’s conditions for having temporal <br>
representational content. He writes that having such content<br><br>
is well-founded only if there are actions not fully explained by temporal features of <br>
<br>
 prox imal states, including properties of the time at which a command appears, but are <br>
<br>
explained rather by states of the creature whose content involves duration and the past.<br><br>
He further states these conditions:<br><br>
. . . a representation is given a past-tense label that is sensitive to how much time <br>
<br>
has passed.<br><br>
and<br><br>
. . . consider the individual’s total representational conception at the later time, a total con-<br>
<br>
ception that concerns the state of the world both past and present. This total representa-<br>
<br>
tional conception is one that registers certain identities between objects, events, or places <br>
<br>
that are represented as being a certain way at the earlier time and objects, events, or places <br>
<br>
that are given to the subject at the later time.293<br><br>
The conditions are presented as necessary for having temporal representational content. <br>
I take it that the content might occur within a perception (tracking motion, for example) <br>
or in perceptual memory, as in the bird example. I take these conditions to be applied <br><br>

<b>FOOTNOTES</b><br>
<b>Cont FN</b>293 Peacocke, <i>The Primacy of Metaphysics</i>, 91–95. The use of the term ‘conception’ is jarring. What is preserved <br>
in the attributions of duration under discussion is entirely perceptual. Many attributions of duration occur in <br>
creatures that lack any concepts. Some philosophers take any form of memory to be <i>cognitive</i>. I argue against <br>
such a view in Chapters 16–17 and 19. A further mistake, flatly incompatible with perceptual psychology, would <br>
be to think that temporal properties and relations are not represented in perceptual systems, independently of <br>
conceptions.</div><div id="PGHEADER">
