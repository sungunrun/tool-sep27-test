Perceptual Memory and Consciousness 569</div>

types of perceptual memory are no more advanced representationally, op er ation al ly, or <br>
phylogenetically than perception. They are systems that are essential for the effective use <br>
of perception.<br>
<br>
The representational contents of visual memory differ from those of visual perception <br>
not only in usually being less rich, but in their past-time representations. A perceptual <br>
memory state’s being accurate entails that its attributives are accurate of particulars that <br>
attributives in retained perceptions were accurate of, earlier. Perception functions to rep-<br>
resent on the basis of present stimulation. Its contents are broadly present-tensed. Memory <br>
is past-tensed.<br>
<br>
Of course, there are perceptual memories in non-visual modalities. There are amodal <br>
memories, almost certainly some of which are non-conceptual memories. There are con-<br>
ceptual or propositional memories, both modal and amodal. I focus on visual perceptual <br>
memory because it is by far the most thoroughly studied type of perceptual memory.<br>
<br>
The types of memory that I discuss are all non-cognitive. All are perceptual-level. By <br>
reflecting on their function to retain content from perception, and on the relative sim pli-<br>
city of their mechanisms, one can begin to dissolve instincts to count memory supra-<br>
perceptual representation. Although not more complex or sophisticated than perception, <br>
perceptual memory is more complex and varied than one might realize from pre-<br>
theoretical intuition. I hope to show both the perceptual-level character of perceptual <br>
memory and the marvelous variety and complexity present among various memory sys-<br>
tems. In this chapter I center on short-term types of visual perceptual memory.<br><br>

<b>Perceptual Memory and Consciousness<br><br>
</div>
</b>I assume a distinction deriving from Ned Block, between phenomenal consciousness and <br>
consciousness <i>accessible</i> to higher, cognitive powers.<br>
<br>
<i>Phenomenal Consciousness</i> is the what-it-is-likeness of experience—the feel of a pain or <br>
tickle, the way it is like to smell a burgundy, or the way it is like to have a visual, auditory, <br>
or tactile state, or the way it is like to have an occurrent perceptual belief. Some perceptual <br>
states are phenomenally <i>un</i>conscious. There is no way that it is like to be in them.<br>
<br>
Whether any given phenomenally conscious sensory state is accessible to cognitive <br>
powers is an empirical question. I call a state ‘<i>cognitive-access conscious</i>’ if it is accessible to <br>
a supra-perceptual-level cognitive power, still leaving unspecified exactly what counts as a <br>
cognitive power. I call a state ‘<i>rational-access conscious</i>’ if it is accessible to a system of <br>
propositional attitudes. I call a state ‘<i>retrospective-access conscious</i>’ if it can be retrieved in <br>
conscious form, even if it is stored unconsciously, and regardless of what representational <br>
level it is retrieved from. In humans, rational-access conscious states can normally be <br>
reported. All phenomenally conscious perceptual states are accessible (however mo ment-<br>
ar ily) to the perceiver, <i>in</i> perception.<br>
<br>
It cannot be armchair-assumed that all phenomenally conscious perceptual states are <br>
processed so as to pass into a higher-level representational system, or even a memory sys-<br>
tem. Relations between perception and higher-level systems or memory, are complex.<br>
<br>
Thus it is an empirical question whether a phenomenally conscious perception or per-<br>
ceptual memory is, in whole or in part, accessible to recall, or to introspective verbal <br>
report. Phenomenally conscious perceptions or memories may not be thus accessible. </div>
