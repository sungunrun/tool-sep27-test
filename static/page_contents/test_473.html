Primitive Attribution of Agency 473</div>
<br><br>
Controlled investigation of the distinction between early attributions of the two cat-<br>
egor ies is not advanced or targeted enough to form a firm conclusion. I continue to focus <br>
on primitive agency attribution, understanding that some experiments run it together <br>
with animacy attribution—sometimes consciously, sometimes without noting a <br>
distinction.631<br>
<br>
Given the evolutionary urgency of responding to agents—especially conspecifics, prey, <br>
and predators—, it is plausible that psychologies evolved to push representation of agency <br>
early in processing streams. It is plausible that in organisms of sufficient complexity, <br>
primi tive agency representation is perceptual, and precedes representation of animacy. <br>
Whether an agent is alive or not, or an animal or not, is a less pressing evolutionary ques-<br>
tion. I believe, however, that the issue of whether primitive representation of agency is <br>
<i>perceptual</i> has not been settled.<br>
<br>
There are unconvincing arguments on both sides. Arguments parallel those discussed <br>
about primitive representation of mechanical causation. The fact that primitive represen-<br>
tation is fast, automatic, non-inferential, and sensitive to subtle details does not show it to <br>
be perceptual.632 Primitive perceptually based beliefs have the same properties. A primi-<br>
tive <i>conceptual</i>  attribution of chasing could be triggered only by perception of a trailing <br>
body that heads within a very specific range of directions toward the object, but not neces-<br>
sarily in the most direct “heat seeking” direction.<br>
<br>
The empiricist view that representation of agency and efficiency is too “abstract” to be <br>
perceptual lacks force. Similarly, the fact that representation of agency is associated with a <br>
suite of anticipations, some of which are learned, does not show such representation to be <br>
non-perceptual. The arguments regarding attribution of mechanical causation are reap-<br>
plicable here.<br>
<br>
Some representation of biological motion is thought to be supported in the superior <br>
temporal sulcus in conjunction with lower-level areas of the brain (for example, V1 and <br>
V5) that process elementary motion information. Monitoring direction of gaze, which is <br>
involved in representing sensory relations to potential action targets, is also supported by <br>
activity in the superior temporal sulcus.633 Attribution of biological motion is not itself <br><br>

<b>Cont FN</b>631 An example is B. Scholl and T. Gao, ‘Perceiving Animacy and Intentionality: Visual Processing or Higher-<br>
Level Judgment?’, in M. Rutherford and V. Kuhlmeier eds., <i>Social Perception: Detection and Interpretation of <br>
Animacy, Agency, and Intention</i> (Cambridge, MA: MIT Press, 2013). Scholl and Gao explicitly state (p. 200) that <br>
they do not distinguish representation of animacy from representation of agency—choosing to discuss relevant <br>
evidence as evidence for representation of animacy. Although they purport to, they present no good evidence for <br>
perceptual representation of intentionality or of representation. Their evidence supports attribution of informa-<br>
tion registration and of conative states that are not distinctively representational.<br>
<br>
632 Claims that primitive representation of agency (or animacy) is perceptual that rest on such points are <br>
made in Scholl and Gao, ‘Perceiving Animacy and Intentionality: Visual Processing or Higher-Level Judgment?’.<br>

intentional, as distinguished from functional. One needs further evidence than the article provides to take infants <br>

States?’.</div>
