perception is present-tensed by giving present-tense contrast value with perceptual mem-<br>
ory, which I argued to be a necessary corollary of perception.<br>
<br>
Perceptual representation of motion or other change requires temporal representation. <br>
One might infer that perception must represent time. But <i>must</i> all perceivers be capable of <br>
representing motion or change in a given perception? There are snapshot-like agnosias <br>
that involve perception in human beings. I think it possible for an organism to have color <br>
constancy, thus perception, but never perceive anything as changing. Suppose that if the <br>
organism perceives one of a range of color shades, it opens its shell to receive nutrients. <br>
Suppose that if it perceives one of a different range of color shades, it closes its shell and <br>
does not respond to stimuli or goes to sleep. Suppose that the organism is not equipped to <br>
see color-change or motion. Its perceptions are snapshot-like.276 Have we just supposed an <br>
impossibility? I doubt that there are any perceivers that cannot perceive motion or other <br>
change. These phenomena are so basic to evolution that it is doubtful that any surviving <br>
perceiver cannot perceive them in some rudimentary way. However, our question is not <br>
whether all actual perceivers are capable of perceiving motion or other change. The ques-<br>
tion is whether by its nature perception must be capable of representing motion or change. <br>
Scientists are entitled to ignore such a question. Thinking about it can, however, deepen <br>
understanding. That is my aim.<br>
<br>
I do not discern anything impossible—anything that goes against the very nature of <br>
perception—in the example, as described. It is a necessary feature of any world that <br>
contains perceivers, that there is change in that world. Perceptual states are sensory <br>
states, and sensory states are produced causally. Causal production is a change. However, <br>
it does not follow from a perceptual state’s being itself a change that a perceptual state <br>
must represent change. By opening our eyes, seeing an unchanging scene, and closing <br>
them again, we sometimes perceive without perceiving change. It is at best unclear why <br>
a being could not have perception and be incapable perceiving anything more than I just <br>
described.<br>
<br>
So I provisionally think that the example cites a possibility. I assume that if representa-<br>
tion of time is constitutively necessary to perception, it is not because perception must be <br>
able to represent motion or other change—however basic such representation is to actual <br>
perception.<br>
<br>
The example suggests that perception does not constitutively require spatial represen-<br>
tation. Although all or nearly all organisms with visual perception have spatial percep-<br>
tion, it seems to me that it is metaphysically possible that there be organisms that perceive <br>
only color and do not place it in 3-D space. Even visual perception of a color patch will <br>
likely induce a minimum directional 2-D part–whole structure on the patch—left to <br>
right, up to down. (See Chapter 9, the section Part–Whole Representation in <br>
Pictures and Visual Perception.) But registration of direction does not in itself <br>
yield spatial representation. What would, or might, be missing would be 3-D spatial <br>
representation.<br>
<br>
The argument in <i>Origins of Objectivity</i> aimed to show that temporal representation is <br>
constitutive to perception by showing that being linked to perceptual memory is constitu-<br>
tive to perception. The argument was as follows.<br><br>
