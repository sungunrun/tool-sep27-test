672 Perception and Cognition</div>
<br><br>
Cognition is usually understood as a process of transforming an informational input <br>
<br>
which already has some level of unification (in the case of visual input, e.g. a percept) by <br>
<br>
psychological processes like learning, memorizing, imagining, attending, considering, <br>
<br>
decision making, linguistic expression, etc.1098<br><br>
Since perceptual representations, which have “some level of unification”—for example, a <br>
perception as of a rectangular surface—, are commonly transformed into other percepts—<br>
for example, a percept as of a 3-D volume shape—, the explication rests entirely on the <br>
idea of being “like” the listed types of processes. No explication of how these processes are <br>
alike is given. No distinction among different types of learning or memory . . . is taken to be <br>
relevant. So it is just assumed that any instance of learning, remembering, imagining, <br>
anticipating, attending, imagining, conation (“decision making”), is an instance of <br>
cognition.1099<br>
<br>
The weakness of this view is evident with simple types of “remembering”, such as trans-<br>
saccadic memory. This type does “transform” percepts. On the view under criticism, any <br>
role for such a memory state counts as cognition. I take this point to be a <i>reductio</i> of the <br>
explication. Trans-saccadic perceptual memories are not perceptual states. They are not <br>
thereby cognitive (supra-perceptual-level) states. This usage of ‘cognition’ retards under-<br>
standing of mental kinds.<br>
<br>
As indicated in Chapters 14–18, conation, attention, memory, anticipation, learning, <br>
imagining should not be counted supra-perceptual, without qualification. Each generic <br>
capacity operates at different specific representational levels. Lumping psychological states <br>
that are not perceptions into a category of cognition is, I think, a paradigm of confused <br>
thinking about mind.<br>
<br>
Sometimes, simplest versions of the inference from being representational and non-<br>
perceptual to being cognitive are qualified. Taking emotion <i>per se</i> to be a type of cognition <br>
has been balked at.1100 Sometimes attention is exempted (but with no distinction between <br>
attention and attention commands). No attempt at theoretical clarification follows.<br>
<br>
One could <i>stipulate</i> that a capacity that is not a perceptual capacity is cognitive. The <br>
stipulation would hinder insight into natural psychological kinds. We already know that <br>
perception is a kind. What unifies the others? I am taking it as a condition on cognition <br>
that it is a higher-level, more knowledge-like kind of representation than perception. Most <br>
writers assume this condition. The assumption would be at odds with the stipulation. To <br>
take another example, visual sensory memory is a mechanical retention of perception. It <br>
derives from no processing. Visual sensory memory is clearly not a higher level of repre-<br>
sentation than perceptual representation. The point applies to many other types of memory.<br>
<br>
Some authors elaborate the “beyond-here-and-now” idea. Non-perceptual representa-<br>
tion is sometimes claimed to be more “abstract” than perception. This claim trades on the <br>
old empiricist idea that I have repeatedly criticized. Perceptual representation itself can be <br><br>
