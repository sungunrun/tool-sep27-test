Perceptual Anticipation 639</div>
<br><br>
To illustrate how far a discussion can get from the original distinction that Tulving drew <br>
between ability-general (schematic) memory and <i>de re</i> memory of events (and the associ-<br>
ated distinction for anticipation), I describe a prominent, otherwise useful essay. Thomas <br>
Suddendorf and Michael Corballis discuss whether non-human animals can engage in <br>
mental time travel—to the past in episodic memory, or the future in anticipatory refer-<br>
ence.1017 They conclude that they cannot. After introducing Tulving’s taxonomy, they pro-<br>
pose conditions for mental time travel. Initially, they distinguish ‘knowledge extracted’ <br>
from a past experienced event from having access to a ‘personally experienced event’. They <br>
write, ‘Episodic memory is not about <i>regularities</i>, but about reconstructing <i>particularities</i> <br>
of specific events that happened to the individual’. This <i>is</i> an important distinction, <br>
although introduction of reconstruction is not motivated or explained.1018<br>
<br>
The emphasis on reconstruction gets things backwards. Perception starts with repre-<br>
sentation of particulars. Such reference need not be reconstructed in memory—it can just <br>
be retained by relying on causal chains that support the reference. Schematic memory of <br>
regularities derives from <i>loss</i> of ability to track and use specific causal chains to perceived <br>
particulars.<br>
<br>
Once the idea of reconstruction takes hold, the authors expand it with relish. They <br>
claim that mental time travel is ‘open-ended and generative’, even involving recursive abil-<br>
ities to generate ‘an unlimited applications of rules to create an unlimited set of potential <br>
future scenarios’ (302). They think that the selective advantage of mental time travel is <br>
increased flexibility in acting to secure future needs. They impose a requirement of flexi-<br>
bility and domain generality on a capacity to mentally time travel. In accord with Tulving’s <br>
requirement of self-consciousness, they require a capacity to represent self and others, <br>
through folk psychology (theory of mind), and a capacity to consider oneself ‘in various <br>
alternative versions of future events’ (308). They require a folk physics and rehearsals of <br>
future possible situations.<br>
<br>
It is wildly errant to think that representing particulars in the past or future, even at <br>
long-term time intervals, requires any of these capacities. These capacities are not required <br>
for retaining perceptual representation of particulars in long-term memory, or anticipat-<br>
ing future particulars. Episodic perceptual memory and anticipatory perceptual reference <br>
to particulars in the non-immediate future guides relatively primitive action. They are <br>
perceptual-level competencies.<br>
<br>
Non-human animals certainly have <i>de re</i> representations in at least short-term memory <br>
and short-term anticipation. (See Chapter 16 and earlier parts of this section, particularly <br>
regarding anticipation of motion.) Some animals probably have both conscious and <br>
unconscious varieties. Detailed proposals for testing non-human animal extension of <i>de re</i> <br>
representation into long-term memory and long-term anticipation will remain difficult. <br><br>

<b>FN</b>1018 It is common in the psychology of memory to highlight “constructive” elements in memory—that is, <br>
learning in memory or need-driven biases in memory. Some psychologists claim that it is a mistake to conceive <br>
memory as retaining information. I think that this claim is conceptually confused. If a capacity does not have the <br>
representational function to retain information, however much information may get changed in memory, it is <br>
not memory. Of course, this representational function is compatible with there being psychological functions <br>
that dominate and conflict with it.</div>
