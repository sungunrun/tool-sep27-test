origin for a representational framework by an indexical rule, analogous to the rule for <br>
‘here’ in language.<br>
<br>
Suppose that our sample perception represents the relevant perceived body as being in <br>
a certain location. Location is determined by determining a combination of distance and <br>
direction. Distance and direction are determined from different sets of formation <br>
principles.<br>
<br>
Direction is easily mapped pre-perceptually. It can be determined from the retinal <br>
image alone. Non-perceptual eye-cups that lack lenses and produce no images can register <br>
direction.250 Plants can register direction. Although it is <i>registered</i> more primitively than <br>
distance or ordinal depth, direction is not more fundamental <i>representationally.</i> Visual <br>
representational spatial content does not arise until there is not only direction but depth, <br>
metrical or ordinal. (See Chapter 3, the section Visual Spatial Property and <br>
Relation Constancies.)<br>
<br>
Direction is representationally fixed as a vector in 3-D space from the origin. Distance <br>
is determined along that vector. I represent the combination of distance and direction as <br>
location <i>l</i>. Since <i>l</i> is determined within a spatial framework, it is determined in an ability-<br>
general spatial grid with an origin that is fixed via a referential application of an egocen-<br>
tric index.<br>
<br>
Let <i>o</i> be the origin referred to by the egocentric index. Let here-cego x be the schematic <br>
content that is the general competence to apply a spatial egocentric index to the position <i>o</i> <br>
on the viewer’s body. Let the referent of the representational content of the referentially <br>
applied index here-cego x1 be <i>o</i>. Let ‘LocL’ stand in for a perceptual attributive that indicates <br>
a specific distance and direction of a particular with respect to the origin of a spatial repre-<br>
sentational framework. LocL is a two-place attributive: particular <i>p</i> at-distance-direction-<i>L</i> <br>
with respect to origin <i>o</i>.<br>
<br>
I take the scope of the applied index to be commonly as wide as the scopes of the <br>
widest-scope referential applications in perceptual representational content. The applied <br>
index has such scope not only because it marks a psychologically privileged origin, but <br>
also because it is usually common to all the identificatory applications in a given percep-<br>
tion. Normally, it provides a fixed point of reference from which all other points of refer-<br>
ence radiate.<br>
<br>
I idealize here. I assume that the same grid is reapplied with different origins in differ-<br>
ent perceptual states. In reality, matters are not so simple. Given that some perceived <br>
en tities are perceived not as being in specific locations but only as bearing ordinal depth <br>
relations to other perceived entities, parts of the grid may go indeterminate. Where the <br>
indeterminacies of distance lie in the grid might shift with context. As we shall see in <br>
Chapter 15, attention can remap spatial frameworks, sometimes to stretch or contract <br>
them, distorting spatial relations. Frameworks are not always stable from one perceptual <br>
state to another. Still, normal perception can attribute definite distances with some reliable <br>
approximate accuracy, if perceived entities are not too far away.<br>
<br>
I reiterate another important feature of spatial representational frameworks in percep-<br>
tion (shared with temporal representational frameworks). Except for the origin of a spatial <br>
framework, spatial positions are not referred to via referential applications. They are not <br><br>
