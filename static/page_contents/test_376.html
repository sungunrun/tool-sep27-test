detailed, specific shape that causes the more generic shape representations. Different levels <br>
of detail and specificity come into play at different times during processing.<br>
<br>
Evidence strongly suggests, however, that most of these reversals in representation of <br>
ontological taxonomic dependence occur at small temporal scales. For example, in pro-<br>
cessing that lasts 150–300 ms—before any saccadic shift in fixation point—both more <br>
generic and quite specific shape representations are normally computed. Several levels of <br>
shape representation are computed although more generic levels are computed micro-<br>
seconds before the most specific levels. Similarly, detail in motion representation takes <br>
longer than generic motion features. Most <i>detailed</i> motion representation takes longer <br>
than representation of color or depth.<br>
<br>
In any case, different levels of abstraction and resolution in perceptual content come <br>
into play at different times in the formation of perceptual representations. Perceptual rep-<br>
resentational contents vary over very short temporal intervals.<br>
<br>
Fifth, there is room for some recurrent-processing effects, from attention and memory, <br>
even on the earliest stages of perception-formation.<br>
<br>
First, attention. Attention to a task both in advance of stimulus onset and during pro-<br>
cessing affects visual processing. Advance attention affects earliest cortical stages of first-<br>
pass processing, in brain area V1. Neural sensitivity to, and perceptual representation of, <br>
spatial resolution, orientation, direction of motion, texture, and depth are all enhanced by <br>
attention to a specific task involving registration or representation of these attributes.395 <br>
Representation of some attributes, such as location and general topography, are either not <br>
affected or are less affected.<br>
<br>
Second, memory. Effects of past perceptions can affect neural, registrational, and repre-<br>
sentational sensitivity to these same attributes, even in first-pass V1. For example, percep-<br>
tion of motion in a certain direction in the immediate past can enhance, by priming, <br>
sensitivity to that sort of motion in V1.396 These changes constitute unconscious percep-<br>
tual learning, or at any rate, improvement in perceptual capacity through past <br>
perceptions.<br>
<br>
This interaction between perception and memory should be sharply distinguished from <br>
interaction that occurs between a perception and a stored memory in the process of form-<br>
ing another perceptual representation. It is important to distinguish (a) the case in which <br>
mem ory has already affected the way the perceptual system responds to a given stimulus <br>
from (b) the case in which perceptual processing <i>in mediis rebus</i> makes use of contents in <br>
a memory system to yield a new perceptual state. Earliest formation stages are affected by <br>
(a). Clear examples of (b) in earliest perception are either absent or less prominent. As we <br>
shall see, examples of (b) are prominent in perceptual processing just after first-formed <br>
perception.<br><br>
