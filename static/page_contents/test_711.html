 conscious (or explicit) from unconscious (or implicit) systems. Consciousness and uncon-<br>
sciousness do distinguish psychological capacities. But that distinction runs across all psy-<br>
chological capacities—perceptual-level capacities, propositional capacities, and so on. <br>
Often, unconscious capacities are taken to have some or all these features: automatic, <br>
default use, low-effort, fast, parallel, high capacity, and universal across a species. Often, <br>
conscious capacities are taken to have some or all of the contraries: controlled, inhibitory, <br>
high-effort, slow, serial, low capacity, and learned individually.<br>
<br>
None of these points is precise.1163 Many are not <i>generally</i> valid. If ‘automatic’ implies <br>
<i>computational</i>, some unconscious processing is computational; some is not—or is not <br>
known to be. Not all conscious thought is controlled by individuals. Some conscious pro-<br>
cedures are default. Some unconscious processing is inhibitory. Attention—probably a <br>
feature of all psychological systems—always has both default and inhibitory functions. <br>
Unconscious processing does tend to proceed without effort, but conscious processing <br>
(fast, habitual, conscious associations or inferences) can occur without effort. Some <br>
unconscious processing is slow—some associative learning, for example. Many uncon-<br>
scious processes are parallel; many are serial—certain aspects of visual search, and some <br>
applications of spatial attention or object attention (in both perceptual-level and prop os-<br>
ition al capacities), for example. Conscious visual search, both in a perceptual system and <br>
in a system of belief guided by perception, can be parallel or serial. Unconscious capacities <br>
tend to carry higher information loads. But unconscious processing in multi-object track-<br>
ing and probably various types of unconscious propositional inference have small infor-<br>
mation capacities. Conscious visual perception and conscious visual perceptual belief, <br>
though not processes, have large information capacities. Availability to conscious long-<br>
term memory retrieval—propositional-level and perceptual-level—connects to a huge <br>
storage capacity, although not as large as the overall capacity of long-term memory, much <br>
of which was unconsciously fed and is not consciously retrievable. All psychological sys-<br>
tems are a mix of innate and acquired features.<br>
<br>
Similarly, various psychologists have tried to distinguish unconscious (“system one”) <br>
systems from conscious (“system two”) systems by functional or representational charac-<br>
teristics. System one is supposed to be associative, domain specific, contextualized, heuris-<br>
tic. System two is supposed to be rule-based, domain general, abstract, logical. Again, <br>
these generalizations are too imprecise and approximate to yield detailed insight. At both <br>
conscious and unconscious levels, perceptual systems have both associative and rule-<br>
based features, as do systems of thought. Association is itself domain general, and systems <br>
of perceptual-belief formation are domain specific. Although perceptual-level systems do <br>
not generalize via quantification, their attributives can be very abstract or generic. <br>
Proposition-level systems can be both highly contextualized and abstract. Heuristic pro-<br>
cedures are present in all psychological systems. Although logic shows up only in systems <br>
of thought, it can be applied both consciously and unconsciously.<br><br>

<b>FN</b>1163 In fairness, many works cited in the preceding footnote do not present general models of psychology. <br>
Many apply dual system models only to “reasoning”. Even so, there remains a lack of precision and a tendency to <br>
over-generalize about distinguishing characteristics. Of course, some of the difficulty derives from the fact that <br>
psychological models for higher-level capacities are not very advanced, because of the subject matter’s complex-<br>
ity. I return to discuss the models as bases for better understanding of the notion of cognition in the next section.</div>
