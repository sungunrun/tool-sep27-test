630 Perceptual Learning, Anticipation, Imagining</div>
<br><br>
Perceptual learning is a development that is guided by recurrent processing, which begins <br>
<br>
at high-level areas of the visual system. When these inputs do not suffice for learning, and <br>
<br>
perhaps when they are not needed, learning progresses backwards to the input levels.993<br><br>
Whether or not this hypothesis is correct, there is evidence that learning occurs at both <br>
perceptual and pre-perceptual levels. Of course, there is conceptual learning as well. So <br>
learning, like conation, memory, and attention, occurs at various levels. No account of <br>
cognition that contrasts cognition with perception can reasonably claim that all learning is <br>
cognitive.<br><br>

<b>Perceptual Anticipation<br><br>
</div>
</b>I believe that in all animals that have perception, perception is paired with perceptual <br>
memory and perceptual anticipation. Representational memory preserves perception. <br>
Perceptual anticipatory representation projects perception. The projection can be auto-<br>
matic and unconscious. It can be caused by simple associational mechanisms. It can be the <br>
result of innate tendencies, conditioning, or learning. These three psychological functions— <br>
perception, memory, and anticipatory representation—coordinate in sharpening and <br>
enriching perception and in supporting action. Insofar as memory and anticipation serve <br>
only perception, perceptual recognition, or perception-driven action, they are rightly <br>
regarded as perceptual-level, and pre-cognitive.<br>
<br>
Visual perceptual anticipatory representation represents, in visual format, anticipated <br>
future situations. Commonly, visual anticipation is fed by visual memory. Visual anticipa-<br>
tion is crucial to perception-guided action in many animals, including humans. Usually <br>
the anticipated situations are represented as being at some relatively specific time-period <br>
forward from the present. A lion can visually represent how a particular impala will look, <br>
when it will emerge from a copse of trees, and what its trajectory, speed, and position will <br>
be when it does so.<br>
<br>
Anticipatory representation associates with perception in many ways. For example, it <br>
derives from past stimuli held in memory—including both purely perceptual patterns and <br>
past rewards associated with them. A literary description that well captures the phe nom-<br>
enon is Elena Ferrante’s remark,‘…sometimes a . . . connection is established between our <br>
mental circuits and the events whose echo is about to reach us’.994<br>
<br>
In reflecting on anticipation, one must firmly distinguish factors that are merely dis-<br>
posed to affect future representation from anticipatory representation. The distinction is <br>
between states (including but not limited to representational states) that merely function <br>
to affect future representation and states that function to do so by representing, <br><br>

pre-perceptual sensory registrations are needed—and perhaps those resources are the only ones used—mo tiv ates <br>
my amendment. I have in mind the learning traced in Dosher’s elegant series of articles, beginning with Dosher <br>
