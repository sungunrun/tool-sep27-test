degrees, with a sensory state. All those attributes functionally and recurrently associated <br>
with causation are informationally registered.<br>
<br>
What partly distinguishes perception from information registration is that only some of <br>
the causes in this welter count in determining the basic type of perceptual state-kind that <br>
grounds causal explanation of its formation. The main thing to focus on is the selection of <br>
types of causes in the determination of perceptual-state kinds.<br>
<br>
Certain specific causes in the distal environment become selected causes, or factors, in <br>
the chain of causes. Success in perception hinges on representing specific causes or causal <br>
factors. Others in the causal chains are sensed, or at least informationally registered. These <br>
others are not perceived. Distal environmental cause-types are basic for determining per-<br>
ceptual state kinds, because they are the main macro-biological molders of perceptual <br>
states. They are the environmental types most relevant to understanding co-option of <br>
accuracy by evolution—and the level most relevant to understanding individuals’ actions <br>
and reactions to the world.<br>
<br>
The main ground for believing the foregoing is the explanatory success of science— <br>
specifically psychophysics. This science is distinctive in that it identifies states by their <br>
conditions for being veridical with respect to the environment. It tracks states’ success <br>
and failure in meeting those conditions not just in its explanations of biological functions <br>
of organisms’ states, but in the causal laws that it postulates to explain occurrence of <br>
such states.<br>
<br>
Law-like causal explanation of non-perceptual sensory states is most systematic and <br>
unified if it begins with a proximal stimulus. Nothing in such explanation need advert to <br>
antecedent environmental causes that produced the stimulus. Of course, causal ex plan-<br>
ation can be traced all the way out. But systematic causal understanding of how the <br>
 non-representational sensory states work is not enhanced by doing so. Such states can be <br>
<i>causally</i> understood by understanding their causal relations to the proximal stimulus and <br>
their causal relations to subsequent states in the organism’s body. <i>Functional</i> understand-<br>
ing of such states requires understanding their relations to the macro-environment in <br>
which they evolved.<br>
<br>
With perceptual psychology, there emerges a different type of law-like causal ex plan-<br>
ation that specifies sensory-state kinds partly in terms of types of potential causes in the <br>
distal environment. A sensory state is specified as a representation of a 3-D volume shape, <br>
for example. Certain distal causes are the selected types of causes mentioned three para-<br>
graphs back. The new type of causal explanation marks a new type of competence that <br>
grounds it.<br>
<br>
What lies at the heart of the new competence is perceptual constancy—the capacity to <br>
perceptually represent a given attribute or particular as that attribute or particular despite <br>
significant differences in proximal stimulation. Perceptual states are what they are partly <br>
by virtue of their responding to aspects of the proximal stimulus that cue presence of spe-<br>
cific distal attributes or particulars. This process of objectification—of utilizing proximal <br>
stimuli to yield specifications of a specific distal stimulus in many different stimulus <br>
 circumstances—is the selection process that makes perceptual sensing more focused and <br>
specific than non-perceptual sensory information registration. Perceptual constancies <br>
ground perceptual states’ having specific accuracy conditions—conditions that set what <br>
perceptual states selectively represent, and what circumstances make perceptual states ful-<br>
fill their new representational functions.</div>
