anticipatorily, the future. The latter are the future oriented analogs of memory states that <br>
represent the past. I count both types <i>perceptual anticipation</i>. But the first type does not <br>
<i>represent</i> the future.<br>
<br>
Although both types bear on the nature of perceptual attributives, the first type consti-<br>
tutively determines the natures of some perceptual attributives. For example, the differ-<br>
ence between a visual perceptual attributive for generic shape (shape with a closed outer <br>
boundary) and a visual perceptual attributive for body that <i>has</i> such a shape can reside in <br>
the fact that having the latter attributive consists partly in having a disposition to percep-<br>
tually anticipate persistence of instances of the generic shape over time, allowing tracking, <br>
or an anticipation of solidity if the shape-instance were touched.995 Similarly, the differ-<br>
ence between representation of a surface in 3-D space, and representation of a 3-D shape <br>
can reside in dispositions to anticipate certain sorts of perceptions when the surface is <br>
rotated, or when the perceiver moves.996<br>
<br>
The distinction between perceptual anticipation that does not represent the future and <br>
perceptual anticipation that does is often elided in the scientific literature. It is common to <br>
lump together results of cueing on the earliest sensory receptors in V1, perceptual sets or <br>
Bayesian priors based on statistics of natural images, results of chunking and other sorts of <br>
packaging in long-term memory, memories that are used in recognition, and so on, as <br>
instances of “expectation” or “foreknowledge”.997 All these states affect future representa-<br>
tion in perception, memory, and action. Few represent future events. None are knowledge.<br>
<br>
For example, adaptive or priming effects can reset sensory receptors for subsequent <br>
perceptual processing in the near future. The resetting can operate very early, even on <br>
sensory receptors. Such resettings are often not representations of future events. From <br>
outside the system, they can be said to be changes that anticipate that more of the same <br>
stimulation is coming. However, they are totally unlike expectation or foreknowledge. <br>
Some of the states are not representational at all. Even those that are representational do <br>
not represent the future.<br>
<br>
Effects of adaptation and priming are settings that either reduce or heighten sensitivity <br>
to certain subsequent sensory input. The settings function to sensitize the system to a <br>
probability that the next input will be similar to the immediately previous inputs. These <br>
settings have an anticipatory function. They can be called ‘perceptual anticipation’. They <br>
should be distinguished from perceptual-level anticipatory representation of the future. <br>
To count even the latter as prediction or foreknowledge would be to confuse representa-<br>
tional levels.<br>
<br>
Such confusion is rife in the scientific literature, where talk of prediction and fore-<br>
knowledge is common. It also shows up in work of some philosophers who are enthusiasts <br>
for talk about brains as predictive machines, or for talk about the visual system as a self-<br>
correcting proto-scientist. I criticize such views below. Here I simply remark that meta-<br>
phor often replaces clear-headed thinking. Careless usage obscures psychological kinds. <br>
Prediction and foreknowledge necessarily represent the future. Many states in the <br><br>
