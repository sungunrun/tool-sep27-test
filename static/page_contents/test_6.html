<br><br>
Philosophical tradition has come to a broad consensus on the most general marks of <br>
mind. They are <i>consciousness</i> and <i>representation</i>.4 Thought and perception—both of which <br>
are types of representation—can be conscious or unconscious. Consciousness, I think, <br>
can be either representational or not. A representational state like a perception can, <br>
 obviously, be conscious. A feel of a pain or a tickle can, I think, be distinguished from a <br>
proprioceptive representation of its location. Such feels are conscious, but not in them-<br>
selves representational in the ordinary sense of representation—the sense that I will refine <br>
and develop.<br>
<br>
This book focuses on representation, not consciousness. I take perceptual representa-<br>
tion to be a basic mark of mind and a mark of nature’s mind–mindless joint. This view <br>
does not compete with the idea that consciousness is also a basic mark of mind. There may <br>
be two joints in nature between minds and the mindless. Most minds are both representa-<br>
tional and at some times conscious. But it may be that there are conscious beings that do <br>
not represent and representational beings that are not conscious. I focus on the first mark <br>
of mind—representation. Vastly more is known about it. The science of consciousness is <br>
in its gestation stage. The science of perceptual representation is in its early maturity.<br>
<br>
There is no consensus about how consciousness and representation are related in being <br>
marks of mind. The issue is complicated by the fact that there are importantly different <br>
historical understandings of the putative subject matter here—mind. The notions of mind, <br>
psyche, soul, psychological system, and so on each have different historical associations. <br>
I ignore nuance here, in the interests of providing a broad-brushed setting for the main <br>
project. I think that having consciousness and having representation are each sufficient for <br>
having a mind.<br>
<br>
Neither is by itself necessary for having a mind. An animal that feels pain—and hence is <br>
conscious—has a mind. It may or may not have a capacity to represent, in the sense <br>
of ‘represent’ that will occupy us. For example, it may or may not have perceptual states. <br>
An animal that perceives, and hence represents, has a mind. It may or may not be capable <br>
of consciousness.<br>
<br>
So I think that representation and consciousness are in principle separable. Each is a <br>
mark of mind.5 It follows that there could be two paths to mind in the evolution of <br>
 animals—one through consciousness, one through representation. If one wants to dis-<br>
tinguish mind—marked by consciousness—from psychology—marked by representation, <br>
I have no strong objection. Then there may be minds without psychologies, and psycholo-<br>
gies without minds. I do not, however, write in these ways. I do sometimes write of con-<br>
scious mind or representational mind.<br>
<br>
I assume that the two marks of mind—consciousness and representation—are each suf-<br>
ficient for having mind. Having at least one necessary. Neither is by itself necessary.<br>
<br>
Of course, many animals that are conscious are capable of representation, and many <br>
animals capable of representation are conscious. All higher animals, certainly all <br><br>

<b>FOOTNOTES</b><br>
<b>Cont FN</b>4 What I call ‘representation’ is often called ‘intentionality’. I think that the latter term is historically associated <br>
with unclear thinking about representation, and is best discarded. I mean ‘representation’ here in a specific <br>
restricted sense, developed in Chapter 2.<br>
5 One could qualify these points. Consciousness is historically more closely tied to the notion of mind. <br>
Representation is more closely tied to the notion of psychology. Some may find saying that an always uncon-<br>
scious animal has a mind is harder than saying that it has a psychology. Some may find that saying that an ani-<br>
mal, that feels pain but represents nothing, has a psychology is harder than saying that it has a mind, though not <br>
<i>much</i> of a mind. One could talk of conscious mind and representational mind to ease the rub. I sometimes do so.</div>
