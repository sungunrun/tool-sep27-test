474 Primitive Attribution of Causation, Agency</div>

attribution of agency. Moreover, this same brain area supports many other operations <br>
(including speech perception, face perception, other types of social perception, and <br>
 integration of hearing and vision). There is no certainty that it does not support supra-<br>
perceptual attributions, or that attribution of agency does not depend on other areas, <br>
including areas that support conceptual attributions. For example, areas that support <br>
functional and anticipatory dispositions that are necessary for having agency representa-<br>
tion may be contributed by other areas. Whether these responses are perceptual or con-<br>
ceptual is part of what is at issue—even granted that responses to biological motion are <br>
perceptual.<br>
<br>
A further study tries to home in on action attribution. Lower-level motion-perception <br>
areas, such as MT+ (an amalgam of the middle temporal area, MT, and the medial su per-<br>
ior temporal area, MST) are reported to underlie responses to the motion and shape orien-<br>
ta tion involved in chasing.634 Specific types of motion and shape orientation, associated <br>
with attribution of chasing and threatening, seem to be grounded in uncontroversially <br>
visual perceptual areas of the brain.<br>
<br>
The basic issue remains. Perceptual attributions of distinctive motion-and shape orien-<br>
ta tion cue agency attribution. Such attributions are surely formed because of their connec-<br>
tion to agency, but are not agency representations. Functional dispositions to respond to <br>
these cues are central. The dispositions are essential to differentiating agency representa-<br>
tion from motion/spatial-relation/bodily-shape representation. Are the dispositions <br>
 perceptual or supra-perceptual?<br>
<br>
As far as I know, neurophysiological investigation of these functional responses has not <br>
been undertaken.635 More studies tracking more factors in agency attribution would be <br>
valuable in supporting or disconfirming the view that primitive attributions of agency are <br>
perceptual.<br>
<br>
Attribution of biological motion and other types of joint relations between different <br>
bodies is certainly perceptual. Since such motions are grouped as special largely because <br>
they signal agency, it is plausible that when supported by functional anticipations, attribu-<br>
tion of biological motion and relevant spatial configurations triggers perceptual attribu-<br>
tions of agency.636<br>
<br>
Some neural evidence suggests that primitive attribution of agency is perceptual. The <br>
application base for attribution of both animacy or agency is clearly attribution of shape <br>
or motion. Detailed analyses of neural patterns underlying what is commonly taken to <br>
be attribution of animacy shows that the patterns cannot be fully accounted for as shape <br>
 patterns (or, in other cases, motion patterns).637 What is often taken to be primitive attri-<br><br>

that support motor-commands in the mirror-neuron tradition. See, for example, N. Oosterhof, A. Wigget, <br>

psychophysically precise enough to show that the vision-based representations as of actions are perceptual, <br>
though they are suggestive.<br>
