738 Conclusion</div>
<br><br>
The new <i>functions</i> were representational success—accuracy, and its specific subsidiary <br>
sub-types, reference and attribution. The new functions carry with them new <i>norms—<br>
</i>standards for complete success, approximate success, contribution to success, and so on.<br>
<br>
The new <i>form</i> is the form of a noun-phrase-like representational content, with one or <br>
more (usually many, many more) applied referential applications dominating attributives <br>
that guide and are applied via the referential applications.<br>
<br>
All these elements rest on and make use of the natural causal relations of the underlying <br>
sensory states to the environment and on mirroring, in both content and form, the pat-<br>
terns in the environment by which they were molded. The format of perceptual represen-<br>
tation co-opts the iconic format of pre-representational sensory information registration.<br><br>

<b>Empirical Characteristics of First-Formed Perceptions<br><br>
</div>
</b>Currently, the simplest perceivers are arthropods. The main state-kinds, competencies, <br>
functions, and forms discussed in the previous section are constitutive to perception. So <br>
they show up in these creatures, and in perceivers among their evolutionary ancestors.<br>
<br>
I focused on human vision, more particularly on first-formed perceptual states in pro-<br>
cessing sequences. These states form at astonishing speeds. In humans, the first spatial <br>
perceptual constancies probably supported in V4, at approaching a twentieth of a second <br>
from proximal-stimulus onset. First categorizations based on spatial constancies emerge <br>
at about the same time, in V4 and IT. This formation is automatic, and dominantly feed-<br>
forward. Although perceptual states may always involve some attention—some selective <br>
orientation of resources—, there are perceptual representations formed at these speeds <br>
that occur in unattended parts of the perceptions. First-formed perceptions are sketch-like. <br>
Shapes that they represent are relatively generic. Insufficient high-frequency information <br>
is available to yield detail.<br>
<br>
A natural speculation is that the first 24–100 ms, or at latest 60–100 ms of processing, <br>
which forms the first perceptual states, is the torso of an ancient representational system <br>
in extinct ancestors of modern animal perceivers. Whether these first-formed perceptions <br>
are conscious is unknown. Informed conjecture suggests that they may not be, although <br>
conscious counterparts that represent the same generic features, in more detail, are <br>
 certainly formed quickly in us.<br>
<br>
Philosophy has suffered through almost three decades of ungrounded armchair <br>
attempts to understand “the” role of consciousness in perception. Consciousness has <br>
been claimed to be necessary for perception, or necessary for perceptual reference, or <br>
necessary for demonstrative reference in thought based on perception. None of these <br>
claims is correct.<br>
<br>
Consciousness is most vivid in sustained perception. Such perception has advantages of <br>
the filling-in of detail associated with the second and third waves of supplemental <br>
processing.<br>
<br>
It is well-known, however, that conscious illusions can occur while unconscious percep-<br>
tual representation guides action in a way unaffected by illusion.1204 And unconscious <br><br>
