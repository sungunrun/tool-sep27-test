and the relevant tree branch. In receiving the answer, you use a way of perceiving the stick <br>
and its length.<br>
<br>
When one is told the length by ‘this length’, one relies on more than the <i>words</i> literally <br>
and conventionally express. In addition to the singular application of ‘this’ and the at tribu-<br>
tive length, one relies on a perceptual attributive that indicates the specific length. This <br>
indicator is not perspective-free, as the actual length of the stick is (apart from Einsteinian <br>
relativity), and as the specification ‘one meter long’ is. The perceptual attributive indicates <br>
the specific length in a way that plots its position—and those of its discernible parts—in <br>
an egocentrically anchored coordinate system. The basic perceptual specification of the <br>
length uses, essentially, perspective-dependent plottings.<br>
<br>
Many conceptual systems and nearly all linguistic systems use canonical, amodal, <br>
perspective-free specifications of length and shape—2 meters and ‘square’. Some sub-<br>
propositional, supra-perceptual-level psychological systems may use unit-free specifica-<br>
tions of magnitudes. There are modal, object-centered specifications of spatial properties <br>
in perceptual systems. I think that the <i>basic</i> attributives for length and shape in perceptual <br>
systems are unit-free, modal, and perspectival. They <i>consist</i> in plottings in an ego cen tric-<br>
al ly anchored perceptual spatial coordinate system.<br>
<br>
The two illustrations that I have provided support rejecting minimalism and maintain-<br>
ing that basic perceptual attributives are individuated more finely than the indicants of <br>
those attributives. There are many basic perceptual attributives—many different percep-<br>
tual ways of indicating and attributing any given indicant. Each attributive is a different <br>
perceptual capacity with different psychological properties. The considerations so far <br>
given have highlighted non-relational, “intrinsic”, perceiver-independent, spatial proper-<br>
ties of environmental particulars that are perceptually attributed. The considerations high-<br>
lighted non-relational properties like <i>square</i>, <i>cubical</i>, <i>straight</i>, <i>of length l</i>, <i>of size s</i>. I <br>
employed this emphasis because rejecting minimalism is most easily made intuitive by <br>
centering on representations of these types of properties. The illustrations suggest the <br>
huge variety of attributives in any perceptual system for each non-relational spatial prop-<br>
erty. I have, however, explained that the anti-minimalist point applies equally to percep-<br>
tual representation of spatial relations, such as <i>x farther than y from ego-here</i>, <i>x at distance <br>
d from ego-here</i>, <i>x in orientation o with respect to ego-here</i>, <i>x at distance d8</i> <i>from y</i>. For any <br>
given environmental spatial relation that is perceptually attributable in any given percep-<br>
tual system, there are many basic relational attributives that can attribute that relation (or <br>
“relational property”).<br>
<br>
In order to bring out this point more fully, I summarize and develop rejection of min-<br>
im al ism for perceptual spatial attributions in a more general way. Understanding why <br>
minimalism is mistaken here goes close to the heart of understanding perceptual repre-<br>
sentation, with its fundamentally iconic format for realizing perceptual constancies.<br>
<br>
Every normal perceptual state is an enormous complex of referential applications and <br>
perceptual attributions. Any occurrent perceptual state is caused by a specific occurrent <br>
proximal stimulus. The occurrence of the perceptual state is a joint occurrent exercise of <br>
an enormous number of sub-capacities. These sub-capacities are all species of the picking <br>
out capacity—referential applications—or the species of the characterizing capacities—the <br>
attributives. Each attributive is a capacity to indicate and attribute a property (which here, <br>
comprises kinds as well as features) or a relation. Numerous attributives are jointly exer-<br>
cised in any normal, full, occurrent perceptual state.</div>
