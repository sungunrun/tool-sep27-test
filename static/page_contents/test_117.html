from the specific registrational or representational identity of the state or change. All states <br>
and events discussed in the science are individuated in either neural terms or in a com bin-<br>
ation of functional and representational terms.<br>
<br>
Scientific psychological interest in neural patterns lies entirely in their connection with <br>
psychological states with <i>specific</i> representational content. So there is no analog to an <br>
autonomous theory of syntax—a theory of the neural patterns as having grammatical types, <br>
inter-related in a grammatical structure independent of any specific content. The patterns <br>
are of scientific interest purely in their role of making possible, and perhaps in some loose <br>
sense being vehicles of, specific representational contents of psy cho logic al states.<br>
<br>
Of course, as my development of the representational form of perception will indicate, <br>
one can abstract a logical or syntactical form from representational contents. (See Chapters <br>
2, 6–8.) Such form is not individuated—is not what it is—independently of its presence in <br>
contentful representational states. It is a form that depends for its identity entirely on the <br>
contentful representational states from which it is abstracted.<br>
<br>
(LOT*) was inspired by Chomsky’s view that the study of linguistic syntax is autono-<br>
mous from the study of semantics for language (which Chomsky tends to treat as not a <br>
science at all). This view is highly controversial in linguistics. I take no position on the <br>
matter, though I lean toward doubt. Perceptual psychology, as distinct from linguistics, <br>
lacks any serious theory of neural analogs of words that are identifiable independently of <br>
their content. It lacks a theory of syntax that is analogous to a theory of linguistic gram-<br>
mar in even appearing (to some) to be autonomous from a theory of representational <br>
form that simply abstracts forms of representational states for articulation. No analog of <br>
a purportedly autonomous syntax occurs in visual psychology. Perceptual states have a <br>
form. But it is a form of contentful states.<br>
<br>
To get an autonomous science of syntax going, or to find that neural accounts provide <br>
the basis for one, one would have to find that patterns of neural firings that correlate with <br>
representational states are similar enough within individuals over time and similar enough <br>
across individuals of the same or similar species to have an analog of the shapes or sounds <br>
of words.<br>
<br>
One would also have to find that in these patterns there are specific formal roles that <br>
correspond to the lexical items and grammatical roles in a grammar. Then perhaps a new <br>
science of autonomous syntax would apply to patterns of neural firings. Currently, there is <br>
no such science. There is no good philosophical or scientific ground to think that such a <br>
science must develop.<br>
<br>
There is a further aspect to the high-wire act. Even supposing that there were a layer of <br>
syntactical, symbolic items whose identities as symbols are independent of their specific <br>
representational content, nothing has been done to show that computations described in <br>
perceptual psychology operate on those items <i>and not on the structures that are currently <br>
individuated in terms of representational competencies</i>.120 The computations described by <br><br>

<b>FOOTNOTES</b><br>
<b>Cont FN</b>120 Chomsky’s work on semantic-independent syntax in linguistics inspired Fodor’s language-of-thought hypoth-<br>
esis. Chomsky thinks that the computations in <i>perceptual psychology</i> are on structures that are not individuated <br>
in terms of their representational properties. Chomsky is driven by his view that, in linguistics, syntax is largely <br>
independent of semantics, and that the “real” science in linguistics is a science of a non-representational struc-<br>
ture. This latter view is controversial even in linguistics. His application of such a view to perceptual psych ology <br>
is wildly out of touch with the science. Chomsky does not support it through any serious account of the science. <br>
Neither Chomsky nor Fodor shows any grip on perceptual psychology, outside of perception of language. (<i>cont.</i>) </div>
