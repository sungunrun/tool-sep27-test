Perceptual Imagining 643</div>
<br><br>
Shepard and Metzler showed subjects pairs of drawings of 3-D asymmetrical shapes. In <br>
each pair, the shape in the right picture was either identical with the shape in the left pic-<br>
ture, except rotated from its position in the left-hand picture, or a mirror image of the <br>
shape in the left picture, also rotated. Subjects were asked to determine as quickly as pos-<br>
sible whether the two shapes were identical except for rotation or, rather, mirror images of <br>
one another. The time needed to answer was consistently proportional to the degree of <br>
rotation. Some subsequent experiments avoided having subjects compare simultaneously <br>
visible pictures, so that a visible rotated shape was to be compared with a remembered <br>
shape.1033 These experiments got the same timing result.<br>
<br>
Shepard offered the following explanation: Subjects form a mental image of one of the <br>
shapes and imagine rotation of the image, to determine whether it could be visualized as <br>
congruent with the other shape. Greater angular disparity requires longer mental-<br>
rotation times.<br>
<br>
Visual imagery is widely termed a type of ‘cognition’. One ground is a simple contrast <br>
between “cognitive psychology” and behaviorism. The acceptance of imagery was a key <br>
step in replacing behaviorism with “cognitive” (representational) psychology. On this con-<br>
ception of cognition, perception counts as cognition. Perception, as well as imagining, <br>
memory, and so on, are studied by cognitive psychology. Perception is itself an embarrass-<br>
ment for behaviorism.<br><br>
