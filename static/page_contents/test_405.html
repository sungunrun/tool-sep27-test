Two Types of First-Formed Perception 405</div>

Campbell and followers make commitments well beyond what can be found in <br>
Treisman’s work.483 Much of their confidence that attention is necessary for reference to <br>
perceived objects derives, however, from relying on Treisman’s work. Recalibration is <br>
needed. Perceptual reference to objects, involving categorizations of specifically shaped <br>
bodies, is formed rapidly in a largely feed-forward way, with no specific dependence on <br>
attention. Transient attention is drawn to perceived objects. Attention is not necessary for <br>
perceptual representation of “bound” properties. Similar <i>conceptual</i> attributions of shape, <br>
location, and shaped-bodies, and more sophisticated conceptual attributions, are formed <br>
unconsciously and almost as quickly as perceptual attributions, piggybacking on them. No <br>
attention is necessary for their formation either, although both perception and conception <br>
can certainly be informed by attention.<br><br>

<b>Two Types of First-Formed Perception<br><br>
</div>
</b>Here I begin to describe some of what is known about categorization of bodies and other <br>
objects through shape-size, in very brief stimulus exposures and very fast perceptual pro-<br>
cessing. What are first-formed perceptual representations like? What are the earliest and <br>
simplest first forms of mind like? How are they processed?<br>
<br>
There appear to be at least two parallel and somewhat independent types of content-<br>
processing in the first production of perceptual states.<br>
<br>
One type yields perception of scene-<i>gist</i>. Formation of attributives that apply to <br>
scene-type is mediated by task demands. First-formed perception of scene-gists relies <br>
mainly on low-frequency spatial information. Such information tends to generate rep-<br>
resentation of the basic spatial layout of a scene, including large shapes and large differ-<br>
ences in depth, together with global features like <i>diverse</i> versus <i>homogeneous</i>, or <i>dense</i> <br>
versus <i>open</i>. Early, dominant computation of low-frequency information can be modi-<br>
fied by task im port ance. High-frequency information in a scene-gist representation can <br>
be boosted and rapidly produced. First-formed representation of scene-gist can include <br>
color information, especially if color is diagnostic of important global scene features. <br>
Scene-gist representation tends, however, to center on spatial aspects of a scene. A <br>
20–30 ms glimpse suffices to generate gist representation well within 150 ms from <br><br>

<b>FOOTNOTES</b><br>
<b>Cont FN</b>483 For examples of philosophers influenced by Campbell, see Smithies, ‘What is the Role of <br>
Consciousness in Demonstrative Thought?’; I. Dickie, ‘Visual Attention Fixes Demonstrative Reference by <br>
Eliminating Referential Luck’, in Mole, Smithies, and Wu eds., <i>Attention: Philosophical and Psychological <br>
Essays</i>. Dickie also rests some conclusions on assumptions about binding that derive from Treisman’s work. <br>
Dickie and Smithies claim that whether demonstrative reference in perceptual thought is possible depends <br>
on whether the thought has a <i>justification</i> grounded in the perception. I think that considerations of <br>
 epistemic warrant or “justification” cannot restrict psychological science. Moreover, being reliably veridical <br>
is a necessary condition on a thought’s being epistemically warranted. Neither perceptual, context-<br>
dependent reference, nor perception-based, demonstrative thought are <i>constitutively</i> reliable, or <i>constitu-<br>
tively</i> warranted. It is certainly possible for a perceptual state and a perception-based <i>de re</i> belief that it <br>
engenders to be formed by a process that is not reliably veridical, even in its normal environment. Perceptual <br>
and perception-based cognitive competencies evolve to meet biological needs. There is no metaphysically <br>
necessary guarantee that meeting such needs requires reliable veridicality in relevant perceptual and cogni-<br>
tive competencies requires reliable veridicality. I discuss these matters at length in Burge, ‘Entitlement: The <br>
Basis for Empirical Warrant’.</div>
