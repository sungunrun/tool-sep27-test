mammals, have representational capacities and are (often) conscious. So if there are, in <br>
evolutionary history, separate streams into mind—animals that are conscious but do not <br>
represent and/or animals that represent but are not conscious—, these two streams flow <br>
back together in more complex animals.<br>
<br>
The point about the separability of consciousness and representation is a very general, <br>
conceptual point. There is no <i>necessary</i> connection between consciousness and <br>
representation.<br>
<br>
The point is not just of general conceptual importance. It bears on understanding the <br>
kind of representation that figures in this book. I have said that, for all we know, there may <br>
be animals that have perception and lack consciousness. Bees and other arthropods have <br>
perception. They may lack consciousness. We do not know enough about consciousness to <br>
settle the question. One day, unconscious robots might be produced so as to have visual <br>
perception.<br>
<br>
I think that perception without even a capacity for consciousness is epistemically, meta-<br>
physically, and nomologically possible. Epistemically: I think that nothing that we know, <br>
either empirically or apriori, rules out perceptual representation without consciousness <br>
(or vice-versa). Metaphysically and nomologically: I think it a real possibility that an ani-<br>
mal have perceptual representation and lack any capacity for consciousness. Representation <br>
is primarily a functional matter. It hinges on what an individual or the individual’s sub-<br>
systems can do. Consciousness is not a functional matter; it hinges on an individual’s <br>
material basis.<br>
<br>
Psychophysical explanations posit human perceptual states that are not and cannot <br>
become conscious.6 Much of the science of perception is carried on without specifying <br>
whether a perception is conscious. These points form the ground for the conjecture that <br>
there is nothing in the nature of things that requires some association between conscious-<br>
ness and representation.<br>
<br>
Of course, conscious perceptions are an interesting topic. They have different <br>
psychological-representational, as well as phenomenological, properties from uncon-<br>
scious ones. But consciousness itself is not yet a central scientific topic. Perceptual science <br>
has been spectacularly successful without theorizing much about it. Eventually, more will <br>
be known.<br>
<br>
Some philosophers claim that perception must be conscious. Some claim that percep-<br>
tion that picks out bodies, or perception that is not guesswork and could support know-<br>
ledge, requires consciousness. None of the arguments that I know of for such positions has <br>
any force. I discuss some in Chapter 10, the section PhIloSoPhIcal VIewS <br>
InFluenced By TreISman’S BIndIng Theory. Several are incompatible with what <br>
is known from science. Issues about consciousness are not central in our story, but they <br>
arise recurrently. I mention them here both to acknowledge their natural interest and to <br>
motivate not centering on them. My primary focus is representation.<br><br>

<b>FOOTNOTES</b><br>
<b>Cont FN</b>6 For one of many reviews of psychological work that posits unconscious perceptual states, see S. Kouider and <br>
S. Dehaene, ‘Levels of Processing During Non-Conscious Perception: A Critical Review of Visual Masking’, <br>
<i>Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London B</i> 362 (2007), 857–875. When I generalize about vision <br>
science or perceptual psychology, I usually intend psychophysics. Sometimes when I make a point about vision <br>
science, I do not cite specific articles. In such cases, I take the point to be uncontroversial in the science’s main-<br>
stream. Then, I encourage novices to become acquainted with the mainstream, and to check my judgment. I take <br>
the point footnoted in this case to be mainstream-uncontroversial. But since there has been some dissent in <br>
phil oso phy, I give the nod, above, to the scientific literature.</div>
