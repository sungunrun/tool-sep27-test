Visual Working Memory 591</div>
<br><br>
Let us leave these taxonomic issues to consider basic properties of visual working mem-<br>
ory. Its representational form is iconic. Iconic representation in working memory is a <br>
severe selection from the fuller iconic representational content initially presented in per-<br>
ception and retained briefly in the sensory icon and somewhat longer in iconic memory <br>
and FVSTM. Relations between FVSTM and working memory are unclear. Both retain <br>
representations from perception via sensory memory. Relations between trans-saccadic <br>
memory and working memory are also unclear. Some representations from trans-saccadic <br>
memory are often retained in visual working memory.<br>
<br>
A huge amount of work centers on visual perceptual working memory. Most of it has <br>
been conducted on artificial arrays, to control parameters that affect memory. Much of it <br>
should be treated with caution. Memory was formed in response to natural scenes. <br>
Although the laboratory arrays are intended to be simple, they produce impoverished cues <br>
(associated with simple “features”). Many experiments may make the relevant tasks harder <br>
rather than easier.876 Richer experimentation is beginning to alter the picture of visual <br>
working memory that has long been in place. Determining basic features of working <br>
memory is still in its early stages.<br>
<br>
Standard accounts demarcate working memory partly by its access-consciousness. An <br>
unconscious memory system operates beneath the consciously accessible surface—includ-<br>
ing the surface counted working memory. The behavior of working memory in change-<br>
detection and other visual search tasks implies that some visual memory, other than <br>
working memory, routinely retains a much richer sub-part of perceptual representational <br>
content in a way that is <i>not</i> consciously accessible “on demand”. As discussed in Chapter 10, <br>
individuals retain perceptual information about items whose change is not consciously <br>
noticed, or held in access-conscious memory. Retention of the information shows in <br>
behavior. For example, priming shows up over durations much longer than those of visual <br>
sensory memory, FVSTM, or working memory.<br>
<br>
The time course of this unconscious memory is unknown. I think it likely that such <br>
memory feeds, or is an early part of unconscious entry, into long-term memory. The <br>
intense interest in working memory has, I think, led to neglect of this underlying system <br>
of unconscious feeding of long-term memory, and contents of long-term memory that are <br>
not consciously retrievable. The system invites more attention.<br>
<br>
Working memories are formed and consolidated quickly. Depending on the complexity <br>
of the retained representation, formation requires 50–200 ms.877 Unrehearsed working <br>
memory has a longer time course than iconic memory and FVSTM. Without rehearsal, it <br>
decays after about 10–12 seconds. The exact time course remains under investigation.<br>
<br>
Little of what one perceives, on brief exposure, is consciously accessible in visual work-<br>
ing memory. So, little is consciously accessible to verbal report, even just after offset of the <br>
perception, if the exposure is brief and not repeated. Only what is retained in working <br>
memory is consciously accessible “on demand”, after perception, sensory memory, and <br>
FVSTM representations have faded.<br><br>
