sub-unit of a sentence. The sentence is not formed <i>from</i> any such unit. Representational <br>
sub-units in the picture correspond to natural units in usage and understanding. Sub-<br>
units that represent the giraffes are thus grounded. Sub-units that represent leaves in the <br>
background are thus grounded. An alleged sub-unit that represents an amalgam of a <br>
giraffe’s upper half and arbitrary slivers of sky and foliage is not thus grounded. The pic-<br>
ture parses into its natural representational sub-units.<br>
<br>
As indicated, some representational sub-units induce a part–whole structure. For <br>
example, the picture will have sub-units that represent parts of a giraffe’s visible flank’s <br>
surface, as well as sub-units that represent the whole visible surface. The picture has no <br>
sub-unit that represents an amalgam of such a flank part and a part of a background leaf.<br>
<br>
Competencies associated with perceptual, intentional, and conventional patterns in <br>
making and interpreting realist paintings, do not support the idea that every complex part <br>
of the picture is a representational unit. Representational units are determined by psy cho-<br>
logic al use, processes, functions, and competencies. Only picture parts that correspond in <br>
some way to psychological kinds are representational constituents.<br>
<br>
Similar points apply to maps. Suppose that cities larger than a certain size are repre-<br>
sented on a road map by a standard-sized circle. Cut a piece of the map that includes part <br>
of one of the circles, and conjoin it with a non-contiguous, arbitrarily chosen piece also <br>
cut out from the map. The conjunction forms a Goodmanian part of the map. Alternatively, <br>
cut one of the circles in half; then include in the same cut an arbitrary part of the region <br>
contiguous with the circle half. In both cases, one would have map parts that intuitively <br>
map parts of the terrain. Those parts would not be representational units. Representational <br>
units are representations of cities, roads, and spaces between roads—and parts of roads, <br>
spaces, and (sometimes) cities.<br>
<br>
Lines that represent roads represent, iconically, the roads’ lengths and directions. Spaces <br>
between lines map into spaces between roads. Line parts map road parts. Parts of spaces <br>
other than lines and circles map space unoccupied by roads or cities. No map use, percep-<br>
tual capacities, convention, intention, or representational understanding takes com bin-<br>
ations of circle parts with parts of surrounding space as a representational unit, any more <br>
than ‘the dog nuzzled’ is a representational unit. Arbitrary map parts, whether scattered or <br>
contiguous, do not express the conventions or representational competencies that ground <br>
the map’s representational content.<br>
<br>
Analogous points apply to iconic perceptual representation. Perceptual structure is not <br>
determined by intentions, conventions, or understanding. It is determined by perceptual <br>
processes and competencies. The representational units in any iconic perception must <br>
correspond to natural psychological kinds. For example, processing the edge attributive <br>
that represents the boundary of a giraffe’s ear is a different process from the process that <br>
forms representation of the color, or the size and shape, of the tubular bodies (branches) <br>
behind the giraffe. The computation of a representation of the farther-than relation <br>
between the branch-bodies and the giraffe-bodies hinges on forming representations of <br>
giraffe surfaces and branch surfaces. The idea that one can cut representational states and <br>
competencies in perception “any way one likes” is out of touch with the computational <br>
and kind-explanation practices of science. Representational content marks representa-<br>
tional states and competencies. Perceptual states and competencies are explained in <br>
perceptual psychology via principles for forming units of representational content. <br>
