input, and memory are non-revolutionary because they do not affect standard computa-<br>
tional ways of accounting for visual perceptual or perceptual-motor processing.<br>
<br>
The cases are also non-revolutionary in that they do not illumine the nature of psy cho-<br>
logic al kinds, specifically the nature of the perceptual or perceptual-motor system. The <br>
cognitive penetration issue was supposed to be philosophically important in understand-<br>
ing distinctions between perception and cognition, or conception. Proponents of im pene-<br>
tra bil ity saw themselves as upholding and illuminating these distinctions. Some <br>
proponents of penetrability saw themselves as debunking the distinction—showing that <br>
there was a mere continuum, not a distinction in kind between the perceptual and the <br>
cognitive, or the conceptual. Other proponents of penetrability in the stages of perceptual <br>
processing after first-formed perception saw penetration as showing the (pure) visual sys-<br>
tem extended only to some type of early vision.<br>
<br>
Causal influence by propositional states on perceptual processing has turned out to <br>
show less about the nature of the divide between perceptual, or perceptual-level, states and <br>
cognitive-or conceptual level states than it first promised to show. The science treats <br>
perceptual-level states and, at least, conceptual-level states very differently, despite indirect <br>
causal effects from the latter kind of states, even during perceptual-level processing.<br>
<br>
I think that reflecting on scientific causal explanation to understand differences in psy-<br>
cho logic al kinds, like <i>perceptual</i>, <i>conceptual</i>, <i>cognitive</i>, <i>perceptual system</i>, <i>visuo-motor sys-<br>
tem</i>, motivates thinking of perceptual and visuo-motor systems not in terms of immunity <br>
to causal influence while they operate, but in terms of how they operate.<br>
<br>
Strikingly, beliefs and intentions are not included in computational models. Yet the <br>
models explain perceptual processing, perceptual constancies, accuracy, and illusion of <br>
perceptual states—without them. Even when they “drive” attentional or motor commands, <br>
and even when conceptual or propositional memories cause perceptual-level memories <br>
that do affect later stages of perceptual processing, conceptual-level states do not enter <br>
into the computational processes.<br>
<br>
I conjecture that one important aspect of understanding relevant natural psychological <br>
kinds is the fact that conceptual states are not necessary steps in perceptual processing. <br>
New Look theorists took cognitive states, or “concepts” within those states, to be in dis-<br>
pens able steps in forming perceptual states. If that view were right, there really would be a <br>
revolution that would overthrow standard scientific understanding of perception.<br>
<br>
How should we understand the notion of an indispensable step in the formation of <br>
perceptual states? I think that one key is the notion of being an element in—an input <br>
into—a computation.1155 One should be careful here not to assimilate the notion of com-<br>
putation to Fodor and Pylyshyn’s special conception of it. In Chapter 4, the section <br>
Perception, Computation, and the Language-of-Thought Hypothesis, <br>
I rejected the idea that computation in perceptual-motor psychology should be under-<br>
stood as an operation on a <i>content-independent</i> “syntactical” base, a base that is a vehicle of <br>
content that can be understood as a vehicle independently of its content. I do not accept <br>
Fodor’s specific conception of a language of thought in <i>perceptual</i> computation. Perceptual <br>
computations operate not on a content-free syntax, but on instances and types of <br><br>
