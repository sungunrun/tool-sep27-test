as affecting visual processing. The states are in fact perceptual-level.1144 For example, <br>
“knowledge” affects amodal completion, depth from binocular disparity, perceived speed <br>
of motion, color appearance, afterimages. The cases all involve associations stored in per-<br>
ceptual memory or incorporated into priors. None involve applications of knowledge to <br>
perception.1145<br>
<br>
The third handicap that the dispute over impenetrability has labored under is offhand <br>
conceptions of penetration. I cited Pylyshyn’s metaphorical references to quasi-rationality <br>
and logical connections. Much of the literature has followed him in calling for sense-<br>
making contentful connections, or in re-cycling Pylyshyn’s characterizations, or in slip-<br>
ping into unanalyzed catch-phrases like ‘content specific’ causal connections. I discussed <br>
two more serious attempts to characterize the connection in this chapter, the section <br>
Conceptions of Penetration. These also failed to provide much illumination.<br>
<br>
Much of the debate has gone as follows. An opponent of impenetrability cites a putative <br>
case of penetration. Imagining, a motor command, an application of attention, an antici-<br>
pation, or a memory is cited as causally affecting some stage of perceptual processing in a <br>
non-pathological way. The affecting state or event is then counted ‘cognitively driven’. An <br>
unquestionably cognitive state, like a belief or a propositional-level conative state like an <br>
intention, is cited as causing (“cognitively driving”) the intermediary state in a non-<br>
pathological way. The intermediary state may or may not be counted cognitive. The inter-<br>
mediary state is then claimed to have effects on perceptual processing in a non-pathological <br>
way. So the perceptual states or processes are taken to be indirectly causally influenced <br>
(“cognitively driven”) by the paradigmatic cognitive states. Frequently, defenders of <br>
impenetrability show that an attacking claim fails because it overlooks alternative ex plan-<br>
ations or rests on poor methodology. Sometimes a claim of penetrability is counted <br>
un inter est ing, because it does not require significant reinterpretation of scientific under-<br>
standing of the visual system. I focus on cases that elicit this latter response.<br>
<br>
Many opponents of impenetrability advertise their contributions as part of a revolu-<br>
tion—as an exciting, turning-upside-down of the “classical” understanding of vision. <br><br>

“It’s Just X” Fallacy’, <i>Behavioral and Brain Sciences</i> 29 (2016), 40. Lupyan persistently conflates top-down influence <br>
with cognitive influence. The cases he cites all probably depend on recurrent visual processing. All the cited art-<br>
icles confuse conceptual and perceptual categorization, and call the latter ‘knowledge’, without any attempt to <br>
show that the categorization actually rests on belief or propositional memory, as opposed to associational famili-<br>
arity and perceptual processing (perhaps including perceptual memory). These mistakes are residues of <br>
Pylyshyn’s mistakes. The articles also conflate knowledge or belief with familiarity based on association. The <br>
articles fail to show that the experiments depend on the former rather than the latter. Here the articles replicate <br>
the mistake that MacPherson made. Lupyan cites an article relied upon by MacPherson—Hansen, Olkkonen, <br>
Walter, and Gegenfurtner, ‘Memory Modulates Color Appearance’. His interpretation is subject to the same criti-<br>
cisms that I and others have made of MacPherson’s conclusions. Several of Lupyan’s articles use ‘expectation’ and <br>
‘meaningfulness’ in similarly unsophisticated ways.<br>
