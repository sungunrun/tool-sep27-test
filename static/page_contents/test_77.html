efference copy: a non-perceptual invariance 77</div>
<br><br>
Efference copy operates in sensory systems of very simple organisms. It occurs in a <br>
worm (nematode: <i>Caenorhabdilis elegans</i>) with only 302 neurons. The worm has two <br>
avoidance reflexes. One moves it forward when its tail is stimulated. One moves it back-<br>
ward when its head is stimulated. The reflexes are potentially in conflict. If the tail is stimu-<br>
lated and the worm moves forward, its head sensors are usually stimulated by soil or water. <br>
If the reverse reflex were then caused, the worm would be caught in an unending cycle of <br>
forward and backward movement.<br>
<br>
The vicious cycle is avoided because neuronal signals from the move-forward reflex <br>
inhibit the internal effects of stimulation of the head sensors. Sensory registration from <br>
the head sensors is produced, but the signal to the move-backward reflex is blocked.<br>
<br>
A functionally similar mechanism occurs in a sea slug (gastropod <i>Pleurobranchaea</i>). <br>
Normally, the slug engages in avoidance movements if the sensors around its mouth are <br>
stimulated. Similar tactile stimulation does not produce avoidance when it is feeding. <br>
Efference copy during feeding blocks withdrawal commands.<br>
<br>
Some animals’ action reflexes are often stimulated multiple times on given occasions, <br>
such as crayfish, cockroach, and dogfish. The debilitating feedback loop is avoided by <br>
silencing not the action-relevant reflex response to sensory stimulation, but registration of <br>
stimulation itself. The effect of this silencing is to prevent over-stimulation, which would <br>
habituate the sensors.<br>
<br>
Functionally similar blockage of stimulus registration occurs in the auditory system <br>
of crickets, whose own chirping could overstimulate their sound sensors. In locusts, <br>
pigeons, cats, and humans, visual sensory input is suppressed during saccadic eye movement. <br>
Such suppression prevents blur and contributes to avoiding jumpy effects of proximal <br>
stimulations.<br>
<br>
All these instances of efference copy—of signals to a sensory system from actional or <br>
other movement impetuses—constitute what <i>might</i> be regarded as a kind of objectifica-<br>
tion. The effect of proximal stimulation is modified. The biological function of the modifi-<br>
cation is to increase the likely relevance of registration of proximal stimulation to those <br>
objective features of the environment with which the animal must cope. There is a broad <br>
separation of proximal stimulation that would probably help detect survival-relevant fea-<br>
tures of the environment from proximal stimulation that would be unlikely to do so.<br>
<br>
However, none of these mechanisms in themselves counts as producing the objectifica-<br>
tion discussed in Chapter 2. None yield perceptual constancies. In the worm case, sensing <br>
is not affected at all by efference copy. Only its connection to behavior is affected. The for-<br>
mation of the sensory state is explained entirely as a response to proximal stimulation. <br>
Moreover, there is no given environmental feature, representation of which is constant <br>
through significant variations in proximal stimulation. Instead, the same sort of proximal <br>
stimulation may or may not yield behavioral responses, given different antecedent motion <br>
signals in the organism. The “objectification” produced by these sorts of efference copy <br>
is purely functional. It is not the causal-representational sort involved in perceptual <br>
constancies.<br>
<br>
When the sensory systems of crayfish, crickets, pigeons, and humans are selectively <br>
turned off, the effect is for the sensory system to sense the environment better. That is why <br>
the mechanism can tempt one into thinking of it as yielding a kind of objectification. But <br>
since the immediate effect of proximal stimulation is blocked, processing sensory re gis tra-<br>
tions beyond the initial registration is not effected. Initial registrations are not perceptual.</div>
