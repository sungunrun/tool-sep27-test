742 Conclusion</div>
<br><br>
Partly because of the mistake of associating feed-forward processing with perception <br>
and feedback processing with cognition, seeing, at least after the earliest-formed percep-<br>
tions, was construed as a mishmash of perceptual and cognitive factors. Here, neglect of <br>
the second change in the science mattered. It contributed to leaving the notion cognition <br>
ungrounded in any serious understanding of psychological kinds or psychological <br>
explanation.<br>
<br>
Some opponents of modularity have, I think, successfully argued contra Pylyshyn that <br>
causal chains from unquestionably cognitive states—beliefs and propositional-level <br>
 intentions—connect to processing that occurs just outside the feed-forward sweep, but <br>
inside what is commonly accepted as aspects of visual perceptual processing. The chains <br>
connect cognitive states to orbital factors in visual processing—perceptual memory, per-<br>
ceptual anticipation, perceptual attention. So, at least indirectly, cognitive states affect vis-<br>
ual perception. On the other hand, the philosophical interest of these points has been less <br>
than advertised. The points have not deeply affected understanding the role of perception <br>
in epistemology or natural science. They have not illumined any large-scale change in how <br>
perceptual psychology is done or understood. Although relevant to evaluating Pylyshyn’s <br>
conception of modularity, they have had little effect on understanding how perceptual-<br>
level processing is explained in the science.<br>
<br>
The most striking philosophical failure in interpreting the first-cited change in the <br>
 science lies in not seriously reflecting on what cognition is—taken as a genuinely supra-<br>
perceptual level type of representation. This issue remains open.<br>
<br>
Propositional attitudes are paradigms of cognition. There are probably other types. <br>
(See Chapter 19, the section What Should Count as Cognition?.) I believe that <br>
exploring this issue is a central task for philosophy of mind and philosophy of psychology.<br>
<br>
A subsidiary philosophical failure, cited two paragraphs back, lay in not connecting <br>
notions of impenetrability closely enough with scientific explanation. Although Fodor and <br>
Pylyshyn were deeply interested in computational explanation, their conception of pene-<br>
tration did not feature it. They were too confident that they could explain computational <br>
explanation by causal insensitivity to information outside a module. Opponents largely <br>
ignored computation. (See Chapter 19, up through the section A Computational <br>
Construal of Modularity.)<br>
<br>
For understanding perception, the main upshot has been failure to recognize the uni-<br>
ties, both in representational kind and in causal processing, of the visual and visuo-motor <br>
systems. These systems are inevitably impinged upon by cognitive sources. But computa-<br>
tional, causal explanation of the workings of these systems brackets cognitive causal ante-<br>
cedents. Satisfying, systematic, law-invoking—though of course incomplete—explanations <br>
begin with proximal stimulation and antecedent sensory sets and perceptual-level states <br>
and capacities, and end with visual perceptions, perceptually guided motor commands, <br>
and other perceptual-level states.<br>
<br>
A third change in the science needs emphasis. I have alluded to it often. I have not  featured <br>
it. This change has been toward experimentation that focuses on perception’s having been <br>
molded by the environment. The shift aligns the experimental procedures of the science with <br>
its long-term acknowledgment of the anti-individualist setting in which representational <br>
content was determined–through sensory interactions with the distal environment.<br>
<br>
The shift has been encouraged by repeated discoveries that phenomena first thought to <br>
be primarily relevant to registration of the retinal image have counterparts that are cues to </div>
