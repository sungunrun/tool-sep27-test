(1) A capacity for perception must be associated with a capacity for guiding represen-<br>
tational use of perception. [Relevant use involves perceptually guided responses, passive <br>
or active—passive responses such as <i>schreck</i> or affective reactions or active responses such <br>
as navigating, fleeing, predating, and so on. The use must itself have representational, <br>
including perceptual content: <i>schreck</i> with the content that close-by dangerous body; flee-<br>
ing with the content that approaching dangerous body.]<br>
<br>
(2) Use cannot always be simultaneous with perception, but must sometimes follow it <br>
in time: use cannot both be guided by perception and always co-occur with it in stant an-<br>
eous ly. [The transition from perception to use plays itself out over at least short time <br>
intervals.]<br>
<br>
(3) For perception to guide use, past perception must be coordinated through memory <br>
with present or anticipated representational use.<br>
<br>
(4) The coordination requires sensitivity to temporal order; it requires a functioning <br>
representational capacity that connects present use determination with a previous percep-<br>
tual state. The coordinate requires some sensitivity, at least to temporal order, in the <br>
perception-response systems of the animal.<br>
<br>
(5) The systematic coordination of temporal sensitivity, including sensitivity to tem-<br>
poral order, with perceptual representation suffices for representation of time or temporal <br>
relations. What it is for a temporal sensitivity to be representational is for it to be appropri-<br>
ated systematically in perceptually guided enterprises, more generally, representational <br>
enterprises.<br>
<br>
(6) So, a capacity for perception must be associated with a capacity for temporal repre-<br>
sentation. There must be some past-present representation of temporal order, in the rela-<br>
tion between perception and perceptual memory (possibly also in the perceptual system <br>
itself) and the relation between perception, perceptual memory, and representation <br>
in use.277<br><br>
Steven Gross advances two main objections to this argument.278<br>
<br>
The first targets step (2). He claims that a simple organism’s use of its perception might <br>
consist in the organism’s entering the perceptual state itself, given that the perception is <br>
functional for the organism. The perception itself could initiate movement away from a <br>
predator or toward a food source. Such an organism would have no use for memory.<br>
<br>
I do not find this objection forceful.279 I think that guidance of representational use in <br>
step (1) does require temporal succession. I take (2) to be necessitated by (1). I support <br>
(1) below. Gross’s example runs together a perceptual state’s causing a movement with a <br><br>

278 S. Gross, ‘Perception and the Origins of Temporal Representation’, <i>Pacific Philosophical Quarterly</i> 98 <br>
(2017), 275–292. Although I think Gross’s criticism mistaken, I regard it as careful and serious. It is unusual in <br>
deriving from close reading that never takes passages out of context. It puts different passages together in a <br>
reflective way. Some of its points made me aware of need for refinement and for making my point of view more <br>
explicit. It is the sort of criticism one hopes for. On first hearing the criticism at a conference on <i>Origins of <br>
Objectivity</i> with some scientists and philosophers in St. Petersburg in 2013, I thought that the second of the main <br>
objections was probably right. On reflection, I came back to my original point of view, enlightened by the <br>
process.<br>
<br>
279 Gross over-reads (2). He thinks that by writing that use cannot always be simultaneous with perception, <br>
I am committed to the idea that use can sometimes be simultaneous with perception. Although I am at fault in <br>
creating the suggestion, I was in fact simply making the minimum claim needed to make the argument go <br>
through. All I needed was “sometimes”. I believe “always”.</div><div id="PGHEADER">
