Primitive Attribution of Mechanical Causation 457</div>

evidence that infants perceive causality in Michotte’s launching events, they recruit these <br>
<br>
representations even when not part of a data-driven perceptual process.591<br><br>
In sum, the argument goes as follows. To represent mechanical causation behind the <br>
screen, the children must make an inference from perception. Such inferences show up as <br>
early as any representation of mechanical causation shows up. So, such representation is <br>
inferential from the beginning. Michotte’s hypothesis that primitive representation of <br>
mechanical causation is perceptual requires that primitive representation of mechanical <br>
causation occur without inference. It is committed to a non-inferential stage of representa-<br>
tion that occurs before inferences to unperceived cases get started. So there is evidence <br>
against Michotte’s hypothesis that primitive representation of mechanical causation is <br>
perceptual.<br>
<br>
This argument lacks force. It depends on a common misconception of perceptual sys-<br>
tems and an overly broad use of the term ‘inference’. Perceptual systems always come with <br>
perceptual memory and perceptual anticipation systems. These systems are not “higher-<br>
level”. They do not constitute cognitive, post-perceptual capacities. They are inevitable <br>
auxiliaries of perception—not more advanced in either their representational contents or <br>
their operations. They are phylogenetically coincident with perception. I develop this <br>
point in Chapters 16–18.<br>
<br>
The other difficulty with the argument is that, given that inductive propositional infer-<br>
ences can occur on the basis of one or two cases, there may be no developmental <i>stage</i> <br>
discoverable by psychologists, even if the “inferences” were inductive-propositional. <br>
Children could make the “inferences” based on background abilities to track bodies <br>
behind occlusions, which involve anticipations of mechanical motion. With enough devel-<br>
opmental maturity, they could do so on the <i>first case</i> of occluded mechanical causation <br>
that fit parameters of motion behind occlusions. The first case might even be a Ball-type <br>
experiment, described above. There need be no <i>stage</i> during which the children work up <br>
to a supra-perceptual inference to unseen cases of causation.<br>
<br>
The argument’s first difficulty is more important. It goes to the nature of perceptual <br>
 systems. The central fact about perception—that it is associated with perceptual constancies— <br>
commonly depends on connections among perception, memory, and anticipation. Having <br>
a competence to represent an attribute, say a shape, as that attribute, despite different <br>
proximal stimulations stemming from different perspectives on the shape consists in hav-<br>
ing a capacity to connect one perception as of that shape to a different perception as of the <br>
shape. This link among perceptual capacities is in place when the perceptual system is <br>
stimulated. Use of the competence yields memories and anticipations of perceived entities. <br>
For example, perceiving a cube head-on is associated with anticipation of perceiving more <br>
sides if one moves, or if the cube rotates.<br>
<br>
Such anticipations include anticipations of representations of currently unperceived <br>
aspects of the shape. So an aspect of perceiving a 3-D cube shape is having dispositional <br>
anticipations of what unperceived areas of the cube—say, flanking sides—would come <br>
into view if the perceiver or the cube were to move in certain ways. Perceiving is sys tem at-<br>
ic al ly connected with anticipating unperceived attribute-instances. The subject matters <br>
and modes of presentation of such anticipations are the same as those of perceptions. They <br><br>
