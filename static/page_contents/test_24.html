These claims are confused. Or they rest on a reductionism that has no claim to rational <br>
allegiance. No reduction of psychology to information registration has ever been success-<br>
fully argued. In fact, no such reductionism has come to grips with the central issue— <br>
perception. None of these claims is backed by serious reflection on perceptual psych ology. <br>
None has even tried to reduce the science of perceptual psychology to a  science of infor-<br>
mation registration. I think that pan-information-registration theories of representation <br>
are philosophies, or ideologies, gone astray.<br>
<br>
There is indeed an intuitive analogy between failure of biological function and in ac cur-<br>
acy of representation. Take heat sensors in earthworms. Assume that these sensors register <br>
information about heat. It would be possible to stimulate the sensors artificially, to cause <br>
the earthworm to move in ways that would be functional in a hot environment, but non-<br>
functional in its actual environment. It might be tempting to conclude that the sensors <br>
produced inaccurate representational states and that the earthworm had misperceived the <br>
environment. Then information registration and representation—sensing and perceiv-<br>
ing—would be conflated.<br>
<br>
A short terminological interlude is needed here. In my terminology, <i>veridicality</i> is the <br>
genus of which truth and accuracy are species. <i>Truth</i> is propositional veridicality. <i>Accuracy</i> is <br>
non-propositional veridicality. Since perceptual representation is non-propositional, <br>
I mostly discuss accuracy, not truth, in this book.<br>
<br>
The first thing to note in avoiding conflating information registration and representation <br>
is that success and failure in realizing a biological function are not the same as success and <br>
failure of veridicality. Success in realizing a biological function is a practical matter—fitness <br>
for survival long enough to reproduce. Accuracy and inaccuracy are not practical matters.21<br>
<br>
In principle, biological functional success could be correlated with inaccuracy all the <br>
way down. Biological failure could be correlated with accuracy, all the way down. Error <br>
can contribute to fitness. A deer’s misperceptions of danger combined with fast reactions <br>
might not only insure against being eaten. Fleeing because of misperceptions could make <br>
it better at fleeing. Conversely, accurate representation can contribute to fitness failure. <br>
Getting things right might take too long or require too much apparatus, whereas being <br>
attuned to the risks of danger suffices to keep life going. The practical value of contribu-<br>
tion to fitness is simply not the same as the representational value of being accurate. Trying <br>
to explain veridicality conditions in terms of conditions for any kind of practical success, <br>
including biological success, is changing the subject.<br>
<br>
Contribution to biological fitness and accuracy—at least approximate accuracy—<i>do</i> track <br>
one another, for the most part, especially at the most primitive levels of representation. The <br>
close connection between accuracy and fitness does not affect my primary point. The differ-<br>
ence between the practical notion of biological function and the notion of ac cur acy is so <br>
basic that an explanation that centers on biological functionality inevitably explains some-<br>
thing different from an explanation that centers on representation that involves veridical-<br>
ity conditions. I think it vanishingly unlikely that notions of accuracy will be reduced to <br>
notions of biological function. Again, a purported reduction would change the subject.<br>
<br>
Registering information entails having a function. In most cases discussed here, the <br>
function is a biological function. I assumed, for the sake of argument (though I also <br>
believe it to be true), that an earthworm’s sensing heat is fully accounted for functionally <br><br>
