<b>Perceptual Reference is Partly Guided by Perceptual Attribution<br><br>
</div>
</b>Perceptual reference—perception of particulars—does not transpire purely via perceptual <br>
attributives, of course. Occurrent, cause-dependent referential applications are events <br>
ne ces sary to picking out particulars perceptually. Occurrent perceptual states are exercises <br>
of competencies to single out particulars. Individuals can and sometimes do see one thing <br>
and a moment later see another, even if they are not discernible through their properties, <br>
and even though one has no basis for knowing that one has perceived two things. The <br>
perceptual attributives that one applies to the two things are the same. Yet, the perceptual <br>
references are different.<br>
<br>
Perceptual reference often occurs despite the fact that many of the applied perceptual <br>
attributives fail to be accurate of the particular. In fact, all the attributives most salient to <br>
casual reflection can fail. One can perceive a cloud of smoke as a body, not only getting the <br>
relevant kind, <i>body</i>, wrong, but also getting the specific shape, location, color, and <br>
motion wrong.<br>
<br>
Such points have led some to conclude that one can perceive something and attribute <br>
no attribute to it, and that one can perceive something but get nothing right about it—<br>
apply no attributive that is accurate of it. I think both views very much mistaken.<br>
<br>
What makes the perception be of the cloud is the cloud’s causing a perceptual state’s <br>
discrimination of the cloud from other causal factors by its generic shape—its rough <br>
outer-boundary connectedness. The attributive outer-boundary-connected is attributed to <br>
and accurate of the perceived cloud. So is the attributive object. To be perceived, the cloud <br>
must be discriminated by the perceptual state in some way. Generic topological proper-<br>
ties, like <i>outer-boundary connectedness</i>, commonly do the job for spatially unified objects <br>
that occupy 3-D space. A perceptual attributive that veridically attributes some such <br>
generic topological property sets off the relevant cause (the cloud) as the entity that is <br>
perceived. This point applies to the perception of most entities that are called ‘objects’ in <br>
the psychological literature—perception of dots, surfaces, bodies, clouds, piles of sand, <br>
puddles of water, rainbows, and so on. The point is illustrative. I think that not all per-<br>
ceived entities have outer-boundary connectedness.<br>
<br>
Despite the fact that perception of (perceptual reference to) a particular can succeed <br>
even though many perceptual attributives are misapplied, perception of particulars relies <br>
essentially on perceptual attributives. There are general reasons for these two principles. <br>
I think that some of these reasons are apriori.<br><br>
(AA1)  In every perceptual state, each occurrent, demonstrative-like, perceptual referential <br>
<br>
application must be associated with at least one applied perceptual at tribu tive that <br>
<br>
functions to represent the (purportedly) picked out particular as being of <br>
<br>
some type.<br>
(AA2)  In every perceptual state, each occurrent, demonstrative-like, perceptual referential <br>
<br>
application that succeeds in referring to a particular must be associated with appli-<br>
<br>
cation of at least one perceptual attributive that functions to dis crim in ate that par-<br>
<br>
ticular from some other particulars in the environment, and that is <i>accurate of</i> that <br>
<br>
particular. That is, every perception of a particular must involve an application of at <br>
<br>
least one discriminatory perceptual attributive that is ac cur ate of that particular.</div>
