What Should Count as Cognition? 729</div>
<br><br>
The scope of perceptual learning is itself not clearly circumscribed. It seems likely—but <br>
not known—that some analogical operations occur in perceptual or perceptual-level sys-<br>
tems. It is not known partly because it is not known how large the scope of perceptual <br>
learning is. ‘Seems likely’ does not spell ‘fact’. Many analogical operations are cognitive. It <br>
is an open question whether all are. Whether analogizing is a mark of cognition remains <br>
worth exploring.1188<br>
<br>
An important type of analogy is <i>spatial scaling</i>. Children up to age 3 have difficulty <br>
transferring a successful search between layouts with different scales, even if the layouts <br>
are similar in all other respects. Developing this capacity may depend on developing a <br>
proficiency in using symbols.1189 Reading maps requires a dramatic type of scaling. Such <br>
symbol use, which involves scaling as well as matching an iconic structure to a subject <br>
matter, is plausibly cognitive. Understanding relations between scaling and navigational <br>
abilities that are perceptual-level, would be a source of insight into the border between <br>
perception and cognition.<br>
<br>
Spatial scaling is worth comparing with rotation, or whatever processes yield percep-<br>
tual recognition in ways that are time-proportionate to the degree of orientation of a rep-<br>
resented shape. In the rotation case, it is possible that the same operation that occurs fast <br>
and unconsciously in <i>pre</i>-perceptual operations that help form perceptual shape con-<br>
stancy, reappears in perceptual constancies in linkages among different perceptual attribu-<br>
tives for 3-D volume shape, and then comes under conscious control in imagining shapes <br>
in different orientations. (See Chapter 18, the section Perceptual Imagining.)<br>
<br>
Spatial scaling may seem superficially similar. The visual system carries out pre-<br>
perceptual scaling on the retinal image as a step in arriving at visual perceptual size con-<br>
stancy. (See Chapter 3, the section Visual Spatial Perceptual Constancies <br>
and Body Categorization.) Linkages produced partly by these pre-perceptual <br>
operations re-occur, dispositionally, among perceptual states linked in a size constancy—<br>
representing the same size as such at different distances. Such linkages constitute a dis pos-<br>
ition to spatial scaling. In size constancy, different perceptual representations are linked as <br>
indicating the same size, even though they derive from impressions of different retinal <br>
sizes. So scaling of registration of retinal size relates <i>different</i> perceptions as of the <i>same</i> <br>
size, deriving from different distances.<br>
<br>
Size constancy is an early-developing perceptual constancy. Up to 2½ years, children <br>
seem unable to take a further step: treating different <i>environmental</i>  sizes, among struc-<br>
tured complexes, as bearing relations of equivalence—equivalence in spatial structure. <br>
Children find it hard to recognize structural analogies among different actual sizes in such <br>
complexes. The pre-perceptual operation on the retinal image depends on grouping as <br>
equivalent different retinal-image-sizes. The difficulty seems to be objectifying this <br><br>
