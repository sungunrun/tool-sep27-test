Perception as Objectification 53</div>

through the adventitious, proximal aspects of stimulus encounters. The contrastive pro-<br>
cess yields perceptual states that represent specific environmental particulars, properties, <br>
relations, and kinds.<br>
<br>
Many <i>non­ perceptual</i> sensory systems involve complex information processing and <br>
evolutionarily refined fitting of sensory states to the environment in such a way as to bene-<br>
fit the organism. What makes a system perceptual is not just greater complexity in pro-<br>
cessing or greater environmental fit. All sensory systems evolved to fit the environment <br>
well enough to help organisms survive. Some non-perceptual sensory systems involve <br>
processing that is more complex than processing in some perceptual systems. All sensory <br>
systems generate states that are environmentally adaptive. Their processing might be <br>
thought to involve a kind of “objectification” through filtering initial proximal re gis tra-<br>
tions to produce states that are likely to fit the environment better than the initial re gis tra-<br>
tions of proximal stimulation.<br>
<br>
What makes a system perceptual is the specific kind of processing involved. It is pro-<br>
cessing that distinguishes registration of proximal stimulation from states that are best <br>
individuated representationally, and partly by reference to a reality that is independent of <br>
proximal stimulation—independently of happen-so aspects of the individual and relevant <br>
to something that could be common to many different stimulus occasions. Objectification <br>
is a process that separates the idiosyncratic-occasion-dependence of registration of prox-<br>
imal stimulation from cues in the proximal stimulus that enable representation of an <br>
in dependent reality. Understanding objectification and hence representation (and percep-<br>
tual veridicality conditions) depends on reflecting on cases, which make the abstract <br>
exposition more concrete. Chapter 3 centers on cases.<br>
<br>
I think that the relevant objectification is concretized in what perceptual psychology <br>
counts as <i>perceptual constancies</i>. Perceptual constancies instantiate the specific type of <br>
objectification that I have been elaborating. They are empirically testable guides to apply-<br>
ing the more abstract and potentially more amorphous notion of objectification. But the <br>
notion of objectification guides the understanding of the cases. I think that the ob ject ifi ca-<br>
tion involved in perceptual constancies marks the distinction between perception and <br>
non-perceptual sensory information registration.<br>
<br>
<i>Perceptual constancies</i> are certain capacities systematically to perceptually represent an <br>
attribute or particular <i>as</i> that attribute or particular under a significant variety of re gis tra-<br>
tions of proximal stimulation.<br>
<br>
A corollary of this initial step toward explication is that perceptual constancies are <br>
 certain capacities to represent an attribute or particular as that attribute or particular <br>
from different perceptual perspectives, produced by significantly different proximal <br>
stimulations.<br>
<br>
The formula, stated in preceding paragraph but one can seem circular. It is just an initial <br>
step in an explication. The term ‘perceptual’ in the position of <i>explicans</i> in this initial <br>
 formula is given independent substance in the explication by a range of cases agreed upon <br>
in perceptual psychology, which occupy Chapter 3, where the cases are instances of <br>
objectification.<br>
<br>
At this stage, the formula tells us that perceptual constancies occur at the level of per-<br>
ception, not conception; that they are representational capacities; and that they are capaci-<br>
ties to center on a constant in the subject matter despite significant differences in proximal <br>
stimulation.</div>
