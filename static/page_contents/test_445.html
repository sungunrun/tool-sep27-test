Methodology for Finding Perceptual Attributives 445</div>

contributing to capacities for propositional inference. Conceptual capacities can be as <br>
fine-grained as perceptual abilities. One can co-opt an iconic perceptual representation <br>
and represent through it in propositional reasoning.<br>
<br>
The idea that only perception has retinotopic aspects is a product of the empiricist mis-<br>
take of thinking that percepts must be more concrete, less abstract, than concepts. This <br>
mistake is related to that of thinking that perceptual attributives cannot represent generic <br>
attributes. (See Chapter 4, the section Taxonomic Hierarchies in Perception.) <br>
It is also related to the mistaken view that concepts cannot have the iconic richness or <br>
perspectival specificity of perceptual attributives. (See Chapter 9, the section Iconic <br>
Perception, Iconic Concepts, Iconic Representation in Propositional <br>
Thought.) All three mistakes derive from the old empiricist view that concepts and per-<br>
cepts differ basically in degree of abstraction—with concepts more abstract and percep-<br>
tions more concrete. Concepts are distinguished by their role in propositional capacities, <br>
not by their degree of abstraction. (See Chapter 19, the section The Empiricist Model <br>
of Perception and Cognition: Degrees of Abstraction.)<br>
<br>
One can have a concept of an object, localized in environmental space, associated with a <br>
canonical view of the object, from exactly the angle from which one normally sees it. <br>
Moreover, a concept that itself involves no retinotopic aspects might rely for its application <br>
base on perceptual attributives whose modes of presentation essentially involve retino-<br>
topic aspects. Suppose that the concept does not attribute the same attribute that its appli-<br>
cation base does. Thus the concept is like bodyc, causec, agentc, facec, anger-expressionc, and <br>
expressionc ofc angerc. Applying all these concepts via visual perception requires an appli-<br>
cation base of perceptual attributives for shape or motion. Even the perceptual attributives <br>
bodyp, facep, and anger-expressionp (and perceptual attributives for <i>cause</i> and <i>agent</i>, if <br>
there are such attributives) require an application base in perceptual attributives for shape <br>
and motion. One cannot see a body, face, or anger-expression neat. Then the concept could <br>
in principle be at the lowest representational level at which the attribute is attributed, as <br>
the concept anger is. But its applications could be affected retinotopically. In fact, bodyc <br>
and facec have perceptual counterparts—perceptual attributives that represent the same <br>
attributes. I think that causec, agentc, facec, anger-expressionc also probably have perceptual <br>
counterparts. But the attributive expression of anger almost surely indicates attributes that <br>
no perceptual attributive does (<i>expression</i>, <i>of</i>, and <i>anger</i>). Finding that an attributive’s <br>
applications have retinotopic aspects does not show that it is perceptual. It does not even <br>
show that the lowest representational level at which the relevant attribute is represented is <br>
the level of perception.<br>
<br>
So finding that a representation’s application through perception is retinotopic is not a <br>
stand-alone method to show that the representation is perceptual. Again, a strong basis for <br>
taking an attributive to be perceptual is finding that its formation laws are illuminating <br>
<i>computational</i> extensions from formation laws that govern attributives that have already <br>
been determined to be perceptual. Evidence for statements of such laws is inevitably com-<br>
plex and varied. It is easier to show that a candidate for a new category of attributive is not <br>
perceptual than it is to show that it is perceptual. However, it is possible, even in our pre-<br>
sent state of relative ignorance about computational models of later stages of perception-<br>
formation, to make informed conjectures.<br>
<br>
I have expressed scepticism about silver-bullet claims of simple signs of being perceptual— <br>
adaptation, pop-out, bi-stability, retinotopy. I have also rejected many popular claims </div>
