176  Form and Semantics of Perceptual Contents</div>
<br><br>
It is very possible that attribution of causal relations between perceived entities occurs <br>
in perception.<br>
<br>
Nearly all attribution of functional attributes is at least implicitly relational. Perceiving <br>
something as dangerous or as food is relative to the individual’s needs or functions. <i>These</i> <br>
needs or functions need not be represented as such. However, I conjecture that some rela-<br>
tion to the individual or individual’s position, indexed as ego-relevant, is represented in <br>
such representations’ accuracy conditions. If mate is a perceptual attributive, it is probably <br>
a relational attributive anchored in some ego-indexed application. Attributions type com-<br>
petencies. Such a competence may relate danger, food, or mate to an egocentric anchor.<br>
<br>
In any case, individuals and their perceptual systems certainly perceptually attribute <br>
relations. One must distinguish perceptual <i>attribution</i> of relations from <i>perception</i> of rela-<br>
tions and from <i>perception</i> of relation-<i>instances</i>. Relation-types are not perceived. Relation-<br>
types are not localized in space and time and lack relevant causal power for affecting the <br>
senses. They are not candidates for being perceived entities. I provisionally accept the <br>
existence of relation-instances. Those relevant to perception are localized in space and time. <br>
Do we perceive and attribute-<i>instances</i> of relation-types that we perceptually attribute?<br>
<br>
Suppose that there are relation-instances. It would be wrong to hold that we see the <br>
distance instance to a perceived body. We perceptually <i>represent</i> the distance relation by <br>
indicating it and attributing it. The instance of the specific distance relation, like the type, <br>
lacks the causal power that the body has. It does not reflect light into sensory receptors. <br>
Perceived entities are causes of the states that refer to them. Perceptual reference is to per-<br>
ceived particulars.<br>
<br>
Perhaps as a consequence of these considerations, some philosophers and some scien-<br>
tists (nearly always scientists are not specialized in perception) have a tendency to hold that <br>
representation of relations is “more abstract” than perception can be. Some have even con-<br>
cluded that representation of relations is a post-perceptual process. Some hold that repre-<br>
sentation of relations is a mark of the propositional. This conclusion is certainly mistaken. <br>
Spatial and temporal attribution are basic to normal perceptual representation. (See empirical <br>
work cited in Chapter 8.) Such attribution is inescapably relational. As noted, there is <br>
empirical ground for recognizing other types of perceptual attribution of relations as well.<br>
<br>
The mistaken conclusion may derive partly from failure to recognize the role of attribution— <br>
of characterization—in perception. Perception constitutively involves attribution, as well <br>
as singling out of perceived entities. Perceptual attribution—characterization—clearly <br>
includes relational characterization, as well as property and kind characterization. All <br>
attribution consists partly in some type of abstraction, a type of patterned representational <br>
relation (indication) to repeatable attributes—that goes beyond one-off causal connec-<br>
tions to particulars. One perceives particulars partly by perceiving them as instances of <br>
repeatable patterns.<br>
<br>
So clear thinking about perception—distinguishing attribution and indication of types <br>
from reference to the particulars that are perceived—can dispense with one source of the <br>
mistaken idea that representation of relations is too abstract for perception.<br>
<br>
Again, relational <i>types</i> are abstract entities and lack causal powers. One can sensorily <br>
perceive only particulars, or type-instances, that are spatio-temporally local and that have <br>
relevant causal powers. One cannot perceive relation-<i>types</i>, strictly speaking, though one <br>
can perceptually indicate and attribute them. The same point applies to property-and <br>
kind-types. They lack spatial-temporal location and lack relevant causal power.</div>
