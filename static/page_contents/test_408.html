For natural scenes, Treisman’s binding theory got the role of attention backwards. <br>
Perception of objects draws attention, but does not depend on it. Attention yields material <br>
for consciously accessible memory. It is not necessary for perception of many specific <br>
objects, including bodies and their properties. Much unconscious memory derives from <br>
unattended aspects of perception. Similarly, localization of entities to specific spatial <br>
regions depends on geometrical principles that govern the directions in which the eyes are <br>
pointed and the distance between the eyes—stereoscopic principles—and on other cues. <br>
such as focus of the retinal image, not on attention.<br>
<br>
To summarize main positive upshots of this chapter: First-formed perception is richer <br>
than the views discussed at the beginning of this chapter allow. Still, in the first 60–120 ms <br>
after stimulus onset, perception is sketch-like. Filling in the high frequency information <br>
that provides detail in our conscious perceptual states just begins during that interval. <br>
First-formed perception does, however, represent 3-D volume shapes and categorizes bod-<br>
ies by shape and size, without essential input from attention, memory, or concepts.<br>
<br>
All perceptual states function to be <i>de re</i>. They represent what they represent in a <br>
context-dependent, occurrence-based, non-inferential manner. If they fail to represent, <br>
they still harbor context-dependent, occurrence-based applications. Although they are not <br>
products of inference, their formation depends, of course, on a series of trans form ations in <br>
the perceptual system. They are trivially non-inferential in the sense that they are not <br>
propositional, and do not derive from a computational transformation whose input <br>
includes propositional states.<br>
<br>
First-formed perceptions are fragile. They are commonly lost to the psychological sys-<br>
tem unless they have help. Help can come from salience or task importance. Help can <br>
come from longer exposure. Help can come from repeated exposure, from attention, or <br>
from memory.<br>
<br>
First-formed perceptions are formed ultra-rapidly. Given the initial state of the system, <br>
formation is automatic—the better for coping with a complex, dangerous world. For all its <br>
fragility, first-formed perception is the first representational bulwark against danger and <br>
the first representational route to safety. The speed of its formation and its representation <br>
of bodies and faces by their shapes, and in spatial arrangements, are signs of its practical <br>
function to guide escape from harm and finding succor.<br><br>

<b>FOOTNOTES</b><br>
<b>Cont FN</b>490 A good account of the first 100–150 ms of visual perception is provided by A. Raftopoulos, <i>Cognition and <br>
Perception: How Do Psychology and Neural Science Inform Philosophy?</i> (Cambridge, Mass: The MIT Press, 2009), <br>
chapter 2; A. Raftopoulos, ‘Pre-Cueing, the Epistemic Role of Early Vision, and the Cognitive Impenetrability of <br>
Early Vision’, <i>Frontiers in Psychology</i> 8 (2017), 1–12. My principal criticism of the book, relevant to the present <br>
chapter, is that it assumes that attribution of <i>object</i> and <i>body</i> does not occur in what Raftopoulos calls ‘early <br>
vision’. He takes a 2½-D sketch to constitute the boundary for early vision. As indicated in earlier in this chapter, <br>
a 2½-D sketch is no longer taken to mark a natural processing stage in mainstream science. In the later article, <br>
Raftopoulos does acknowledge that some categorization occurs in the first 100 ms. He does not specify what the <br>
categorizations are. Whereas in 2009 Raftopoulos uses Pylyshyn’s notion of proto-object to apply to the most <br>
advanced entity represented in early vision, this view was based on misconceived theory. For criticism of <br>
Pylyshyn’s notion of proto-object, see Burge, <i>Origins of Objectivity</i>, 453n, 455–456n. In recent work, Raftopoulos <br>
appears to accept Treisman’s views on binding. See Raftopoulos, <i>Cognition and Perception</i>: <i>How Do Psychology <br>
and Neural Science Inform Philosophy?</i>, 54, 65–66, 89ff., 109, 113, 116, 118. Criticism of Treisman’s views occupies <br>
this chapter, the section Two Lines of Empirical Criticism of Treisman’s Theory. Still, there is <br>
much that is congenial in Raftopoulos’s work. It stands out from much philosophical work for its engagement <br>
with science. Here, I bracket Raftopoulos’s discussion of cognitive penetration. Differences on this issue are con-<br>
nected to differences about the 2½-D sketch, about binding, and about proto-objects. I return to cognitive pene-<br>
tration in Chapters 13–19, especially 13 and 19.</div>
