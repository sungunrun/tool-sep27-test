remembered only as a generic amalgam of specific features that it had on various occasions. <br>
Or they could be remembered via learning from a variety of past perceptions of it, or even <br>
from re-imagining the past perceived body after the fact. (If the <i>de re</i> memory is not per-<br>
ceptual, the attributives could come from talking to someone else who was able to make <i>de <br>
re</i> reference to the body.) In a non-episodic perceptual <i>de re</i> memory, no occasion is <br>
remembered as it was specifically perceived. A referential application to a particular may be <br>
guided by an attributive that is constructed, filled in, or imagined from past perception. The <br>
memory might use a mix of perceptual experiences of the particular over many occasions. <br>
Then the memory would not function to represent the particular as it was perceived in any <br>
particular episode. It would have fallibly tracked the particular as it was “on average” on past <br>
occasions when it was perceived. Such a memory would not be episodic.971<br>
<br>
Thus, one might remember a particular lion that one has seen. Details of the lion’s look <br>
have been amalgamated from several sightings. No specific sightings of the lion’s signature <br>
features is retained. So no specific betokening of a secondary attribution is retained.<br>
<br>
There remains room for episodic memories—perceptual and conceptual—to retain the <br>
perceptual perspective of a past episode. It is important to remember that perceptual <br>
attributives, hence conceptualizations of them, come at various levels of abstraction—not <br>
just the most concrete levels. (See Chapter 4, the section Taxonomic Hierarchies in <br>
Perception.) A perspective from a past episode can be preserved at any of various <br>
 levels of abstraction, below the most abstract levels. Here preservation of the <i>de re</i> referen-<br>
tial applications to relatively specific <i>features</i> of objects is crucial to preserving the original <br>
perspective in making the memory episodic.<br><br>

</b>Usually, more properties of objects are remembered than if properties are not bound to a <br>
bearer.972 This <i>object effect</i> encouraged slot models of working memory. It almost surely <br>
figures in all types of memory, except perhaps the most primitive short-term types. Of <br>
course, it competes with other factors in affecting storage and retrieval. (See Chapter 16, <br>
the section Working Memory.)<br>
<br>
The phenomenon can be taken to be an instance of chunking.973 Properties naturally <br>
come in packages. Shape, size, color occur together in bodies and surfaces. Iconic visual <br>
representation tends to package such properties. Memories tend to retain biases, even in <br>
storing non-iconic representation (for example, verbal representation). The biases derive <br>
from registering co-occurrence tendencies (statistical or grammatical). Such tendencies <br><br>
