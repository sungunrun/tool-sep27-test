Perceptual Categorization is Perceptual 489</div>
<br><br>
perception and cognition, or perception and conception. I know of no argument, much <br>
less a convincing one, that perception is limited to cases that authors who write this way <br>
count as non-meaningful.<br>
<br>
Any perceptual attribution—including shape attributions and color attributions—is <br>
meaningful in an ordinary sense. Animals can use any perceptual attribution to initiate <br>
representationally guided action and to be a part of “making sense” of the world in this <br>
sense. I see no justification for counting shape and color attributions non-meaningful and <br>
categorizational attributions meaningful.<br>
<br>
In any case, the science acknowledges perceptual categorization as a perceptual <br>
competence.<br>
<br>
Some of the confusion in philosophy that leads to counting all categorization concep-<br>
tual derives from confused conceptions of what concepts are, where concepts are taken to <br>
be non-perceptual representations. I discuss one example. In arguing the idiosyncratic <br>
view that processes in the visual perceptual system generate non-perceptual representa-<br>
tions—concepts—Eric Mandelbaum provides the following explication of concepts. He <br>
cites three marks. First, a concept is supposed to be <i>repeatable</i>, ‘carrying its identity condi-<br>
tions over time’ and presumably being freely instantiatable or ability-general. Second, con-<br>
cepts must embed in compositional contexts. Third, concepts are ‘available for use by <br>
multiple mental systems’. He illustrates such systems by citing ‘reasoning, long-term plan-<br>
ning, memory, articulatory, and motor processes’. He takes concepts to be the building <br>
blocks of ‘thought’, the ‘building blocks through which we achieve rational thinking’. He <br>
places most weight on repeatability.650<br>
<br>
This explication is not helpful. In the first place, all <i>perceptual</i>  attributives—including <br>
attributives that are not categorizers, and that would not count for Mandelbaum as con-<br>
cepts—are repeatable. They are competencies that can be freely exercised on multiple <br>
occasions. They carry their identification conditions over time. Perceptual attributives are <br>
competencies, and competencies can be re-exercised. Individuating the competence does <br>
not depend on associating it with any particular occurrence. All spatial and temporal <br>
attributives, all color and lightness attributives, are repeatable. All can be repeatedly exer-<br>
cised if stimuli and appropriate background conditions are repeated. All ‘carry their iden-<br>
tity conditions’ over time. I believe, further (although this is not an essential point about <br>
their being freely repeatable or ability-general), that all can be retained in memory, and <br>
can figure in tracking and visual search.<br><br>

<b>FOOTNOTES</b><br>
<b>FN</b>650 Mandelbaum, ‘Seeing and Conceptualizing: Modularity and the Shallow Contents of Perception’, 268–269. <br>
The article makes other mistakes. For example, it assumes that there cannot be concepts specific to a sensory <br>
modality. There are certain visual concepts—ability-general representational capacities that constitutively con-<br>
tribute to propositional thought, that are exercised through using visual modes of presentation. Such concepts <br>
differ from counterpart concepts that use tactile modes of presentation, or amodal conceptual abilities: they are <br>
different capacities.<br>
<br>
There are also serious mistakes in reporting my views. In section 2, citing no evidence, Mandelbaum claims <br>
that I hold that perceptual processing does not ‘enter into’ categorization. In fact, in the book he cites (Burge, <br>
<i>Origin of Objectivity</i>) I repeatedly discuss categorization—including attribution of <i>kinds</i>, as a function of percep-<br>
tion (276, 304, 381, 453–455, 539)—and visual perceptual body categorization at some length (437–471). In sec-<br>
tion 6 of the article, without citing a passage, Mandelbaum makes the mistake of thinking that I hold that <br>
iconicity suffices to distinguish the perceptual from the conceptual. I make no such claim. (See note 353 above.) <br>
Functioning to contribute to propositional (potentially rational) thought is, for me, the distinguishing feature of <br>
the conceptual. Although Mandelbaum rejects this basis for distinguishing the conceptual from the perceptual <br>
(see section 6), he does not explain wherein ‘building blocks [of thought] through which we achieve rational <br>
thinking’ are not building blocks of propositional structures.</div>
