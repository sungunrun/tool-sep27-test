572 Perceptual Memory: Short-Term Systems</div>
<br><br>
Memory retention that yields priming effects is supported by neural patterns in the <br>
brain areas that support the primed perceptual state. The memories are stored in areas <br>
specialized for perceptual processing. So neural bases of priming memories are distrib-<br>
uted in different neural areas underlying different stages of perceptual processing. <br>
Memories that effect priming are supported in the same neural loci associated with the <br>
processing of perceptual representations that show the memory-effects on priming. As <br>
processing proceeds, memories are stored at higher levels of visual processing, and are <br>
supported by neural settings in those higher areas.822<br>
<br>
The effect of the memories is to reset perceptual-processing settings for the next stimuli. <br>
Resetting is automatic and very fast. This picture of the memory involved in priming <br>
belies any view that takes memory, without qualification, to be cognitive. At each level at <br>
which it has an effect, memory involved in priming retains aspects of stimulus repetition <br>
in very primitive ways.<br>
<br>
In my view, the idea that such memory is cognitive—supra-perceptual—is not worth <br>
serious consideration. The idea that the effect of memory on priming constitutes “cogni-<br>
tive penetration” of perceptual processing should not be taken seriously. Both the sim pli-<br>
city of the psychophysical transactions and the locations of their neural bases tell against <br>
taking priming effects to be supra-perceptual. Two individuals with the same type of per-<br>
ceptual system, the same attentive states, and same stimulus input can generate different <br>
perceptual states, because of differences in prior priming. The differences do not derive <br>
from differences in cognitive states.<br>
<br>
I believe that it is not known which unconscious memory systems figure in perceptual <br>
priming. There is evidence that priming extends from briefest to long-term retention, pos-<br>
sibly in a single system taking different forms.823 This chapter treats short-term memory <br>
systems as distinct systems. This approach is mainly an expositional matter. I do not pre-<br>
judge how psychological science will ultimately parse memory kinds.<br><br>

<b>Visual Sensory Memory<br><br>
</div>
</b>The shortest-term types of visual memory are commonly called ‘<i>visual sensory memory</i>’. <br>
Sensory memory also occurs in auditory and tactile modalities. Auditory sensory memory <br>
lasts longer than visual sensory memory, but is broadly similar.824<br><br>

<b>FOOTNOTES</b><br>
<b>Cont FN</b>These effects are anticipatory effects and are established prior to viewing the stimulus. In this sense, they do not <br>
modulate processing during stimulus viewing but bias the process before it starts . . .’. I think that the point is <br>
right in spirit, but is not quite literally right. The models that I described treat some priming as resulting from <br>
interaction between short-term memory and current processing. Processing is affected during stimulus viewing. <br>
The interaction seems not even to be feedback from <i>higher</i> visual <i>perceptual</i> areas, much less interaction with <br>
“cognitive” states. It is local, “horizontal” processing within early visual areas. Relevant types of memory are no <br>
more cognitive than the perceptions that they affect.<br>
