698 Perception and Cognition</div>
<br><br>
Opponents have highlighted many instances of feedback that had not been recognized in <br>
the 1970s. No such cases have, I think, shown anything surprising about relations between <br>
perception and cognition.<br>
<br>
As noted in this chapter, the section Conceptions of Penetration, it has been <br>
known for more than a century that corollary discharge from eye movement figures in <br>
perceptual constancies. It has long been known that eye movement can be “driven” by <br>
propositional states or propositional instructions. So a role for “cognitively driven” cona-<br>
tive task orientation, conative motor commands, anticipatory states in visual processing is <br>
old scientific wisdom.<br>
<br>
Understanding attention has evolved in important ways. Attention’s effects at various <br>
stages in computations of certain “low-level” representations, say of color and orientation, <br>
<i>are</i> a surprise. But few scientists take all types of even endogenous attention (really, <br>
en dogen ous attention commands) to be cognitive. The fact that endogenous attention <br>
affects eye movement, visual set-up, and visual processing, and thereby affects not only the <br>
quality of visual perception, but what is perceived and how it is represented, does not <br>
importantly alter traditional conceptions.<br>
<br>
A role for visual memory in visual categorization has been a constant in theorizing <br>
about categorization from the birth of the science. Since categorization was recognized in <br>
the mid 1990s to be a function and part of perceptual processing, it has been common to <br>
provide a role for <i>perceptual</i> memory, including long-term perceptual memory, in visual <br>
processing.<br>
<br>
Given that perception evolved largely to serve action, task-dependence of endogenous <br>
attention, and hence of perceptual states and processes affected by such attention, is no <br>
surprise. The facts that <i>paradigmatic</i> cognitive states—beliefs, propositional-level inten-<br>
tions—can cause motor commands, help direct attention, guide anticipation, call up <br>
images and visual memories, are staples of common sense. Again, some cases of pene tra-<br>
tion of conceptually initiated attention can, via perceptual-level attention commands, <br>
cause modifications in perceptual processing. But such cases do not affect basic computa-<br>
tional explanations. A notion of perceptual-level kind tied to the system of computation of <br>
perceptual and perceptual-level states comports with conceptions of perceptual system <br>
that go back fifty years. Connection of paradigmatic cognitive states to perception always <br>
goes by way of perceptual-level states that are not themselves perceptual states.<br>
<br>
Opponents of impenetrability sometimes acknowledge this indirectness.1146 Some <br>
defenders of impenetrability seem to think that it weakens opponents’ cases, but rarely say <br>
why. Cognitive states certainly do not figure in an argument. Nor are they <i>necessary</i> fac-<br>
tors in perceptual processing, as New Look psychology claimed. They affect perceptual <br>
processing by affecting some aspect of it—like attention—that is not a perception. Of <br>
course, if penetration is non-pathological causal influence, it is not clear why this point <br>
about indirectness matters.<br>
<br>
Defenders of impenetrability sometimes respond to cases of indirect, non-pathological, <br>
contentful effects of propositional states or visual perception by characterizing such cases <br>
as uninteresting or non-revolutionary. Chaz Firestone and Brian Scholl respond in this <br>
way to many cases of indirect effects of propositional attitudes on visual perceptual states <br><br>
