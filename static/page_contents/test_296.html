296 The Iconic Nature of Perception</div>
<br><br>
attributives are iconic through the iconic shape (size, motion) attributives on which their <br>
identity depends. Similar points apply for the most-generic attributives for <i>face</i>, <i>shape</i>, and <br>
<i>color</i>. All such attributives are iconic.<br>
<br>
Analogous points apply for functional perceptual attributives—for example, any such <br>
attributives for <i>edible</i>, <i>mate</i>, <i>agent</i>, and so on. They too are iconic.<br>
<br>
I take it that representations in realist pictures are iconic and have the same basic struc-<br>
ture as perceptual states. They iconically represent bodies as well as bodies’ shapes. They <br>
can iconically represent food, mates, agents. Structure follows function. Both naturally <br>
drawn/painted pictures of real things and perceptual states function to pick out particu-<br>
lars, partly by characterizing them, partly by bearing relevant causal relations to them. <br>
Functions are determined by capacities, which are evinced by uses. So the basic structure <br>
of both pictures and perceptual states is the same structure that a noun phrase has: applied, <br>
contextual, referential determiners governing attributives. The attributives are iconic in <br>
that their way of characterizing depends on natural mappings to their indicants, as <br>
explained in the next section.<br>
<br>
I state these points for orientation, using an intuitive notion of iconicity. I turn to a <br>
more detailed explication. I recommend beginning without philosophical pre-conceptions <br>
of what iconic representation <i>contrasts</i> with, other than <i>non-iconic</i> representation.<br><br>

<b>Noun-Phrase-Like Structure and Iconic Representation in Perception<br><br>
</div>
</b>Perception is the most basic sub-class of iconic representation.297 Maps, realist pictures, <br>
drawings, photographs, musical notations, diagrams, bar graphs, abacuses, hieroglyphs, <br>
and color chits are further paradigmatic sub-classes.<br><br>

<b>FOOTNOTES</b><br>
<b>Cont FN</b>So, there is group of attributives for <i>impala-body</i> applied only on the basis of attributing impala-shapes and is <br>
accurate only of impala-shaped impala-bodies. Each attributive in the group has its own mode of presentation <br>
that includes a perspective on impala-shape at a given distance and orientation. And there is a group of generic <br>
attributives for bodies—relatively rigid, persisting entities with closed outer-boundaries. Each attributive in the <br>
group has its own mode of presentation of the generic attributive for <i>body</i>. Each mode of presentation depends <br>
on those of the underlying shape attributives. The difference in the categorizing attributives lies in the width of <br>
grouping competence and the degree of uniformity of associated dispositions to action-responses. The variety of <br>
modes of presentation for the generic attributives is, of course, much greater than for the specific attributives for <br>
impala-bodies. Both generic body attributives and impala-body attributives are iconic, inasmuch as they are <br>
applied via plotting their shape, size, and depth in an iconic spatial framework. (See Chapter 7, the section <br>
Minimalism and Iconic Representation in a Spatial Coordinate System, Linkage of <br>
Different Perceptual Attributives in Perceptual Constancies; Chapter 11, the section <br>
Levels of Specificity in Perceptual Categorization.)<br>
297 For introduction to iconic representation in perception, see S. Palmer, ‘Aspects of Representation’, in <br>
E. Rosch and B. Lloyd eds., <i>Computing and Categorization</i> (Hillsdale, NJ: Erlbaum, 1979). For abstract discussion <br>
of iconic representation, see J. Barwise and J. Etchemendy, ‘Heterogeneous Logic’, in J. Glasgow, N. Narayanan, <br>
and B. Chandrasekaran eds., <i>Diagrammatic Reasoning: Cognitive and Computational Perspectives</i> (Menlo Park, <br>
CA: MIT Press, 1995). Neither source provides a general explication of iconicity. Palmer uses the term ‘natural <br>
isomorphism’. Since the environment is always more complex than any representation of it, he is apparently <br>
assuming that the isomorphism is to certain restricted structural aspects of the environment. As do I, Palmer <br>
emphasizes the natural character of the mappings. Appeal to structural mappings from perceptual representa-<br>
tions to aspects of the environment, especially in visual spatial representation, is pervasive in perceptual psych-<br>
ology. The role of structural transformations of visual representations and in visual imagery that map onto <br>
aspects of the environment is richly documented in R. Shepard and L. Cooper, <i>Mental Images and Their <br>
Transformations</i> (Cambridge, MA: MIT Press, 1982); S. Pinker, ‘A Computational Theory of the Mental Imagery <br>
Medium’, in M. Denis, J. Engelkamp, and J. Richardson eds., <i>Cognitive and Neuropsychologial Approaches to <br>
Mental Imagery</i> (Dordrecht: Martinus Nijhorff Publishers, 1988); S. Kosslyn, <i>Image and Mind</i> (Cambridge, MA: <br>
Harvard University Press, 1980). I discuss more evidence for taking perception to be iconic in Chapter 9, the <br>
section Iconic Aspects of Perceptual Spatial Representation.</div>
