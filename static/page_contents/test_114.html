figure in a computation, the computation must operate on the underlying layer. For <br>
 example, if a law involves computation of a perception of one surface as being farther <br>
away than another surface, the computation must operate on an item that does not <i>in itself</i> <br>
represent surfaces or ordinal depth. On this view, what is called in the science a computa-<br>
tion on a perceptual state in fact applies to an underlying item that lacks any specific con-<br>
tent. Some proponents of this view hold, I think preposterously, that taking the syntactic <br>
item to have a specific content in the science is an optional or heuristic matter. Even those <br>
who think that the underlying syntactic items in fact have definite representational con-<br>
tents, hold that the computations are <i>basically</i> operations on those syntactic items not on <br>
states with specific contents. The contents are just carried along on the computational ride.<br>
<br>
Sometimes it is noted that a computer is sensitive only to the shapes of symbols in its <br>
program, not to their meaning. Meaningful symbols are computed, but only because the <br>
shapes that express them are operated upon computationally. The shapes would have been <br>
the same shapes, and there would have been the same computations, even if the shapes <br>
were not given meaning by the programmers. Hence the computational operations of the <br>
machine would have been the same operations even if they had not been given meaning <br>
by the programmers. Perceptual systems are then analogized to the computers.<br>
<br>
The analogy is seductive. But there is no reason to believe that the science is illumined <br>
by this <i>particular</i> analogy to computers. Nothing like the supposed not-specifically-<br>
representational syntactic layer is postulated in the science as the central factor in the <br>
computations that the science describes. In fact, the computational laws are laws of forma-<br>
tion of contentful perceptual states. The non-representational “syntactic” layer is entirely <br>
philosophical ideology.<br>
<br>
Perceptual science takes computational laws to include representational states (or rep-<br>
resentations, or representational contents) as factors in the computational laws. The <br>
specification of computational operations commonly include specification of perceptual <br>
states, or perceptual representations, or perceptual representational kinds—specific repre-<br>
sentational contents, in our terminology. The laws are laws of relations among kinds of <br>
perceptual states. Basic perceptual state kinds are perceptual modes with perceptual repre-<br>
sentational contents. The computational laws connect states of psychological, representa-<br>
tional kinds. Hence the computations operate on states with specific representational <br>
content. To hold that the laws are fundamentally computational patterns among syntactic <br>
items that lack specific representational contents makes nonsense of psychological laws <br>
governing representational states.<br>
<br>
Again, no further layer of states with relevant structure that in themselves lack specific <br>
representational properties is postulated in the science. Postulating them adds nothing to <br>
the laws that are in fact specified. Good scientific and philosophical practice should reject <br>
them. Philosophy should follow science, not try to dictate to it.<br>
<br>
Attempts to support (LOT*) have been drawn entirely from philosophical ideology, not <br>
from reflecting on how the science works. I will not try to rebut all relevant philosophical <br>
initiatives. I indicate just briefly some reasons why I do not find them strong.<br>
<br>
Invoking (LOT*) is commonly motivated by attempts to solve causal aspects of the <br>
mind–body problem. The idea is that we cannot understand causation involving psy cho-<br>
logic al states unless we reinterpret the causation in terms of sensitivity to purely non-<br>
contentful syntactic properties, which are realized physically. No good argument is given <br>
for the claim that understanding psychological causation requires this reinterpretation. </div>
