384 First-Formed Perception</div>
<br><br>
Serial visual searches involve a compound of various capacities beyond first-formed <br>
perception—shifts of attention, short-term memory, for example. These capacities are <br>
applied over longer time periods than those in which first-formed perception occurs. So <br>
search paradigms are not directly relevant to operations involved in first-formed percep-<br>
tion. It was natural to assume that if binding fails at longer periods of exposure, it fails at <br>
shorter periods. The issues turned out much less straightforward than Treisman’s classical <br>
theory represented it as being.<br>
<br>
I sketch development of Treisman’s theory between 1980 and 2005. The 1980 form of <br>
the theory was revised by Treisman in 1988 in response to empirical findings that she <br>
deemed incompatible with the original theory. She continued to revise the theory under <br>
empirical pressure through the 1990s. In the mid-1990s <i>fundamental</i> problems with the <br>
basic picture provided by Treisman’s binding theory began to accumulate from several <br>
lines of experiment. These bodies of work came to support a very different account of the <br>
first stages of visual perception. The account incorporates insights from Treisman’s work, <br>
but shows its main ideas to be mistaken.421<br>
<br>
That is an overview. I turn to specifics of this history.<br>
<br>
1980 and 1982 saw publication of the classic form of Treisman’s theory. Registration of a <br>
proximal stimulus carries information from various informational dimensions—color, <br>
lightness, spatial orientation, direction of motion, and so on. These dimensions are largely <br>
processed in anatomically different streams. There is evidence that processings of informa-<br>
tion in these streams have some functional independence. Detections or registrations of <br>
features or attributes in different subsystems, for the different dimensions, were taken to be <br>
‘separable’ or dissociable. For example, detection of color was taken to be separable from <br>
detection of shape. Both were taken to be separable from detection of the location of a <br>
colored shape.<br>
<br>
In its original presentation, Feature-Integration Theory claimed that visual perceptions <br>
are formed from two functionally independent, sequential processing stages. The first is <br>
pre-attentive. Registrations of a given attribute are coded independently of, and in parallel <br>
to, registrations of attributes in other dimensions. At this stage, registrations in a sub-<br>
system dedicated to detection of an attribute (for example, a color) code presence of <br>
aspects of the optical array relevant to that attribute. Detection of the attribute is carried <br>
out by parallel search of the whole optical array.<br>
<br>
In 1980 Treisman and Gelade held that, at this first stage, a feature detector in a sub-<br>
system dedicated to a particular feature-dimension checks the location of possibly many <br>
registrations of a given feature in parallel—at a given time—and produces a yes-no regis-<br>
tration if a registration of the feature (say, yellow) is detected anywhere in a stimulus array. <br>
Even if there are multiple instances of a feature, only the presence of some instance of <br>
the feature is registered. So no locational information, either retinal-location or <br><br>

421 My account of changes in Treisman’s theory and internal pressures to which it responded is at several <br>
points indebted to P. Quinlan, ‘Visual Feature-Integration Theory: Past, Present, and Future’, <i>Psychological Bulletin</i> <br>
129 (2003), 643–673. Quinlan does not deal with empirical difficulties with the theory that began to arise in the <br>
1990s from ultra-rapid processing and from focus on natural scenes. These are the sources of the theory’s most <br>
significant difficulties. I describe them shortly.</div>
