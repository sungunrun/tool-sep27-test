representational tasks. In spatial representation, there are various origins for anticipatory <br>
representation of the perceiver’s action. Each is an origin for the spatial perception that <br>
guides the action. As I have indicated, there are monocular as well as binocular origins for <br>
spatial representation in mammalian vision.<br>
<br>
The variety of origins in temporal representation seems greater. Many present times are <br>
fixed in a single perception. The different present times, which anchor timings, are most <br>
prominent at very small-time scales. Perhaps they tend to disappear into a single marking <br>
of an erstwhile present time for longer-term perceptual memory. Still, it seems that there <br>
may be many present times that anchor timings relevant to different spatial attributives in <br>
a perception. Temporal representation may be distributed in complex ways over iconic <br>
spatial representation.<br>
<br>
I noted that some of these temporal origins anchor timings that are not metrical and do <br>
not fit into any general temporal framework. They would be entirely one-time, context-<br>
bound timings. Other temporal origins anchor timings that are metrical and hence <br>
 comparable with other timings in the perceptual modality, as well as cross-modally and <br>
amodally. In such cases, although there are many present times in a perception, they are <br>
all starting points of a larger temporal sequence—a sequence that functions to match <br>
objective time and temporal relations. These within-framework cases appear dominant in <br>
representation of temporal scales larger than about 300 ms.<br>
<br>
All markings of present time in perception are representer-centered. The present is <br>
determined by relation to some temporal segment of a perceptual state, or some whole <br>
perceptual state, in a given perceiver. It seems likely that not all these representer-centered <br>
markings of present times are egocentric. It also seems likely that most of these temporary <br>
present-tense markings are not retained in memory. They may be insufficiently connected <br>
to the rest of the perceiver’s psychological competencies to meet these conditions.<br>
<br>
I illustrate some of the points that just made with a visual perceptual representational <br>
content that incorporates temporal representation. The content also involves more than <br>
one present-tense marker. It represents intra-saccadically perceived motion. The percep-<br>
tual content is, of course, abstracted from a much more complex one. It again omits <br>
iconicity.<br><br>

The representational content is accurate if and only if all the referential applications <br>
are successful and all the attributions are veridical of the particulars that they make <br>
 attributions to.<br>
<br>
As with all perceptual representational contents, the one specified here has noun-phrase <br>
form. The two framework egocentric indexes for place and time, (here-cego xp) and (nowego <br>
xt), have equal, widest scope. They share widest scope with the perceptual referential appli-<br>
cations to the purported body and the purported motion. Each egocentric index carries an <br>
application, subscripts p and t respectively, that establishes the anchor for a framework of <br>
representation for perceived particulars. The temporal index marked by subscript t—an <br>
indexical referential application—marks a time interval, say 320 ms. This interval is the </div>
