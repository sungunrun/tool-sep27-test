what they indicate in perception unless they are attributively applied by a referential appli-<br>
cation.) Schematic competencies are exercised only through referential applications. <br>
Exercises of the competencies, the referential applications, in perception do often refer to <br>
particulars, but only by being caused to be exercised occurrently in a context. The compe-<br>
tencies are representational content-types.<br>
<br>
There are at least three, possibly four, types of perceptual schematic representational <br>
competencies, and hence representational contents.<br>
<br>
The most common schematic competence is analogous to the competence to use the <br>
word ‘that’ (except that the uses tend not to be acts and the competence is not symbolic). <br>
Think of the word ‘that’ as a dictionary entry, not being used. It marks a demonstrative, <br>
repeatable, linguistic competence to pick out things in certain contexts via occurrent <i>uses</i> <br>
of the word. Similarly, there is a standing ability or competence, not used at every moment, to <br>
pick out particulars via perception. (There is also a conceptual schematic competence to <br>
pick out <i>representata</i> through thought.) The schematic representational competence and <br>
content are one thing. Any referential application of the schematic content—any exercise <br>
of the competence—is another. They are different constituents in a representational con-<br>
tent. A competence and an exercise of the competence are different psychological elem-<br>
ents, different aspects of a psychological-state-instance. That can be instantiated in a <br>
psychological state without an application. For example, one perceptual competence is a <br>
psychological state in which the demonstrative-like element is present without an applica-<br>
tion. Similarly, for certain types of memory and anticipation. (See Chapters 17 and 18.) Of <br>
course, an application of the repeatable competence cannot occur without instantiating <br>
the competence. In an occurrent <i>perceptual state</i>, the schematic content and an application <br>
of it always occur.<br>
<br>
In specifying these components of a representational content symbolically, I mark the <br>
schematic element with ‘that’ and the referential application with a subscript on ‘that’—<br>
later, on the variable that ‘that’ governs. The occurrent exercise of a schematic referential <br>
competence is specified thus: that1.<br>
<br>
So, in specifying the representational contents of perceptual states, I use distinct sym-<br>
bols for distinct components of the contents. I have to specify the contents in language. To <br>
be perspicuous in the specifications, I use distinct symbols to specify distinct components. <br>
It is not to be supposed, however, that a symbol in the specification of a referential applica-<br>
tion has a corresponding symbol in the representational content. The occurrent exercise of <br>
a referential competence is an event, with no separate symbol for or in the event.<br>
<br>
Even in natural language, occurrent uses of demonstratives are not symbolized. The <br>
demonstrative is a symbol. Its occurrent use is not. In specifying the components of a <br>
truth condition for an occurrently employed sentence containing a demonstrative, one <br>
would do well to mark in symbols a difference between the standing, non-occurrent word <br>
(symbol) ‘that’ and an occurrent use. Among sentences that contain ‘that’, only used ones <br>
have a <i>representatum</i> for ‘that’. Only used ones are true or false. Ultimately, at least in the <br>
case of sentences containing demonstratives, only sentences involving occurrent uses of <br>
‘that’ by a particular speaker, at a particular place and time, are true or false.<br>
<br>
I think that for demonstrative-containing sentences, only sentence occurrences are true <br>
or false. Many semantic theories use the notion true in a context—a relational primitive:<br><br>
