200  Form and Semantics of Perceptual Contents</div>

perceptual memory or perceptual anticipation. I discussed quantification first, because I <br>
thought it important to understand indefinite forms of perceptual memory and perceptual <br>
anticipation if one is to understand cases that might tempt invocation of logical connectives. <br>
I return now to quantification, focusing first on universal quantification.<br>
<br>
In visual search tasks subjects are asked to determine whether all perceived figures in a <br>
display have some property. Sometimes, individuals answer affirmatively. Other times, an <br>
outlier “pops out”. Vision is sensitive to both uniformity and anomalies. The experiments <br>
are carried out with human subjects, given instructions in language. The subjects use <br>
quantifiers. It would be an elementary mistake—but one sometimes made—to think that <br>
because the subjects solve perceptual tasks naturally described in quantificational terms, <br>
their visual systems use quantification. Rather, they use quantifiers in reasoning about and <br>
reporting on their visual perception.<br>
<br>
Again, the representational function of perception is referential, not quantificational or <br>
general. The arguments applied to existential quantification reapply to universal quantifi-<br>
cation. When an individual perceives each figure in an array as having a given property, <br>
the form of the perception is a parallel array of singular referential applications, each <br>
applying the same perceptual attributives. Perhaps there are plural forms, those Fs. There <br>
can be specific responses to all the perceived particulars’ being F, just as there can be spe-<br>
cific responses to a particular’s “popping out”. Similar points apply to perception in natural <br>
scenes. If an impala perceives each moving body as impala-shaped, it relaxes. If it per-<br>
ceives lots of impala-shaped bodies, but one or a few lion-shaped bodies, the exceptions <br>
pop out.<br>
<br>
Such psychological states do not ground postulation of universal quantification in the <br>
content of a perceptual state, even universal quantification restricted to entities in a con-<br>
text ual ly delimited (perceived) array. The psychological responses are to certain types of <br>
referential arrays. Uniformity among perceived objects contrasts with non-uniformity, <br>
especially if the non-uniformity is specific and pops out. The content of perceptual repre-<br>
sentations never functions to generalize over a domain. Perceptual memory and percep-<br>
tual anticipation are similar to perception in this regard. They are in singular or plural <br>
referential form—whether they are indefinite and schematic or have occurrence-based <br>
referential applications and are <i>de re</i>.<br>
<br>
In discussing logical constants in perceptual-level states, I have conspicuously omitted <br>
conjunction. Neither the representational function nor the iconicity of perception is <br>
incompatible with the semantical rules governing propositional conjunction. Nevertheless, <br>
the non-propositional, iconic form of perception is incompatible with the representational <br>
content’s containing conjunction as a true logical connective.<br>
<br>
The representational content of perception does contain a complex of attributions. If all <br>
of these attributions are veridical, then any one of them is. If each member of any pair of <br>
attributions in a perceptual content is veridical, then, assuming binding relations are not <br>
violated, the pair is veridical. So we have analogs in the semantics of perceptual content of <br>
the detachment and adjunction rules for propositional conjunction.<br>
<br>
Analogs of detachment and adjunction figure in perceivers’ psychologies. A psy cho-<br>
logic al system can take a complex perception and single out an attribution within it for <br>
processing. For example, if an individual has a perception as of a brown, impala-shaped <br>
impala-body in a certain location, the system can discard information about color. It can <br>
center on processing, for action, information about an impala-shaped impala-body. Such </div>
