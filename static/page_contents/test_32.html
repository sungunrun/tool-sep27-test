representational contents) in perceivers of certain types. Representations are always <br>
instantiations of representational contents. In fact, I think that our only good way of <br>
understanding representations is as instantiations of representational contents at par-<br>
ticular times in particular psychologies. I return to this issue in Chapter 4, the section <br>
Perception, Computation, and the Language-of-Thought Hypothesis.<br>
<br>
I said that representational contents are always partly or wholly made up of repeatable <br>
types. Why not always wholly? The representational content poachers are deplorable <i>is</i> <br>
wholly made up of parts that are repeatable types. Most belief contents and all the repre-<br>
sentational contents of perception contain one or more representationally relevant parts <br>
that are individuated by occurrences, not types. These are demonstrative-like, or indexical-<br>
like, occurrent, referential applications of a freely repeatable content-type. I discuss these <br>
creatures shortly.<br>
<br>
Representational contents are kinds that ground three explanatory functions.28 That is, <br>
representational contents have three constitutive aspects that figure in the contents’ role in <br>
three types of explanation. Since these aspects are constitutive of representational con-<br>
tents, understanding them is critical for understanding what representational contents are.<br>
<br>
First, representational contents are psychological kinds at the finest grain relevant to <br>
psychological explanation. The representational content of a psychological state—a belief <br>
or perception—is the kind that that state, or event, instantiates. It is the most specific level <br>
of kind by reference to which that state is specified in science’s description of laws in its <br>
causal psychological explanations. For example, if poachers are deplorable is the represen-<br>
tational content of a belief, that content constitutes the kind of belief it is, at the most spe-<br>
cific level of psychological kind that is relevant to scientific description and causal <br>
explanation. If that1 brown cubical surface is the representational content of a visual per-<br>
ception (where the subscript marks a particular occurrent event of applying the demon-<br>
strative capacity), that content constitutes the kind of visual perception that that perception <br>
is, at the finest grain of kind relevant to scientific causal explanation.<br>
<br>
In fact, the full representational content of a psychological state together with the mode <br>
of the state (belief, supposition, doubt, visual perception, auditory perception, and so on) <br>
individuates the state. That is, the state is the state that it is by virtue of its <i>mode</i> and its <br>
<i>representational content</i>. These two features are the most basic, constitutive features of the <br>
state. They are the features that psychological science goes to, when asked what state is at <br>
issue and when giving basic psychological explanations that cite representational states.<br>
<br>
Constituents of representational contents that are <i>types</i> constitute kinds of competen-<br>
cies or capacities that figure in representational states. For example, the representational <br>
content-type rectangular in a visual state is a specific competence to perceptually charac-<br>
terize something as rectangular—say, a surface—in a specific way. Such a competence can <br>
be exercised on many occasions. Similarly, the repeatable representational content-type <br>
that constitutes a perceptual competence to pick out a particular. That specific competence <br>
is exercised in all perceptual states. Of course, each of the competencies that and <br>
rectangular is never exercised alone. They are always exercised in a larger representational <br>
content—that is, in a perceptual state that is a richer, more complex kind. Still, not only <br><br>

<b>Cont FN</b>28 I discuss these functions elsewhere. The earliest such discussion is in my ‘Belief <i>De Re</i>’, section IV. There I <br>
discuss functions of Frege’s notion of sense. That notion is an ancestor of the notion of representational content. <br>
A more recent discussion of these aspects of representational content occurs in my <i>Origins of Objectivity</i>, 37–42.</div>
