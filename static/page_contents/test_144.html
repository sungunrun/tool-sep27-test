144 PercePtual reference requires PercePtual attribution</div>
<br><br>
(Not-AA2) entails that it is possible for a particular to be perceived, even though the per-<br>
ception does not characterize the particular <i>accurately</i> in any way. According to (Not-AA2), <br>
one could succeed in perceiving some particular either while applying no perceptual <br>
attributive at all (as envisaged by (Not-AA1)), or while applying perceptual attributives all <br>
of which fail to be accurate of the perceived particular. I assume that (Not-AA1) has been <br>
ruled out.<br>
<br>
Here is reasoning that supports (AA2) and counts against (Not-AA2). Perception is of <br>
particulars that cause the perception. There are indefinitely many particulars that cause <br>
any given perceptual-state occurrence, indeed any given aspect of a perceptual state. There <br>
are the arrays of light at many distances between the retina and whatever is perceived. <br>
There is the aggregate of photons that make up the light. There is the aggregate of sub-<br>
atomic particles that at a given moment make up whatever is perceived. And so on. A <br>
perceptual system does not—cannot—perceive all of these causes. It cannot <i>perceptually</i> <br>
discriminate all of them. To do so, it would have to perceptually discriminate them from <br>
one another. Perceptual systems clearly cannot do any such thing. If there is to be success-<br>
ful perceptual reference, there must be an exercise of a repeatable perceptual competence <br>
that is proprietary to one or more types of entity, from this welter of types, and that selects <br>
that type or those types as the types of particulars that are perceived. In making such a <br>
selection, the perceptual competence must be accurate of the types of particulars that it <br>
picks out from other types of particulars that it does not or cannot pick out.<br>
<br>
I believe that the premises and transitions in this reasoning are all apriori.<br>
<br>
Selection here just is accurately attributing a property or kind of the perceived object <br>
that differentiates it from the other causes that are not perceived. Usually, the selection is <br>
also from a perceived background. In accurate attribution, the perceptual competence <br>
connects the selected (indicated) property or kind with an instance of the property/kind <br>
that causes the perception.<br>
<br>
The selection need not uniquely characterize the perceived entities. It almost never <br>
does so. Other non-perceived entities may have and certainly could have had the same <br>
property. One could perceive one particular one moment, and an indiscernible substituted <br>
particular the next.<br>
<br>
The accurate attribution can do the relevant selecting, and be accompanied by numer-<br>
ous inaccurate attributions. What singles out a perceived entity is the fact that it causes the <br>
perception (or the relevant aspect of the perception—an occurrent application) <i>together <br>
with</i> the perceptual competence to respond (in a repeatable way) to instances of attributes <br>
that the perceptual competence can respond to. Relevant response is attribution or <br>
characterization.<br>
<br>
(Not-AA2) holds that perception of an entity can succeed, even though there is <i>no</i> exer-<br>
cise of a perceptual competence that accurately characterizes any attribute of the perceived <br>
entity. As we have seen, applying the singular referential application to something that <br>
causes it does not by itself suffice to distinguish a perceived entity from other actual causes <br>
of the same aspect or part of a perceptual state, but that are not perceived. Absent accurate <br>
attribution, (Not-AA2) can appeal to no exercise of a repeatable <i>perceptual</i> competence <br>
that picks out the perceived entity. So (Not-AA2) is incompatible with a perception’s sin-<br>
gling out a perceived entity. It cannot provide a coherent account of perception’s singling <br>
out an entity via some perceptual competence in the cases in which no perceptual at tribu-<br>
tive is accurate of the entity. So (AA2) is true.</div>
