paradigmatically cognitive. Syntactic linguistic competence includes a competence to dis-<br>
tinguish sentences from other linguistic items. Distinguishing propositional structures <br>
differs from using them. Whether syntactic competence counts as propositional is not easy <br>
to determine. Syntactic competence is a candidate for a type of non-propositional cogni-<br>
tion. Whether cognitive, semantical, or syntactic competencies penetrate linguistic percep-<br>
tual systems is a different issue from whether cognitive competencies, of any kind, <br>
penetrate systems of perception of non-linguistic items.<br>
<br>
Examples that involve perception of language are often grouped with examples that bear <br>
on ordinary perception, without comment. One can learn about perception via experiments <br>
that have subjects use language. But understanding such cases requires allowing for the fact <br>
that different perceptual systems, in addition to propositional judgments, are involved. <br>
Interpreting empirical results in such cases requires reflecting on relations between cogni-<br>
tion and the different perceptual systems, linguistic and non-linguistic.1119 Complexity of <br>
the issues forces me to limit discussion to ordinary, non-linguistic perceptual systems.1120<br>
<br>
A third framework issue concerns understanding what counts as a cognitive state. <br>
MacPherson’s (MP) is sometimes taken to be a diagnostic tool for adjudicating cognitive <br>
penetration. (MP) commits to what counts as <i>penetration</i>—a matter to which I shall <br>
return. It provides no insight into what states count as <i>cognitive</i>, or why.1121 As stated earl-<br>
ier, most writing on these topics devotes little attention to the matter. Standard expositions <br>
cite a few examples, always including belief. Other examples are frequently psychological <br>
<i>genera</i> treated as if they were specific cognitive psychological kinds. Chapters 14–18 aimed <br>
at altering this tendency.<br>
<br>
The computational nature of visual processing <i>forces</i> a counterfactual of the sort that <br>
(MP) specifies. It is nearly trivial that if two individuals have the same starting internal <br>
states, both cognitive and non-cognitive, and the same current proximal stimulation, then <br>
bracketing interferences like noise, their visual systems produce the same visual represen-<br>
tational states. (MP) says nothing about possible <i>sources</i> of variation other than current <br>
proximal stimulation, the state of the sensory organs, and “cognitive states”. There are <br>
 others that are overlooked in (MP). There is noise. There is the recent history of adaptation <br>
and priming, which need not involve differences in the state of the sensory organs. No one <br>
should count these differences cognitive.<br>
<br>
Such differences can reside in initial internal states that affect processing. They need not <br>
be penetrators. Other differences—in memory, anticipation, conative state, learning, <br>
imagining, affect, and attentional states—affect what perceptual state is produced. These <br>
facts make it urgent to have some grip on what count as cognitive sources of variation and <br>
what count as non-cognitive sources, if one is to understand issues of cognitive pene tra-<br>
tion. (MP) neither specifies what counts as cognitive, nor lists all sources of <i>known</i> pos-<br>
sible variation that are not cognitive.<br><br>

<b>FOOTNOTES</b><br>
<b>FN</b>1119 Pylyshyn discusses cases of linguistic perception, but his main focus is on non-linguistic perception.<br>
<br>
<b>FN</b>1120 Many have thought that penetration from semantical linguistic understanding (hence cognition) into <br>
speech perception is well established. There is reason to be cautious about such claims. See D. Norris, J. McQueen, <br>
and A. Cutler, ‘Merging Information in Speech Recognition: Feedback is Never Necessary’, <i>Behavioral and Brain <br>
Sciences</i> 23 (2000), 299–370; D. Norris, J. McQueen, and A. Cutler, ‘Prediction, Bayesian Inference and Feedback <br>
in Speech Recognition’, <i>Language, Cognition and Neuroscience</i> 31 (2016), 4–18.<br>
<br>
<b>FN</b>1121 MacPherson is aware that the condition is supposed to illumine what is to count as penetration, not what <br>
is to count as cognition. Her central case centers on a safe case of cognition—belief. So this framework point does <br>
not affect her main argument, although it affects others’ discussion of these issues.</div>
