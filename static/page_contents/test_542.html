that bear referential, indicational, and attributional representational relations to a suitably <br>
<br>
related subject matter.759<br>
<br>
The science is clearly motivated by the goal of helping to explain veridical and non-<br>
<br>
veridical perception. But the idea that there are neatly and easily discernible types in the <br>
<br>
world that match neat categories in perception is an oversimplified idealization at best. <br>
<br>
Not only is a lot of perception inaccurate. Most accurate perception is only approximately <br>
<br>
accurate. . . . The nature and extent of representational matches between the contents of <br>
<br>
perceptual states and the particulars and attributes in the environment are matters of <br>
<br>
empirical investigation. . . . Both the science and anti-individualism are motivated by a <br>
<br>
very <i>general assumption</i>: that individuals’ perceptions are <i>approximately</i> accurate with <br>
<br>
respect to <i>some</i> environmental particulars and attributes <i>enough</i> of the time to ground a <br>
<br>
form of explanation that takes states with veridicality conditions to be the product and <br>
<br>
participants in the law-like formation patterns being explained.760<br><br>
As this latter passage indicates, I do not think that veridical perceptions must be in a <br>
majority in order for veridicality to figure in determining perceptual representational con-<br>
tent. As the elaboration of the first-quoted passage indicates, I do not believe that de ter-<br>
min ation of representational content by veridical perception must occur in the lives of <br>
individual perceivers (compare Block’s ‘our own lives’). I think that an individual perceiver <br>
or group of perceivers at a given time could have <i>nothing but</i> inaccurate perceptions that <br>
are not even approximately accurate—if they were placed in abnormal circumstances. <br>
I believe that <i>most</i> of our perceptions of scalar properties, like size, speed, length, lightness, <br>
saturation, and so on, are slightly inaccurate—only approximately accurate—even in nor-<br>
mal circumstances.761<br>
<br>
I take at face value the experiments that seem to show that covert exogenous attention <br>
frequently degrades accuracy in some ways, even as it enhances perceptual representation <br>
in other ways, say, regarding resolution and speed. Block disagrees with the standard <br>
interpretation of the experiments by psychologists. He counts both attentive and unatten-<br>
tive states accurate. He claims that both represent scalar properties as occurring within an <br>
interval, where the interval just covers the range of apparent estimates. So all normal esti-<br>
mates are within the interval.<br>
<br>
This proposal about accuracy conditions is entirely motivated to avoid what Block <br>
thinks “cannot be right”: since one of the relevant perceptual states would be inaccurate, <br>
inaccuracy would be common. The main consideration that he cites against this view pur-<br>
ports to rest on what I argued. But I have not argued that the result that Block seeks to <br>
avoid “cannot be right”. In fact, I explicitly allowed that it could be right. I believe that it <i>is</i> <br><br>

ciations to veridical representations may be. The discussion of the stated principle stresses that the relation to <br>
veridicality can be very indirect, allowing individuals to make lots of mistakes. What is crucial is that explanation <br>
of what it is to make a mistake with the content of a representational state must ultimately be grounded in veridi-<br>
cal cases. There is, however, no apriori requirement on how frequent the veridical cases must be. In fact, they <br>
need only be important in some way for grounding explanation of what came to be represented—for perception, <br>
often some way that bears on survival long enough to reproduce.<br>
