Accuracy Conditions for Tracking Particulars 253</div>

Specificity in Perceptual Categorization.) With changes in perceptual state <br>
during a tracking—say, across a saccade—there will inevitably be other differences in the <br>
representational content between the later state and the earlier one, besides the difference <br>
in referential applications—at least different times, indexically referred to. Usually, there <br>
will be slightly different spatial perspectives on a body.<br>
<br>
In tracking, memory—often short-term memory—always maintains an index file. <br>
Long-term perceptual memory often loses track of particulars. (See Chapter 17, the sec-<br>
tion Ability-General Long-Term Visual Perceptual Memory.) But some <br>
long-term memory retains index files. Many animals probably have long-term memories <br>
of particulars—humans certainly do. (See Chapter 17, the section Episodic Visual <br>
Memory; <i>De Re</i> Long-Term Non-Episodic Visual Memory.)<br>
<br>
Perceptual constancies for particulars differ significantly from perceptual constancies <br>
for attributes.237 In a perceptual constancy for an attribute, a system of different at tribu-<br>
tives is united in functioning to indicate and attribute a single attribute, or at least approxi-<br>
mately similar attributes. Functioning to indicate an attribute is a standing psychological <br>
capacity. Where there is an indicant for an attributive, representation of that indicant is <br>
coded into the standing attributive capacity. That is, the sameness of <i>representatum</i> is <br>
coded into the linked attributives (into their representational contents) by there being an <br>
ability-general capacity to respond to an attribute-type under different stimulus condi-<br>
tions. The word-like symbols in our formalization mark this commonality.<br>
<br>
In a perceptual constancy for a particular, there is no ability-general psychological <br>
capacity that codes connection to the <i>representatum</i> into the content of a referential appli-<br>
cation. In cases of representational success—picking out a particular—, connection to the <br>
world hinges on occasion-specific causal relations between occurrent aspects of the per-<br>
ceiver’s psychology and environmental particulars outside the perceiver’s psychology. <br>
Then a referential application is connected to its <i>representatum</i> by an occasion-specific <br>
causal chain.<br>
<br>
In both cases, however, a representational capacity or capacity-exercise is marked. In the <br>
attributive case, the word-symbol marks the capacity that connects to the primary focus of <br>
the constancy—the indicant that the attributive functions to attribute. In case of referen-<br>
tial applications, the subscript marks the context-bound exercise of a schematic ability-<br>
general capacity to single out a particular, partly via an occurrent causal chain to it.<br>
<br>
The superscripts also operate differently in the two cases. A superscript on an at tribu-<br>
tive symbol marks a stimulus-type-dependent, ability-general way that a <i>representatum</i> is <br>
represented. For a variable that marks a referential application, a superscript marks a fal-<br>
lible, horizontal psychological function. The function is to connect the occasion-specific <br>
occurrence of the referential application with occasion-specific occurrences of other refer-<br>
ential applications, in tracking a particular. Both types of superscript contribute to the <br>
accuracy condition for the representational component.<br>

<b>Cont FN</b>237 Of course, the two types can be carried out together. See this chapter, the section Minimalism and <br>
Iconic Representation in a Spatial Coordinate System. The perceptual system might represent a <br>
given length through changes in orientation while representationally tracking the same edge and the same <br>
instance of length as it or the perceiver moves. Alternatively, the system could be presented different edges with <br>
different instances of the same length. One could then attribute the length to the different instances of length. <br>
Constancies for attributes do not essentially involve tracking particulars. Constancies for particulars do.</div>
