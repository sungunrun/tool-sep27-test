Attention Commands and Guidance of Saccades 547</div>

Their effects are not explained primarily in terms of the nature of the stimulus. Not all the <br>
foregoing types of attention initiation are attention commands. Some are lower-level, <br>
though principled, endogenous impulses. In the next section, I discuss a case of attention <br>
initiation that affects both visual processing and production of saccades. Such shifts are <br>
guided by a visual priority map. In such cases, attention initiation is explained in terms of <br>
acquired, sometimes temporary, factors in an individual’s psychology. They are initiations <br>
of endogenous attention. Relevant attention and attention shifts are <i>endogenous</i> in the <br>
sense that they are predominantly explained in terms of task-oriented rules internal to the <br>
psychology—rules that can vary with the individual and time, and that are not mainly <br>
explicable exogenously, in terms of the nature of the stimulus or low-level settings of <br>
stimulus reception. Yet they are not always under the individual’s control, much less a <br>
product of conceptual or other supra-perceptual states or commands.<br>
<br>
Second, not all endogenous attention that <i>is</i> under an individual’s control is caused by <br>
conceptual or supra-perceptual initiations—of propositional-level intentions-in-action, <br>
for example. Some individually directed endogenous attention commands are at the repre-<br>
sentational level of perception. They are analogous to the motor commands discussed in <br>
Chapter 14.<br>
<br>
Third, even when there are propositional or other supra-perceptual-level causes of <br>
endogenous attention, they operate through perceptual-level attention commands. And <br>
they are not invoked or needed in computational explanations of initiations of en dogen-<br>
ous perceptual attention. Perceptual-level states such as perceptual memory and percep-<br>
tual attention commands suffice as factors in the computational patterns, without <br>
involving whatever antecedent supra-perceptual-level causes they may have.<br><br>

<b>Perceptual-Level Attention Commands and Guidance of Saccades<br><br>
</div>
</b>Some writers include initiations of endogenous attention on a list of standard supra-<br>
perceptual—cognitive or conceptual—types of representation. In this section, I argue that <br>
initiation of endogenous attention is a genus that includes a perceptual-level species and a <br>
pre-perceptual-level species, as well as supra-perceptual-level species. Here I center on <br>
covert endogenous attention that guides saccades, intra-saccadic scanning, and cross-<br>
saccadic visual-search scanning. Initiations of such attention are perceptual-level, or <br>
lower. They can have cognitive antecedent causes, but they often occur without supra-<br>
perceptual-level antecedent causes.<br>
<br>
Saccades normally occur about three times a second. Attention fixations and attention <br>
shifts occur between saccades and play a large role in determining in what direction a sac-<br>
cade points the eyes toward. After attention is applied overtly to a foveated area, it nor-<br>
mally shifts covertly to a non-foveated area, or to non-foveated features. Shifts of attention <br>
from a foveated area often occur before a motor command causes a saccade. The covert <br>
attention directed toward a peripheral area then helps the motor command and the subse-<br>
quent saccade that ends with foveation of the just-attended-to area or feature.776 When <br><br>
