the environment.979 The change is specific to some aspect of the sensory reception, sen-<br>
sory product, or sensory processing (where ‘sensory’ covers both sensory-non-perceptual <br>
and sensory-perceptual). The restriction to stable change distinguishes perceptual learn-<br>
ing from very short-term changes, often counted <i>adaptation</i>. I know of no sharp, prin-<br>
cipled distinction between perceptual learning and sensory (or perceptual) adaptation. I <br>
follow common usage in the science. Some types of priming are at least borderline <br>
instances of learning.980<br>
<br>
I also follow standard explications in counting relatively stable pre-perceptual sensory <br>
changes that derive from sensory stimulation as perceptual learning, even though the <br>
changes are not perceptual. To count as perceptual learning, such changes must occur in a <br>
perceptual system and affect perceptual processing. This liberality in explication is, of <br>
course, compatible with distinguishing between non-perceptual sensory registration and <br>
perception.<br>
<br>
Pre-perceptual changes in acquisition of sensory information have been found in detec-<br>
tion of differences in spatial frequency, orientation, lightness signals, and scribbles. Some <br>
studies show that individuals can learn to make discriminations that are finer than the <br>
spacing between photo-receptors. Then, the sensory basis for discrimination does not <br>
depend on formation of perceptions or being embedded in perceptual constancies.981 <br>
Such changes do not transfer across orientations, retinal positions, distances. Sometimes <br>
there is just improvement in discriminability.<br>
<br>
Such perceptual learning usually depends on task-oriented attention. Feedback regard-<br>
ing success or failure is not required, but it tends to speed learning. In classically powerful <br>
work, some low-level types of perceptual learning result almost entirely from selective re-<br>
weighting of processing of inputs and reduction of noise—classical effects of applications <br>
of attention.982<br><br>

<b>FN</b>979 This explication draws on scientific explications each of which has some minor defect. ‘The environment’ <br>
can be understood to include the body, for proprioception. See E. Gibson, <i>Principles of Perceptual Learning and <br>
Development</i> (New York: Appleton, 1969); R. Goldstone, ‘Perceptual Learning’, <i>Annual Review of Psychology</i> 49 <br>

of Learning and Motivation</i> 58 (2013), 117–165. Some of these explications err by requiring extended interaction, <br>
ignoring one-stimulus perceptual learning. Some require improvement, whereas there are cases of perceptual <br>
learning that (through frequent exposure to distractors) degrades performance, at least relative to perceivers’ <br>
action targets. See R. Shiffrin and W. Schneider, ‘Controlled and Automatic Human Information Processing. II: <br>
