is reduced and, in the limit case, destroyed. Insensitivity to other sorts of changes—such as <br>
changes in size of objects—also results from the changes’ occurring during a saccades.383<br>
<br>
In the early 1990s, change detection failures were found under further conditions. For <br>
example, blanks could be inserted between successive pictures. Occlusions could be <br>
inserted momentarily while major changes were instituted. Pictures of scenes could be <br>
flickered back and forth. Gradual changes could be undetected, even in central parts of <br>
visual field, while the viewer is distracted by other visual tasks. Major changes, such as <br>
additions or deletions of central objects in scenes, or changes in the identities of people <br>
whom one is looking at, could be instituted under such conditions. In all cases, immediate <br>
awareness of the changes was remarkably absent.<br>
<br>
For example, in the flicker paradigm, a significant difference in a sequentially viewed <br>
pair of pictures—flickered back and forth—is often noticed only after numerous attempts <br>
to find the difference.384 The difficulty in change detection under these circumstances <br>
came to be called ‘change blindness’.385 The difficulty in change detection that arises <br>
because of distractions of attention came to be known as inattentional blindness.386<br>
<br>
Some theories proposed that individuals simply do not see—consciously or other-<br>
wise—or remember—consciously or otherwise—much of a scene. On these views, percep-<br>
tion represents the environment mostly in terms of transient, disconnected collections of <br>
sensory features, such as colors, shapes, and orientations. Such representation was sup-<br>
posed to decay quickly. Any new visual stimulation was supposed to mask the original <br>
representation. Such representation in itself was held to be unable to detect changes that <br>
subjects showed difficulty in detecting. Attention was supposed to be necessary to repre-<br>
sent coherent visual objects either in perception or memory, or both. If attention lapses, <br>
representation of simple objects fails. The visual and memory systems are then left with <br>
representations of scattered features.387 On some views, the impression of visual and <br><br>

Blindness: Past, Present, Future’, <i>Trends in Cognitive Sciences</i> 9 (2005), 16–20, admit that their earlier claims that, <br>
in change-detection failures, the changed items were not initially perceived, lack evidential support. They claim <br>
that change-detection failures can tell one a lot about how visual representation is available for use, but little <br>
about the extent of visual representation. This admission is appropriate. However, given that specific perceptions <br>
can be shown to be retained, though not available to conscious memory, the implication that we know little about <br>
“the extent” of initial visual representation is at best misleading. As we shall see, a lot has been learned about what <br>
is perceived and retained. Forced-choice recognition tests and other experiments show that the initial perception, <br>
and unconscious perceptual memory, are rich, especially when initial presentations are not extremely brief.</div>
