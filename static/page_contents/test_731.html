What Should Count as Cognition? 731</div>

need not be propositional. A rule for transitive operation could take as input any relational <br>
attributive, including relational perceptual attributives. I leave open whether transitive <br>
operations occur in non-human animals.1192<br>
<br>
A further area to investigate is <i>proto-mathematical operations</i>. I lay aside the issue of <br>
analog representation or registration of numerosity here—the capacity to respond to dif-<br>
ferences in ratios of set sizes of perceived or pre-perceptually registered entities. I doubt <br>
that the most basic numerosity representation, or registration, is cognitive. Many numer-<br>
osity responses may even be pre-perceptual. (See note 567.) I focus on digital capacities <br>
that mark early stages in the development of simple arithmetical competencies in human <br>
children.<br>
<br>
The development is slow. Only at ages 5–6 are children proficient both in representing <br>
the successor function (adding 1) and in treating numbers in a count list as cardinalities of <br>
sets or aggregates. Tracking the developmental stages is complex and disputed.1193<br>
<br>
Children begin this development, at around age 2, by learning an ordered list, somewhat <br>
as they learn and recite the alphabet.1194 At first, the list lacks representational content. <br>
Children learn it as a way of producing sounds or shapes in a specific order. At first, the list <br>
is short.<br>
<br>
At about the same time, children learn to point to objects as they proceed through the <br>
list. For each sound or shape on the list, they come to point to a distinct object. This is <br>
called ‘one-one tagging’. They also come to recognize that the order in which objects are <br>
tagged is irrelevant.1195 These procedures enable children at about 2½ years old to utter the <br>
sound on the list whose place in the order corresponds to the cardinality of the set or <br>
aggregate of objects that are pointed at. When children are asked ‘how many?’ after carry-<br>
ing out this procedure, they repeat the last item that they have uttered on the list.<br>
<br>
There is evidence, however, that at this stage children do not understand that the last <br>
item uttered represents the cardinality of the set or aggregate. They often deny that there <br>
are <i>n</i> objects ‘altogether’, where <i>n</i> is the last uttered item. They cannot produce a number <br>
of taps that corresponds to the number of items uttered (or the ordinal number in list-<br>
order of the last item uttered). They cannot give someone the number of items superfi-<br>
cially specified by the child’s number word. So, if asked to hand over the number of objects <br>
in the set or aggregate each of whose members has been pointed to and correlated with an <br><br>
