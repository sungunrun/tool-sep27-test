from the effector body-parts to the target is computed. These materials are the basis for a <br>
motor command that causes the effector body-parts to move in a specific way toward the <br>
target. The target-setting state helps cause the motor command. Their contents are made <br>
accurate if and only if the action hits the target as a result of realization of the motor com-<br>
petence through which the target-setting state and motor command cause the action.<br>
<br>
In the simplest cases, such as a successful, fast reach, the action makes the initial cona-<br>
tive states accurate. In most cases, the psychological structure of the action is more com-<br>
plex. Either the initial motor command fails in some minor way to reach its objective. For <br>
example, the initial reach comes up slightly short of the target. Or that command requires <br>
rechecking and monitoring. For example, one might need to recalibrate after getting <br>
around an unanticipated obstacle.<br>
<br>
Usually, relatively primitive conation relies on re-tuning of feedback loops and new <br>
motor commands, if the target-setting state is to be made accurate. Three types of feed-<br>
back loop occur.<br>
<br>
One is the set of sensory records of the state of the effector body-part after the initial <br>
motor command is issued. Such records come from all relevant senses. For example, the <br>
initial motor command causes the position of the effector body-part to change. <br>
Proprioceptive representation of the effector body-part in its new position is fed back for <br>
recalibration. If the agent can see the body-part, say the hand, a record of that perception <br>
is fed, after a first-stage movement, via short-term memory, back to the motor-command <br>
center for recalibration. There is non-perceptual sensory feedback. Registrations from <br>
stress on joints or muscle stretch, when they are not already incorporated into a proprio-<br>
ceptive perceptual representation, provide further sensory monitoring of results of the <br>
initial motor command. Various records of bodily changes that result from the action on <br>
the initial motor command must be integrated. For example, feedback from propriocep-<br>
tion may be converted (again) into visual spatial coordinates, so that vision can continue <br>
to guide the action to a target.<br>
<br>
A second loop carries feedback from perceptual monitoring of the target and its rela-<br>
tion to the perceiver. If the target-object moves after an initial motor command, and the <br>
movement is perceived, this perception is a factor in follow-up motor commands. <br>
Perception of such movement generates anticipation of future target positions. The antici-<br>
pation is fed back to the motor control center and affects computations of a follow-up <br>
motor command. Such a pattern figures in agents’ unconsciously shifting reach trajectory <br>
if an object moves after the first motor command. Similarly, if a perceiver’s eyes shift direc-<br>
tion so that the target goes out of view, the system must disregard new perceptions and <br>
rely on perceptual memory deriving from initial target perceptions.<br>
<br>
A third type of feedback loop is efference copy. The first two types are generated after <br>
the motor command is issued. This type is produced by the motor command. Along with <br>
effects (such as adaptation) remaining from past acts or sensory records, and with sensory <br>
input from the first type of feedback loop, efference copy yields input into producing <br>
anticipation of the future state of the effector body-part. If input from the first or second <br>
types of feedback comes too late to affect a new motor command, it is stored for use if a <br>
new motor command is needed to fulfill a task.715<br><br>
