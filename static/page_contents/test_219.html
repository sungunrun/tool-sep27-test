system does not simply average the total illumination across the whole scene, but draws its <br>
responses from fixations on relatively few surfaces across illumination changes.<br>
<br>
There is structure to the responses. Responses vary with the ensemble of surfaces in the <br>
scene and with the chromatic direction of the illumination change. For example, there is a <br>
“blue bias”. Insensitivity or tolerance to changes in illumination in the bluer illumination <br>
change-direction is greater, on average, than in other chromatic directions. This bias is not <br>
yet understood. Visual systems may have evolved to be less sensitive to illumination <br>
changes that are most likely in the natural environment. This view would not require that <br>
vision attributes specific illumination bands. It is also possible that visual systems store <br>
registrations of the statistics of natural daylights. Such registration might then influence <br>
attributions of specific illumination values—at least in large spectral bands. There is some <br>
sketchy evidence for this latter possibility.215 If there is an illumination constancy, it yields <br>
representation of much less specific bands of illumination color, specifically hue, than <br>
color constancy does. It is not known how any such units are stored and used. It is not <br>
even known whether specific bands are registered or attributed in a way that would consti-<br>
tute a repeatable competence, or simply distinguished relative to one another on specific <br>
occasions. In any case, any illumination constancy is not a simple dual of color constancy, <br>
as size and distance constancies seem at least close to being—bearing a relatively simple <br>
complimentary relation to one another. It may even be that illumination registration is a <br>
borderline case of a perceptual constancy—hence a borderline case of the perceptual/non-<br>
perceptual-sensory-registration distinction.<br>
<br>
However these matters turn out, the complexities already sketched count against the <br>
idea that there is always one attributive for an attribute in perceptual constancies. Color/<br>
lightness constancy and defocus are complications that cannot be accounted for by the <br>
simple idea that each attributed attribute corresponds to one attributive. Perceptual con-<br>
stancies depend not only on what is attributed, but on how. They depend on perceptual <br>
differences in modes of presentation. I next argue that, for each spatial attribute, there are <br>
many perceptual attributives for that attribute.<br><br>

<b>Minimalism and Iconic Representation in a Spatial Coordinate System<br><br>
</div>
</b>A third reason for rejecting minimalism is independent of the just-discussed cases. It is <br>
perhaps the most basic. Minimalism fails to appreciate the iconicity of perceptual repre-<br>
sentation. It fails to recognize the way in which attributives are psychological capacities <br>
formed from very specific stimuli. It thereby fails to understand the real nature of percep-<br>
tual constancies.<br>
<br>
Visual, tactile, and auditory perception normally occur in an egocentrically anchored, <br>
spatial coordinate system. If a perceptual system meets three conditions, there are in ev it-<br>
ably multiple attributives in a perceptual system for any represented spatial attribute. <br>
Ordinary perceptual systems, certainly visual perceptual systems, meet these conditions.<br>
<br>
I begin by illustrating this point about the multiplicity of perceptual attributives for any <br>
given spatial perceptual indicant by reference to non-relational spatial attributes, like a <br><br>
