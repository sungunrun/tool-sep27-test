Representation and Information Registration 25</div>
<br><br>
in terms of information registration, and causally in terms of the physiology of the sens-<br>
ing. An earthworm does not represent or perceive anything via its heat sensors. If they <br>
were artificially stimulated, they would yield states that would not successfully realize bio-<br>
logic al functions. The main function is to correlate with environmental heat to guide its <br>
behavior in a fitness-conducive way. This function would not be realized. The earthworm’s <br>
heat-protective activity would not be functional.<br>
<br>
In the artificial-heating case, there is a biological failure. The failure is easily conflated <br>
with failure of perceptual inaccuracy. Again, these failures differ. One might reply that, <br>
intuitively, there are two failures—the failure to realize a biological function and the  failure <br>
of inaccuracy. I do not think it clear that the earthworm’s sensing heat is accurate repre-<br>
sentation, as distinguished from functional sensory connection to the environmental <br>
parameter.<br>
<br>
In any case, intuition here is not reliable. Whether or not it is intuitive that there are two <br>
failures, such a view is not well grounded scientifically. There is scientific basis for explain-<br>
ing an earthworm’s heat-sensing partly in terms of biological function. The attribution of <br>
failure in realizing biological function is scientifically grounded. No biological or psy cho-<br>
logic al science systematically attributes accuracy or inaccuracy in its basic <i>causal</i> ex plan-<br>
ations of heat-sensing by earthworms. The divide between sensing that engages purely in <br>
information registration and perception that represents accurately or inaccurately is <br>
marked in scientific explanations, as we shall see. There is scientific ground that outweighs <br>
any intuition in judging cases like the earthworm’s.<br>
<br>
Attributing representation to any animal is a significant explanatory step. Not all of an <br>
animal’s states and activities are explained in representational terms. Earthworms’ sensing <br>
heat, not to mention bacteria or mollusc’s sensing light, or hydra’s sensing contact are not <br>
explained representationally. The physiological and informational-registrational (functional) <br>
explanations seem to suffice. I shall assume that it is a mistake to attribute representational, <br>
perceptual states to the earthworm to account for its capacities for sensing heat.<br>
<br>
There are two kinds of failure—failure in realizing a biological function and representa-<br>
tional failure, failure in veridicality. The notions of failure and success are teleological <br>
notions. There <i>is</i> representational failure. In perception, things are presented as being cer-<br>
tain ways. We perceive a surface to be brown and rectangular. Sometimes things are not <br>
those ways—or no relevant “things” are perceived at all. Then representation fails. There is <br>
something wrong with the perception: it fails to be accurate. In belief, things are also pre-<br>
sented as being certain ways. Sometimes, they are not those ways. Then there is a failure in <br>
the belief. There is a type of failure for both perception and belief if they are not veridical.<br>
<br>
Success and failure entail purposes, action targets, or functions that are realized or not <br>
realized.22 Perceptions and beliefs do not themselves have purposes or action targets. So <br>
the success or failure of a perception or a belief that consists in its being veridical or non-<br>
veridical is a success or failure in realizing a function. We have just seen that the function <br>
is not a biological function, or other practical function. I call the relevant function a ‘<i>repre­<br>
sentational function</i>’. It is apriori and essential to the nature of perception and belief that <br>
they have representational functions that are realized when they are veridical and not real-<br>
ized when they are non-veridical.<br><br>
