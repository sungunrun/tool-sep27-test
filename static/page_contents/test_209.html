Constancies and Frege’s Sense vs– <i>Bedeutung</i> Similarities 209</div>

truth, assuming only that ‘the Morning Star’ has a referent. The truth of (a-b) was an astro-<br>
nomical discovery, even after it was known that each term had a referent. (a-a) and (a-b) <br>
clearly have different cognitive values. Understanding ‘the Morning Star is identical with <br>
the Morning Star’ is a different kind of understanding from understanding ‘the Morning <br>
Star is identical with the Evening Star’. Different psychological states of understanding are <br>
involved. Understanding the latter can be different knowledge than understanding <br>
the former.<br>
<br>
Frege postulated, in addition to the <i>referent</i> of the two singular terms (‘the Morning <br>
Star’ and ‘the Evening Star’), which is the same for each term, different <i>senses</i> expressed by <br>
the terms. By ‘<i>sense</i>’ Frege meant a way of thinking or a type of possible understanding <br>
that is expressed in language. Senses that are ability-general sub-components of complete <br>
thoughts are counterparts of what I call ‘concepts’. I do not think that all concepts are <br>
expressed in a language.<br>
<br>
Frege’s primary interest was the nature of scientific (principally, mathematical) thought. <br>
The language that he took senses to be expressed by was a purportedly ideal language for <br>
science and mathematics. His interest in natural language was secondary. One should not <br>
assume, either in understanding Frege or for purposes of extending Frege’s insights, that <br>
the non-complex dummy letters ‘<i>a</i>’ and ‘<i>b</i>’ must represent non-complex thought or per-<br>
ceptual components. In fact, all of Frege’s examples suggest that he thought that the senses, <br>
the concepts, expressed by pieces of language that stand in for such singular-term letters, <br>
are complex. I think that he thought that, in an ideal language for expressing scientific <br>
thought, it would never be the case that both of the singular expressions that substitute for <br>
the dummy letters express simple thought components.203<br>
<br>
The point of Frege’s example was to show that different ways of understanding and <br>
thinking can refer to the same <i>representatum</i>. The different ways of understanding and <br>
thinking represent the common <i>representatum</i> in different ways. Frege’s example expressed <br>
the insight that a theory of thought must distinguish clearly between the components of <br>
representational thought content (for example, concepts or singular representational con-<br>
tents) and the entities in the world (attributes and particulars) that the components func-<br>
tion to represent (or in his terms, determine).<br>
<br>
Frege’s example provides a tool for distinguishing thought components. If a thought <br>
expressed by ‘<i>a = b</i>’ differs in cognitive value from a thought expressed by ‘<i>a = a</i>’, then a <br>
representational distinction must be acknowledged in the thought components expressed <br>
by ‘<i>a</i>’ and ‘<i>b</i>’. If one could hesitate over whether to believe a = b while believing a = a, the <br>
thoughts have different components. Similarly, if the thought a = b could be connected <br><br>

<b>FOOTNOTES</b><br>
<b>Cont FN</b>203 Frege held this view because he thought that in a perfect language for expressing an ideal science, one <br>
would never need more than one primitive for designating any property, kind, or relation. In his terms, one <br>
would never need more than one primitive for denoting any function in more than one primitive way. He also <br>
thought that in the mathematics of number, all singular reference is via complex definite descriptions. (He may <br>
have held a different view for geometry.) I do not hold this view. I think that numerals, and kind names in natural <br>
science, are singular and sometimes non-complex. Since I am less focused on the extreme idealization of a per-<br>
fect language than Frege was, I think that actual mathematics and empirical science may sometimes designate the <br>
same function (or property or relation) with different primitives. Certainly, in actual languages and actual think-<br>
ing, there are non-complex concepts that produce Frege cases. The thought mercury is identical with mercury <br>
and the thought mercury is identical with quicksilver are different thoughts. Mercury and quicksilver are differ-<br>
ent primitive concepts that name or, in other contexts, indicate the same kind. Similarly for gorse is gorse and <br>
gorse is furze. The main point in the text is that ‘<i>a</i>’ and ‘<i>b</i>’ <i>can</i> stand for complex singular representations. I think <br>
that <i>all</i> representations that mark perceptual states are complex and singular.</div>
