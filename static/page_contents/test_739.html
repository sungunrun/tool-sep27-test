Empirical Characteristics of First-Formed Perceptions 739</div>

perception plays a massive role in numerous contexts.1205 The range and power of uncon-<br>
scious perceptual representation is underestimated in intuitive reflection. Sometimes <br>
unconscious perception is less accurate than counterpart conscious perception. Sometimes <br>
not. Relations between perception and accuracy can only be understood empirically.<br>
<br>
The dominantly feed-forward processing that first forms perceptual sketches is supple-<br>
mented by later-arriving high-frequency information that fills in detail. Processing is also <br>
enhanced through mounting feedback from other capacities in the visual system—mainly <br>
from scene-gist perceptions, from memory, and from endogenous attention that tunes <br>
for task relevance. Comparisons among different specialized aspects of processing also <br>
occur. Such supplements produce more refined shape-representation and more specific <br>
categorization.<br>
<br>
One must always remember that the visual system evolved to serve action and reaction. <br>
Speed of formation and reliance on sketch-like representation in first-formed perception <br>
is clearly an accommodation to the survival value of quickly obtaining information about <br>
the spatial arrangement, size, and rough shape of particulars that could be threatening or <br>
supportive. Refinement of initial sketch-like representations is geared to performing tasks <br>
in more specific, precise ways, once the need to react under existential exigency has passed.<br>
<br>
The fundamental fact that perception was molded to serve action and reaction must <br>
constrain over-rating the autonomy of perceptual representation. I criticized philo soph-<br>
ic al views that take perceptual representations to be <i>constitutively</i>  reliably accurate, or reli-<br>
ably approximately accurate. (See Chapter 15, the section Attention and <br>
Accuracy.)1206 There could not possibly be a good apriori argument that perception <br>
must have any specific degree or proportion of accuracy. Accuracy is just one biologically <br>
useful factor. There are physical limitations on accuracy—noise and acuity. There are <br>
 limits on the biological practicality of accuracy. Needs to speedily represent danger and <br>
op por tun ities can make reliable inaccuracy functional.<br>
<br>
Similar points apply to other intuitive assumptions about perception and accuracy. <br>
It has been thought that attention must improve accuracy. It commonly does. Sometimes, <br>
however, it produces inaccuracy in the interests of making important distinctions easier to <br>
respond to. Accuracy is traded for practical advantage in other cases—such as limitations <br>
on resources.<br>
<br>
Representational content requires <i>some</i> grounding in accurate representation.1207 But <br>
there is no apriori restriction on how often biological function cuts against perceptual <br>
accuracy. Perceptions are accurate, or close to accurate, in enough situations to ground a <br>
science centered on states with accuracy conditions. In an important class of cases, pri-<br>
mate perception is as accurate as physical limitations allow—that is, amazingly accurate. <br>
(See note 57.) Such results are found empirically, not by philosophical argument.<br>
<br>
The fact that biological practicality molded perception not only grounds corrections on <br>
intuitive philosophical thinking. It has also inspired simplistic overstatements of the role <br>
of action and reaction in understanding perception. (See Chapter 14, the section Action <br>
Imperialism.) The worst exhibition of this tendency has been a wave of attempts to <br><br>
