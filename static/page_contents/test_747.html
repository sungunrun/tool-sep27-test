Perception: The Seed of New Things to Live and Die For 747</div>
<br><br>
Picking out and tracking particulars is possible only via their attributes. Organisms can <br>
use perception to respond to particulars in ways appropriate to their status as food, mates, <br>
obstacles, or predators only insofar as perception not only picks out particulars but char-<br>
acterizes them. Picking out (reference) and characterization (attribution) served use.<br>
<br>
These capacities were exercised for millions of years in simple creatures before the <br>
advent of propositional thought. I want to conclude by saying more about the new <br>
 functions that these capacities brought into the world.<br>
<br>
Fulfilling any function is a type of success. Functions entail norms—standards for suc-<br>
cess in realizing a function, purpose, or goal. Fulfilling a function is a type of good. <br>
Biological and representational functions, and their basic norms, are <i>natural</i> functions <br>
and <i>natural</i> norms. They are natural in the sense that they are in place whether or not <br>
anyone knows or cares about them. Natural functions and natural norms have that sort of <br>
objectivity. Animals that live long enough to reproduce realize an objective success, an <br>
objective biological good, even if no being knows of or cares about their success. Accurate <br>
perception achieves an objective success, even if no one, let alone the perceiver, knows or <br>
cares about it.<br>
<br>
Insects have occupied the earth for about a half billion years. I do not know whether the <br>
first insects had perception or whether extinct insect-ancestors had perception. Insects <br>
with perception have certainly been around for a good portion of that time. Early per-<br>
ceivers did not know or care about their representational successes and failures. All living <br>
and dying were for biological functions. But the new type of state, with a new function and <br>
with conditions for a new type of objective success besides biological success, entered a <br>
wedge. It slipped a new possibility for success into the lives of creatures with representa-<br>
tional minds, even the rudimentary minds of perceivers many millions of years ago. Such <br>
is the dominance of biological needs and functions in the lives of animals, that no indi-<br>
viduals could live or die for objective representational success until they recognized repre-<br>
sentation as a distinct capacity and could distinguish representational functions from <br>
biological functions.<br>
<br>
Such recognition required cognition, including propositional capacities. In fact, recog-<br>
nizing the distinction between the two sorts of functions, and the two sorts of successes in <br>
fulfilling them, required <i>meta</i>-representation and concepts for such attributes as <i>function</i>, <br>
<i>norm</i>, <i>good</i> (<i>success</i>), <i>accuracy</i>, <i>truth</i>, <i>belief</i>, <i>perception,</i> <i>representation</i>. These developments <br>
required expanding representation well beyond its perceptual-level role of picking out <br>
particulars.<br>
<br>
When this expansion occurred is unknown. It is unknown partly because we do not yet <br>
understand very well the higher psychologies of the more advanced animals, especially <br>
humans. An important issue is what new capacities enabled higher animals or humans to <br>
free attribution from having a single role—that of guiding reference to particulars. Logical <br>
operations—negation, disjunction, conditionalization, and quantification—do so. Some <br>
mathematical operations do so. Representation of relations among relations does so. <br>
Development of meta-representation that enabled individuals to discover functions, <br>
norms, goods, psychological states, and representations is a further step. This development <br>
probably included development of self-consciousness. This last package almost surely <br>
came late in the development of human beings.<br>
<br>
In any case, success in representation is an objective good that offers an alternative to <br>
living and dying to fulfill biological needs and functions. Once capacities to realize </div>
