also incompatible with the science. As I indicated above in the section PercePtion, <br>
ComPutation, and the Language-of-Thought HyPotheSiS, there is no sci-<br>
entific basis for assuming that perceptual attributives are expressed by symbols. Rather, <br>
attributives are kinds of psychological competencies.<br>
<br>
One might suggest that, instead of a generic color attributive, there is a restriction in the <br>
perceptual system’s architecture of certain referential applications and certain attributive <br>
competencies (like the competence to attribute <i>brown</i>) to colors. Or, to put it another way, <br>
there is a system for generating color attributives, but no generic color attributive.<br>
<br>
There is certainly a sub-system in many perceptual systems that is dedicated to color <br>
processing. There is commonly a similar sub-system dedicated to shape processing. I think <br>
that the suggestion draws a distinction without a psychological difference. A perceptual <br>
attributive just is a competence to respond perceptually to instances of a certain type, <br>
where exercises of the competence can be evaluated for accuracy. The presence of a <br>
 competence to respond to colors in accuracy-evaluable ways insures presence of generic <br>
color attribution.<br>
<br>
Similar points apply to a hierarchy of shape attributives, including generic attributives <br>
for shape. In accurately seeing an approximate cube with a specific, not-fully-regular shape, <br>
the system can produce a very shape-specific attributive for that approximately cubical <br>
shape. That shape might be grouped with other approximations to being cubical—each of <br>
which is perceived as a different specific shape—as being (approximately) cubical. Because <br>
it is a distinct kind of perceptual competence, that grouping constitutes a distinct percep-<br>
tual attributive. Grouping can amount to no more than systematically treating perceivably <br>
different instances alike in certain contexts. An attributive applies to a generic shape whose <br>
sub-species are attributed by more specific perceptual attributives. It does so because an <br>
attributive just is a repeatable representational capacity. By hypothesis, the “treating alike” <br>
just described is a repeatable representational capacity. All such approximate cubes might <br>
be grouped, within the perceptual system’s repertoire of attributives, as instances of a yet <br>
more generic 3-D volume shape—3-D shapes with a connected outer boundary.<br>
<br>
The preceding discussion suggests five levels of perceptual shape attributives. There is <br>
nothing privileged about the number five. Empirical work will probably discover many <br>
more. The enumeration is just illustrative. The first level consists of attributives for the <br>
most specific, discernible shapes. The second consists of attributives that group approxi-<br>
mate, say, cubical shapes, each with its specific irregularities, sizes, and so on. The third <br>
consists of attributives that group not only those approximate cubes, but all other perceiv-<br>
able 3-D volume shapes with closed boundaries. The fourth consists of attributives that <br>
apply to all 3-D volume shapes, including shapes of pluralities, like flocks, that lack closed <br>
boundaries. The fifth consists of attributives that apply to all shapes—3-D volume shapes, <br>
shapes of surfaces, and shapes of edges. Of course, at each level there are many attributives, <br>
because each attributive at a given level is embedded in a perceptual constancy. In subse-<br>
quent discussions of categorization, I consider detailed work on shape levels in grounding <br>
attribution of body kinds.<br>
<br>
So perceptual attributives come in ranges, at different levels of specificity in each range. <br>
One way of distinguishing ranges is to consider limits on misperception. One cannot mis-<br>
perceive an instance of a color <i>only</i> as an instance of a surface. That is, one cannot perceive <br>
the color-instance, but attribute to it only a shaped surface. One cannot perceive an <br>
instance of a shape, but misperceive it only as having, or being an instance of, a color that </div>
