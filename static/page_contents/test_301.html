as natural by the fact that natural sciences study spatial relations. In the day–night cycle of <br>
a registration system, the natural correspondence is temporal. A constraint on a natural <br>
relation is that it not be <i>in itself</i> a representational relation.<br>
<br>
Metrical or topological relations in spatial arrangements, relations of intensity among <br>
light reflectances or among sounds, temporal relations, relations of comparative size or <br>
speed, relations of natural parts to natural wholes, relations of sound pitch or degree of <br>
pressure are examples of natural physical relations. The idea of natural mathematical rela-<br>
tions is less obvious. Simple operations on or relations among the natural numbers (doub-<br>
ling, adding two, dividing by two, factorization, just-as-many-as) are clear examples of <br>
natural relations. Inevitably, what counts as mathematically natural depends on degree of <br>
expertise and amount of background knowledge. So for mathematical naturalness, <br>
natural-for, is part of the intuitive conception.<br>
<br>
I conjecture that the intuitive notion of naturalness used in clauses (1) and (2) relies on <br>
a notion of natural-for only in the case of logic or mathematics. The reason why the notion <br>
of natural-for is inevitable in an intuitive notion of naturalness for mathematics is that <i>all</i> <br>
relations represented in mathematical terms are apriori and necessary. Not so for repre-<br>
sentations of natural relations outside of mathematics, even in the empirical sciences. <br>
Intuitively, some mathematical representation is iconic and some is not. I think that the <br>
distinction depends on <i>natural-for</i>, as a supplement to <i>natural</i> in that case.<br>
<br>
Natural mappings are not <i>in themselves</i> representational mappings<i>.</i>302 This point fol-<br>
lows from the fact that non-representational sensory registrations can be iconic. Being <br>
iconic is a non-representational feature of representation or representational content. <br>
When <i>representation</i> is iconic, iconicity is an aspect of how a <i>representatum</i> is represented, <br>
an aspect of its mode of presentation. The natural mappings that make representation <br>
iconic are prior to and independent of whether they are co-opted by representation.<br>
<br>
Similarly, the iconicity of a type of sensory information registration is not in itself sen-<br>
sory information registration. Causation plays no role in what it is to be iconic. However, <br>
causation is partly constitutive of any <i>sensory</i> state’s registering information. The natural <br>
mappings that make representation and sensory information registration iconic are prior. <br>
They mark representation and sensory information registration when these natural <br>
mappings are incorporated into a mode of representation, or are part how information <br>
is registered.<br>
<br>
Natural mappings may be selected by <i>convention</i> for some use, including representa-<br>
tional use. So being iconic does not exclude being conventional. Natural mappings them-<br>
selves are not established by convention. They exist and are natural independently of <br>
convention. An iconic representation’s being a representation can depend on convention. <br>
The use of dots and lines, even apart from the names, to represent stations and tracks, in <br>
the light-rail map example, is conventional. The natural mapping relations were selected <br>
conventionally for representational use. The natural mapping relations that the convention <br>
utilizes—the mapping between spatial relations among the dots and lines and spatial <br>
 relations among the stations and tracks—are not conventional. They do not result from <br><br>

<b>FOOTNOTES</b><br>
<b>Cont FN</b>302 Natural mappings are close cousins of what Grice called natural meaning. See H. Grice, ‘Meaning’, <i>The <br>
Philosophical Review</i> 66 (1957), 377–388. Linguistic predicates map systematically into properties that they indi-<br>
cate, and extensions that they have. But <i>indication</i>, <i>having</i>, and <i>attribution</i>  are not natural relations. In fact, rep-<br>
resentational relations are an intended contrast class for natural relations. Representational relations are roughly <br>
what Grice called ‘non-natural’ meaning. I do not accept his <i>account</i>  of non-natural meaning.</div>
