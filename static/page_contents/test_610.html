610 Perceptual Long-Term Memory</div>
<br><br>
5 days, subjects were given forced-choice tests. They recognized most of the photographs. <br>
Correcting for guessing, the result suggests retention of approximately 6600 <br>
photographs.945<br>
<br>
In the initial experiments, the photographs were rather different from one another. <br>
Many psychologists proposed that only their gist was remembered. Later studies showed, <br>
however, that substantial detail is retained.946 Scenes are not remembered with photo-<br>
graphic detail. But a lot of detail, especially regarding salient, interesting aspects of a scene, <br>
such as a bedroom and many of its objects in their spatial relations, are retained. Modern <br>
science of long-term visual memory takes relevant memories to be stored in iconic form. <br>
There is also no essential appeal to propositional capacities in accounts of the mechanisms <br>
of retention or the nature of the iconic representations. Experiments track <i>perceptual</i> <br>
VLTM, though VLTM also retains propositional/conceptual contents. Humans can express <br>
what they remember in conceptual, indeed linguistic, form.<br>
<br>
Extrapolation from similar cases has led to a view in the science that there is no evident <br>
upper bound on the capacity to store information in visual long-term memory. Long-term <br>
memory is more obviously limited by relatively small differences among entities to be <br>
remembered (roughly, crowding) than by amount of visual information. Retention of per-<br>
ceptual representation in visual long-term memory can last a life-time.<br>
<br>
Several factors enter into forgetting—normal decay and various types of interference. <br>
Details of particular events or scenes are lost before more general, salient aspects are.947 In <br>
some forgetting, memory traces are lost. In other cases, access to memories becomes diffi-<br>
cult. Memory researchers use subtle methods to distinguish these cases.948<br>
<br>
The characterization of visual long-term memory that opened this chapter centers on <br>
length of retention. Two aspects of this characterization deserve comment.<br>
<br>
One is that visual long-term memory is not distinguished from VWM via a passive-<br>
active distinction. It is common, even among outstanding memory scientists, to character-<br>
ize visual long-term memory as passive storage, and to characterize visual working <br>
memory as active storage.949 I believe that these characterizations are not helpful. Although <br><br>
