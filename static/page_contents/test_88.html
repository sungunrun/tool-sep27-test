relevant to the retinal image from cues specific to representation of a system-independent <br>
subject matter. There is a very direct match between the registrations produced in the <br>
computations and natural features in the retinal image. The connection to environmental <br>
contours is much less impressive. The registrations are isomorphic to lines in an approxi-<br>
mately flat 2-D plane; the contours in the environment are laid out, with orientations, in <br>
3-D space. So, not only the 3-dimensionality and orientation in 3-D space of the en vir on-<br>
men tal contours, but their shape and length—their most basic physical properties—are <br>
not matched, even approximately, by the registrations.<br>
<br>
To see this point vividly, imagine a registration that derives from a horizontal contour <br>
in the retinal image. The 2-D registration matches the shape, length, and orientation of the <br>
retinal-image contour. But the contour might have been produced by any of many con-<br>
tours of different shapes and lengths in the environment. For example, the retinal regis tra-<br>
tion matches an indefinite number of possible environmental contours of different lengths <br>
with sub-parts that bend forward or backward from the viewer, but in the same horizontal <br>
plane. Nothing in the computation distinguishes among these many possible <i>environment</i> <br>
contours. A perceptual state would represent exactly one contour type as occurring. The <br>
registration is not a perceptual state. The registrations provide a direct and close match to <br>
contours in the retinal image. They bear no good match to contours in the environment. <br>
In fact, each registration matches equally well members of a nearly infinite class of phys ic-<br>
al ly possible environmental contours, of different shapes, lengths, and orientations. The <br>
four operations can <i>never</i> distinguish, or be more relevant to, any one of these types. <br>
Usually, the environmental contour will <i>not</i> be flat in the frontal-parallel plane, as the <br>
retinal-image contour is. The science tries to explain causal patterns of representational <br>
connection between sensory states and the environment. There is no explanation of a con-<br>
nection to an environmental edge at this stage of visual processing.<br>
<br>
The best match is to projections of all members of the class onto the retinal image. The <br>
best account of the nature of the computed registrations is that they are invariances in the <br>
retinal image. The registrations are rightly treated differently from perceptual representa-<br>
tions, which are embedded in a perceptual constancy.<br>
<br>
It is true, as the reductionist claims, that, in the computational process, sensory states grow <br>
“closer” to environmental features. However, initial registrations bear no explanatory relation <br>
at all to any specific types of environmental contour. The law-like pattern that they instanti-<br>
ate is a pattern of relations purely to features of the retinal image. The image of just “getting <br>
closer” to environmental features in the computational process obscures this basic fact.<br>
<br>
These four stages of computation provide no close, illuminating connection to specific <br>
environmental features. They bear specific, scientifically illuminating connections to the <br>
retinal image. Later stages bear systematic, scientifically illuminating connections to spe-<br>
cific environmental features, including environmental contours. These later stages are the <br>
fruits of objectification. The products of computations become <i>perceptual</i> states. Earlier <br>
invariances concern only generic features of the retinal image. The invariances prepare for <br>
perceptual representation of the environment. The difference is a difference in what sci-<br>
ence explains at each stage, not just “degree of closeness”. By using a misleading metaphor, <br>
the reductionist obscures fundamental differences of kind.<br>
<br>
The spatial characteristics of the distal attributes are central to understanding the pre-<br>
sent case. Environmental contours are <i>essentially</i> contours in 3-D space. Their shape and <br>
length are their most basic features.</div>
