determining whether that target is a target for a perceived agent.619 So in early attribution <br>
of agency, infants attribute not only targets but sensory relations to targets.<br>
<br>
Agency is associated with bodily orientation in other ways. In ‘the wolfpack effect’, the <br>
presence of multiple objects orienting sides with eye-like features toward an object yields a <br>
sense that the object is in danger and the target of attack. This cue can distract from and <br>
override the cue of actual pursuit by an object perceived as dangerous. Fleeing an actual <br>
pursuer was interfered with by concern for eye-orientations by objects that had not shown <br>
themselves to be pursuing (in fact, they were moving randomly).620 Different species use <br>
different body-orientation cues in representing and responding to agency, according to <br>
what other animals are caretakers or threats.<br>
<br>
By age 6 months, human infants anticipate certain sorts of entities as likely agents of <br>
perceived bodily movements. For example, hands are closely associated with agency.621 In <br>
experiments in which a bean bag, previously shown to be inanimate, flies over a barrier, <br>
infants anticipate a hand behind the barrier, and are surprised by a toy. The hand had been <br>
previously associated with endogenously caused motion. Thus infants not only anticipate <br>
specific types and directions of agency from perception of specific agents. They also antici-<br>
pate specific types of agents from perception of specific types of movements. Bean bags do <br>
not fly over barriers on their own, or even normally via mechanical causation by non-<br>
agential entities.<br>
<br>
So representation of mechanical causation and agency representation interact. <br>
Anticipation associated with mechanical causation is in play only if it is not replaced by <br>
anticipation associated with agents. If two objects are represented as inanimate, or as non-<br>
agents, there is surprise if an approached object moves away from an approaching object <br>
before contact. The movement violates expectations regarding mechanical launchings. If <br>
the approached object is represented as an endogenous mover, there is no surprise if it <br>
moves away before the approaching object reaches it.<br>
<br>
A further set of anticipations enters into the relational structure of primitive represen-<br>
tation of agency. Infants, by 6 months at latest, anticipate agential movements to be <i>effi-<br>
cient</i> with respect to targets. If infants represent an entity as a self-mover and as pursuing a <br>
target, they anticipate the pursuit’s taking a direct rather than circuitous path. A circuitous <br>
path produces surprise in the absence of an obstacle.622 Anticipations of efficiency become <br><br>

12 (2009), 142–149. With many other developmental psychologists, Luo and Johnson do not distinguish perceiv-<br>
ing from non-perceptual sensing. They assume that the infant attributes perception to agents in their ex peri-<br>
ments. I think that nothing more than attribution of possible lines of sensing or states of sensing is at issue. <br>
Sensing is not a distinctively mental capacity. It need not be conscious. It need not have veridicality conditions. <br>
This and many other experiments take primitive attributions to be of mental capacities, whereas the evidence <br>
supports no more than attribution to infants and animals of agential teleological capacities and non-perceptual <br>
sensory capacities (that engage in information registration). See Burge, ‘Do Infants and Non-Human Animals <br>
Attribute Mental States?’.<br>
