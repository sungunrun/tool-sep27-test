Noun-Phrase-Like Structure and Iconic Representation 297</div>
<br><br>
A primary theme of this chapter is that, like all representation, iconic representation gets its <br>
representational structure from the nature of the representational functions and competen-<br>
cies that underlie its use. In fact, representational structure marks aspects of  representational <br>
functions and competencies. Iconicity is an aspect of representational format. Format is an <br>
aspect of representational structure, which is an aspect of mode of presentation. Hence <br>
iconic representational format is an aspect of perceptual representational content.<br>
<br>
There is, however, a more generic, and in a sense more basic, aspect of representational <br>
structure that iconic perceptual representational structure shares structure with certain <br>
sub-structures in non-iconic language and in non-iconic thought. This shared representa-<br>
tional structure is the noun-phrase-like structure dominated by a contextual referential <br>
determiner, involving attribution and referential application, that I outlined in Chapter 6.<br>
<br>
To explain this point intuitively: Take as a given that realist pictures are iconic. I argue <br>
later in this chapter, on empirical grounds, that perceptual states share an abstract struc-<br>
ture and semantics with realist pictures that function to depict particulars in a scene. <br>
Depicting particulars involves picking them out. So pictures have a representational func-<br>
tion that is shared with perceptual referential applications. Some aspects of a picture also <br>
function to characterize attributes of the particulars. A red section of the picture functions <br>
to characterize the color of a nose. A shape pattern functions to characterize the shape of <br>
the nose. So pictures have a representational function that is shared with perceptual attrib-<br>
utives. Iconic format in pictures and perception also shares a generic picking-out function <br>
and attributional structure with certain structures in non-iconic language and in non-<br>
iconic thought—noun-phrase-like structures governed by a contextually applied deter-<br>
miner. Iconic format in pictures and perception is a special sub-case of this generic <br>
structure. It is a specific type of mode of presentation whose function and structure are <br>
shared with certain non-iconic representation. A picture, perceptual state, relevant noun <br>
phrase, or relevant nominal structure in thought is veridical if and only if every referential <br>
application picks out a particular and every attributive is veridical of particulars thus <br>
picked out to which the attributive is applied.<br>
<br>
The key intuitive idea underlying the notion of iconic representation is that it utilizes <br>
natural correspondences between units of representation and entities in the represented <br>
subject matter. Here is a somewhat fuller characterization of iconic representation. A rep-<br>
resentational content, or representation, R, is <i>iconic</i> by virtue of meeting the following <br>
three conditions:<br><br>
(1) There is a natural, systematic 1–1-into mapping from one or more structural <br>
<br>
 representational unit types, or representational constituent types, of R, or from a rep-<br>
<br>
ertoire that includes R, to corresponding types of entities in the subject matter that R <br>
<br>
functions to represent.298<br><br>

<b>FOOTNOTES</b><br>
<b>Cont FN</b>298 That the mapping is functional implies that it could fail to match structural elements in the domain. So <br>
there can be non-veridical and purely fictional iconic representational mappings. Fictional mappings are para-<br>
sitic on real mappings. Non-veridical mappings are parasitic on veridical ones.<br>
<br>
One can allow minor divergences from strict 1–1 mappings. Perhaps for convenience two representational <br>
elements could be mapped to a single represented item, as when two circles occur on a subway map for stops at <br>
the same station on different subway lines. I am not fully convinced by such examples. Usually, different circles <br>
represent different positions in the same station. When they do not, it is usually possible to regard the two differ-<br>
ent circles as the same representational element, repeated for convenience—or as occupying different maps (one <br>
for each subway line). I owe the example to Ned Block. Although I do not insist on strict 1–1 mappings, I take <br>
them to be paradigmatic.</div>
