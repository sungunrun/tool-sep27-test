196  Form and Semantics of Perceptual Contents</div>
<br><br>
Lack of subscripts in ‘that x’ and ‘that y’ indicates that the schemas are not applied. That x <br>
(without subscript) is a schematic determiner that would need a perceptual referential appli-<br>
cation to function to refer to an impala-body. That y (without subscript) would need a refer-<br>
ential application to refer to an instance of <i>impala-shape</i>. The visual anticipation is veridical <br>
if and only if there are future perceptual referential applications to particulars that have the <br>
relevant attributes, where the particulars are at the anticipated place at the anticipated time.<br>
<br>
The anticipation content is accurate <i>of</i> some individuals and not of others. It is not <br>
accurate or inaccurate in itself. It <i>comes to be</i> accurate if and only if<br><br>
there come to be, at a specific place, at n temporal units after t, referential applica-<br>
<br>
tions of that x and that y that refer, respectively, to a perceived impala-body and an <br>
<br>
impala-shape-instance; those applications are appropriately causally connected to <br>
<br>
the anticipatory state, and the impala-body is impala-shaped—indeed, has the <br>
<br>
instance of impala-shape that is perceived.<br><br>
Such referential applications would <i>change</i> the schematic form into a perceptual represen-<br>
tational content capable of being accurate. Unlike a quantified representational content, <br>
the schema itself—the perceptual anticipation itself—is neither accurate nor inaccurate.<br>
<br>
A similar analysis applies to one’s anticipation of the shapes of unseen sides of a body seen <br>
as 3-D. One’s perception attributes and perceptually refers to a 3-D shape. It does so by per-<br>
ceptually representing facing surfaces. One perceptually refers to—picks out by referential <br>
applications—the whole body, the whole shape, and the facing surfaces. The system does not <br>
referentially pick out the unseen sides or their specific shapes. Such shapes and sides are <br>
attributed as a consequence of attributing the 3-D volume shape. They are not seen or demon-<br>
stratively referred to, since no aspect of the perceptual state is in a relevant causal relation to <br>
them. The system can, however, form states that schematically anticipate, commonly less <br>
determinately, what would be seen if the body were turned, or if the perceiver moved around <br>
the body. These states have the same form as the lion’s schematic anticipation of the impala.<br>
<br>
This account assumes that the anticipation is not formed from a memory of a specific <br>
impala that the lion anticipates will appear at a given location. In such a case, no temptation <br>
to think that there may be a quantifier in the representational content could get started.<br>
<br>
The schematic forms just discussed bear comparison to substitutional quantification.196 <br>
Substitutional quantification is usually given a semantics for sentences. This type of quan-<br>
tification takes a formula ‘(∃x)Fx’ to be true if and only if there is some expression in the <br>
language that is grammatically substitutable for free variable ‘x’ in ‘Fx’ and that is assigned <br>
some entity from the domain or subject matter.<br>
<br>
Schematic representation is not substitutional quantification. The latter involves a fixed <br>
set of expressions that are grammatically allowed substituends for the quantified variable, <br>
and that have an assignment of some semantical value from a subject matter. Referential <br>
applications are not available for such substitution at the times when generic, schematic <br><br>
