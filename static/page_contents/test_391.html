<b>Two Lines of Empirical Criticism of Treisman’s Theory<br><br>
</div>
</b>I have discussed problems and revisions <i>internal</i> to Treisman’s theory. I now discuss work <br>
that raised more basic difficulties for Treisman’s view of initial visual perception. There are <br>
two lines of development—one, more theory-based; the other, more experimentally based.<br>
<br>
The theory-based development showed that many effects that Treisman took to result <br>
from attention in visual search—for example, search times—could be accounted for by <br>
appeal to low-level visual properties. For example, noise, differences between the retina’s <br>
center and its periphery, and differences in the sizes of receptive fields and in the density <br>
of retinal cells were shown to account for much of the search-time data without appeal to <br>
attention.444<br>
<br>
I focus more on the more experimentally based work. I first lay out important upshots <br>
of the experiments, then discuss them in more detail. These experiments carry us toward a <br>
view of first-formed perception that currently seems approximately accurate.<br>
<br>
Two lines of work centered on visual perception that results from very short stimulus <br>
exposure. Both lines aimed to understand what sort of visual representations are achieved <br>
in the short time periods between saccades. Recall that saccades are eye-shifts that occur <br>
in humans roughly 3 times per second. Most work used stimulus exposures between 18 <br>
and 107 ms. There is substantial evidence, discussed mostly in Chapter 11, that relevant <br>
perceptual states are formed well within the time that occurs between saccades, even <br>
within 100 ms from stimulus onset.<br>
<br>
The main results of this work are as follows.<br>
<br>
First, binding of multiple attributes can be localized and represented “bound”—as <br>
aspects of a single particular—without attention.<br>
<br>
Although attention is probably <i>present</i> in some sub-part of any perceptual representa-<br>
tion, conscious or not, it does not follow that attention is <i>necessary</i> for forming any specific <br>
perceptual referential application or perceptual attribution. There is cross-attribute attri-<br>
bution of properties to particulars, hence binding, even when the representations are <br>
backed by as little attention as current experimental methods can find. So binding of prop-<br>
erties to a single particular located in environmental space occurs, despite no evidence <br>
that attention figures in the binding.<br>
<br>
As explained in the preliminary points in this chapter, there are no experimental <br>
 methods or agreed-upon theoretical models that show that attention is <i>fully</i> absent in any <br>
given part of the visual field. There are, however, experimental methods—presenting the <br>
perceiver with various distracting tasks that place heavy demands on attention—that show <br>
that, for some aspects of a perception (those not involved in the demanding task), there is <br>
little or no attention. Again, as far as current experimental methods have shown, <br><br>
