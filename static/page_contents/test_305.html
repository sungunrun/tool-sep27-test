Iconic Aspects of Perceptual Spatial Representation 305</div>
<br><br>
The intuitive point is elaborated in perceptual theory. The abstract topology of percep-<br>
tual representational content has derivative mathematical association with literal topolo-<br>
gies in the brain, and thence to spatial positions of areas of surfaces in the environment. <br>
For example, neural activity in the cortical area that connects to retinal receptors that <br>
receive light from the upper right corner of the retinal image correlates with aspects of <br>
conscious perception that represent the upper right corner of the visual perception of <br>
space (and represents entities in the upper right corner of the spatial layout of the scene). <br>
Even if consciousness and perceptual content are not literally laid out in space, there is a <br>
geometrical or topological structure-preserving mapping between aspects of space and <br>
aspects of conscious visual representation of space.<br>
<br>
The iconic nature of visual spatial <i>representation</i> and <i>representational content</i> is <br>
grounded in the iconic nature of visual <i>sensory information registration</i> and in the spatial <br>
layout of aspects of the central brain that correspond to space-mapping areas in visual <br>
perception.<br>
<br>
Four factors—visual representational content, visual non-representational information <br>
registration, cortical central brain areas that underlie spatial perception, and visual recep-<br>
tors—figure in the discussion. All ground either iconic information registration or iconic <br>
spatial representation. All are structurally related. The physical layout of the visual recep-<br>
tors renders the registration of information from the retinal image iconic. The iconic <br>
regis tra tion of the retinal image has mappings into the central brain. These registrational <br>
mappings are also iconic. Both mappings help make visual representation in perceptual <br>
states (and their representational contents) iconic. The mapping of geometric or topo-<br>
logic al structures common to physical space, visual receptors, visual information registra-<br>
tion by banks of retinal and cortical neurons, and the format of visual representational <br>
content lies at the base of the iconic nature of visual spatial perception.<br>
<br>
I start with the spatial structure of sensory receptors (at least in vision and touch). Such <br>
receptors form a 2-D array in physical space. In vision, each receptor is associated with a <br>
certain spatial part of the retinal image—the 2-D array of light that constitutes the prox-<br>
imal stimulus.307<br>
<br>
This 2-D layout is preserved in neural layouts in the cortex, layouts specialized for <br>
vision. Areas of the primary visual cortex (V1) and other brain areas associated with early <br>
stages of visual processing are specialized to respond to corresponding areas of the retinal <br>
receptors and retinal image (the proximal stimulus).308 Thus, the <i>sensory information <br>
regis tra tion</i> of proximal stimuli in the early stages of vision has a literal spatial arrange-<br>
ment that corresponds, in vision, to the spatial arrangement of the retinal image. The spa-<br>
tial information registered by the sensors and by the further registrational states in the <br>
cortex that derive from them is laid out in spatial matrixes. The matrixes bear literal, sys-<br>
tematic relations to positions in the retinal image—the area of light hitting the retinae. <br>
These non-perceptual registrations are unquestionably iconic.<br><br>
