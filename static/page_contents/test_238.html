238 Attributives, Referential Applications in Constancies</div>
<br><br>
In this respect, perceptual attributives contrast with many concepts in thought and with <br>
linguistic meanings. The concepts mercury and element with atomic number 80 indicate <br>
the same kind. Each concept figures in attributing the kind when it substitutes for the <br>
other in the schema that is some—–. Understanding the concepts does not guarantee <br>
understanding that they apply to the same kind. The sameness of their <i>representatum</i> is <br>
not necessarily marked in a psychology that has both concepts. They are linked only if one <br>
contingently believes an identity proposition that links the concepts. (I think that an indi-<br>
vidual who has concepts mercury and quicksilver may also not link the concepts as shar-<br>
ing a <i>representatum</i>.) The types of understanding marked by having the respective <br>
concepts do not guarantee that, in understanding the different concepts well enough to <br>
use them, one understands them to represent the same kind—or even associates them <br>
psychologically in any special way. One must add to one’s competence with the concepts a <br>
belief that mercury is the element with atomic number 80. Similarly, for that ball is red and <br>
that ball is colored in a way most commonly associated with passion. The fact that the <br>
attributives attribute the same attribute is not accessible to understanding just by under-<br>
standing them well enough to use them.<br>
<br>
By contrast, in a perceptual constancy, having any of the attributives for a given length <br>
guarantees that the perceptual system can apply all the attributives to the same length. For <br>
perceptual attributives, the sameness of <i>representatum</i> is built into the perceptual compe-<br>
tence and the representational content. The competence is associated with present psycho-<br>
logical capacities, such as actional dispositions, to use any of the linked perceptual <br>
attributives to treat the common indicant as that indicant.<br>
<br>
There are pairs of <i>linguistic</i> and <i>conceptual</i> attributives that attribute the same attribute <br>
and do so in a way that <i>is</i> entailed by their meanings or representational contents. An <br>
example is the pair (a) red and (b) red or both green all over and not green all over. Here <br>
the entailment is guaranteed by logical form. Of course, mathematically equivalent at tribu tives <br>
indicate, as wholes, the same mathematical entities. Their doing so follows by mathematics <br>
from their representational contents. For example, the attributives (a) divided by 2; (b) <br>
divided by the positive square root of 4; and (c) divided by the cube root of 8 indicate the <br>
same function and do so as a mathematical consequence of their representational con-<br>
tents. However, the logical/mathematical equivalences need not cor res pond to present <br>
dispositions to treat indicants equivalently.<br>
<br>
The pairings of linked perceptual attributives are empirically informative in ways that <br>
the pairings of logically and mathematically equivalent concepts are not. Moreover, the <br>
sameness does not have to be determined by some operation. It is built into perceptual <br>
competence and use. The connections among linked perceptual attributives are deter-<br>
mined not through logical or mathematical connections, but through a perceptual sys-<br>
tem’s having been exposed to law-like or statistically significant physical patterns <i>in its <br>
formation</i>. Though often innate, connections among linked perceptual attributives that <br>
mark these broad physical patterns are empirically informative. They correspond to, track, <br>
and carry information about environmental patterns.<br>
<br>
For example, the linkage between two perceptual attributives for a given length derives <br>
from the way edges reflect light (including the fact that light travels in straight lines and, in <br>
normal conditions, is not distorted) onto the retina from different orientations with <br>
respect to a perceiver, and from the fact that edges tend to remain rigid over spatial <br>
transformations.</div>
