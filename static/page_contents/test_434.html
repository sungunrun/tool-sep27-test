434 Primitive Attribution of Causation, Agency</div>
<br><br>
attributive can be explained naturally, simply, and computationally, appealing to capacities <br>
that are known to be similar to perceptual capacities already known. There is no general <br>
criterion.<br>
<br>
In vision, computations of surface shapes in the retinal image, textures, visible surfaces, <br>
and relatively simple spatial relations are known not to be formed later than representa-<br>
tions of 3-D volume shapes and bodies. Causal-computational processes that lead to the <br>
formation of 3-D volume-shape perceptual attributives always compute the visible sur-<br>
faces of such volume shapes and normally set them in spatial relations to one another. <br>
Sometimes body attributives may be temporarily formed directly from attributives for <br>
surfaces. Acceptance, in recent decades, of perceptual attributives for <i>body</i> and <i>body-part</i> <br>
rested on the relative simplicity of extending computational explanation for formation of <br>
surfaces and 3-D volume-shape attributives to explanation of formation of body attribu-<br>
tives, on some evidence about the neural grounding of body attribution, and on the fact <br>
that body attributives could be understood as grounded in simple perceptual anticipations <br>
of continuation of certain (generic) 3-D volume-shape attributions.<br>
<br>
The lay-person bias that I mentioned is toward freely augmenting the range of percep-<br>
tual attributives, without regard to the detailed empirical work of scientific theory.<br>
<br>
Some of this bias stems from ordinary language. We use ‘seeing as’ and ‘seeing that’ very <br>
freely. Ordinary language cannot be expected to limn natural kinds in psychological sys-<br>
tems. We say that an x-ray technician sees a body <i>as</i> an x-ray machine. We say that the <br>
technician sees <i>that</i> the body is an x-ray machine. These phrases give us no more than that <br>
the x-ray technician can determine something to be an x-ray machine quickly, by looking. <br>
They do not imply that there is a perceptual attributive, x-ray machine or that the techni-<br>
cian does not specify the body as an x-ray machine only in empirical beliefs.<br>
<br>
Some bias in philosophy derives from over-intellectualization of perception and per-<br>
ceptual belief. The main source of over-intellectualization has been bad theory about ref-<br>
erence and attribution. I discuss such theories elsewhere and just mention them here.549<br>
<br>
Some bias derives from inferring what is perceptual from phenomenal introspection. <br>
Such approaches give explanations via armchair methods. Phenomenal introspection is <br>
not a good stand-alone basis for such explanations. Since many differences among state-<br>
types are not phenomenal or introspectable (such as formation speed), judgments about <br>
phenomenal differences are not a privileged, or even very good, source of evidence.<br>
<br>
The main difficulties with such empiricist approaches through introspection are that <br>
they do not make serious use of what is known about how perceptual systems work, and <br>
do not consider sources of evidence that are inaccessible to introspection. Most of the <br>
empirical considerations that are directly relevant to settling whether a representation is a <br>
perception are never discussed.550 Apart from serious reflection on science, it is impossible <br><br>

550 An example of this approach is S. Siegel, <i>The Contents of Visual Experience</i> (Oxford: Oxford University <br>
Press, 2010). There are scattered references to empirical work, notably several in <i>social psychology</i> on perception <br>
(for example, Siegel, 11n). Approaches to vision in social psychology are mostly weak science, crippled by meth-<br>
odological errors that have been exposed by perceptual psychology. (See Chapter 19, the section The <br>
Cognitive Penetration Controversy.) The main arguments in the Siegel book for regarding various <br>
attributives as perceptual do not come to grips with any mainstream empirical work at all. The evidence for <br>
the views presented mainly comes from phenomenal introspection. This is an impossibly narrow, and in <br>
several respects misleading, evidential base for understanding perception. One could claim that the work is <br>
to be understood as trying to explain phenomenal differences or conscious experience. One could claim that <br>
the work does not seek to understand the natural kind <i>perception</i>, as studied in science.  (<i>cont</i>.) </div>
