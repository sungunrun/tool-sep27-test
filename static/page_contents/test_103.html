<i>will</i> be reliably correlated (and explained by) the objective complete duration of the <br>
<br>
reigning of the alarm bell. In ordinary circumstances, there is no highly variable range of <br>
<br>
environmental features of such a kind that a wide range of different such features will <br>
<br>
produce the same extended event of pressure on the eardrum. The correlation, in normal <br>
<br>
circumstances, between the objective duration of the bell ringing and the duration of the <br>
<br>
stimulation of the eardrum is uniform. (See note 107.)<br><br>
Nothing in the case description shows that hearing the bell is perceptual. “Reliable cor-<br>
rel ation” does not suffice for perception. All non-perceptual sensing involves correlations <br>
between proximal stimulation and objective phenomena. All are <i>functionally</i> explained <br>
by correlation with objective circumstances. Nothing in this case shows whether the for-<br>
mation of the sensing is to be <i>causally</i> explained in terms of states that represent an <br>
objective condition—a sound in the environment—as opposed to non-perceptually <br>
re gis ter ing the proximal stimuli—the sound waves as they strike the ear. Some aspects of <br>
hearing are perceptual. The clearest cases in perceptual hearing are those in which tem-<br>
poral attributions are harnessed to spatial aspects of hearing. Then the temporal aspects <br>
do not follow from a simple correlation of proximal and distal timing. These are probably <br>
not the only cases of perceptual hearing. I think it insufficiently explored what aspects of <br>
hearing are perceptual and what ones are non-perceptual, but sensory-information-<br>
registrational. I do claim that correlation between duration of a proximal stimulus and <br>
duration of a sensed distal condition does not suffice to make an instance of auditory <br>
sensing <i>perceptual</i>. A creature lacking perceptual capacities could respond functionally to <br>
distal events of certain durations because proximal stimuli from those events lasts for <br>
corresponding durations.<br>
<br>
Peacocke’s second example comes from vision. He thinks that the same one–one cor rel-<br>
ation between (a) visual perception of the duration of motion, (b) duration of proximal <br>
stimuli coming from the motion, and (c) duration of perceived objective motion, holds in <br>
some visual motion perception. He thinks that accurate perception of duration of motion <br>
(what I think is at best a loose way of describing perception of motion as being of certain <br>
durations) is confined to very circumscribed cases. He cites the fact that the perceived <br>
duration between two events can increase with objective distance between those events <br>
[the “Kappa effect”], even when the corresponding retinal separation of those events is the <br>
same. In interpreting this phenomenon, he cites only an article that is over 65 years old. <br>
He writes:<br><br>
The Kappa effect is also not something that at all fits a model of constancy in which vary-<br>
<br>
ing proximal stimulation is consistent with generally correct objective representation. On <br>
<br>
the contrary, the dilation effect of perceiving durations between distant events as longer <br>
<br>
means that some perceptions of durations between spatially separated events must be <br>
<br>
non-veridical rather than correct.109<br><br>
Both premise and reasoning are mistaken. The reasoning is mistaken because all per-<br>
ceptual constancies have limits to their applications. The fact that some perceptions in <br><br>
