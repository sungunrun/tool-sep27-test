Review of Basic Form of Perceptual Representation 157</div>
<br><br>
renderings of representational contents, subscripts on variables mark occurrence-based <br>
referential applications. Referential applications are <i>exercises</i> of the competence that con-<br>
stitutes the second representational element. The second element is the schematic form <br>
that is a standing, context-dependent, ability-general competence to exercise referential <br>
applications—to pick out particulars. The competence resides in a psychology even when <br>
it is not exercised. For semantical reasons stated in Chapter 2 and elaborated as we pro-<br>
ceed, the standing competence must be marked in the representational content of percep-<br>
tual states that are caused by occurrent stimuli.171 In our symbolism for representational <br>
contents, this competence is marked either by a demonstrative-like schema, like that, or by <br>
an indexical-like schema, like ego-here or ego-now. A subscript on a variable marks an <br>
occurrence, or an exercise, of a referential competence, that in perception is caused by a <br>
stimulus. The exercise enables the schematic context-dependent competence to refer, in <br>
something like the way an occurrent use enables a previously unused demonstrative ‘that’ <br>
or an unused indexical ‘here’ to refer. Perceptual attributives constitute the third structural <br>
element. These are competencies to characterize particulars that are referentially picked <br>
out. Their function is to indicate an attribute and, when applied, to characterize  perceived—<br>
picked out—entities. Characterization is attribution. Attribution in perception constitu-<br>
tively requires referential application. So there are two general competencies— reference <br>
and attribution—and one event-like exercise of the referential competence. In perception, <br>
the event-like exercise of the referential competence is constitutively also a simultaneous <br>
exercise of the attributional competence.<br>
<br>
The fundamental, simplified structure made up of these three structural elements is<br><br>
(that x1)F(x1).<br><br>
‘F’ stands in for a perceptual attributive. ‘(that x1)’ stands in for an exercise (marked <br>
by the subscript) of the singular referential competence, which is simultaneously an <br>
application of the attributive F (binding the variable ‘x1’). The form is that of a <br>
perceptual-state-instance.<br>
<br>
The structure is nominal—that of a noun phrase governed by a contextually referential <br>
determiner. In perceptual states, widest scope is always occupied by one or more referen-<br>
tial applications. In the displayed formula, the referential application (that x1) scope-<br>
dominates the attributive F. The structure is nominal because a perceptual state’s primary <br>
function is to pick out particulars in a way that perceptually characterizes them. <br>
Characterizing them is a necessary auxiliary to the primary point—picking them out. <br>

Constituents in Perceptual States; Chapter 5, the section Support <br>

<br>
The representational function of a perceptual referential application is to pick out a par-<br>
ticular. The representational function of a perceptual attributive is to accurately character-<br>
ize picked-out particulars. Both characterization and picking out occur only through the <br><br>
