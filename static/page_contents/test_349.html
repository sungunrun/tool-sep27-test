Differences in scope, of the sort discussed in section Chapter 6, the section Scope <br>
Hierarchies in Perceptual Content, are, of course, available. The forms just <br>
cited illustrate the fundamental representational form of all perceptual states. Such forms <br>
clearly have canonical decomposition.<br>
<br>
The illustrative linear linguistic forms of representation suggest huge <i>lines</i> of unordered <br>
demonstrative-like applications at the front of every noun-phrase-like structure. One can <br>
specify the accuracy condition of any perceptual state in such a form. The linear linguistic <br>
format of this articulation of perceptual representation is, of course, potentially misleading. <br>
The iconic format of perceptual representation is an aspect of its formal structure or “syn-<br>
tax”. Although I think that having iconic format is plausibly constitutive of all natural per-<br>
ception (this chapter, the section Iconic Perception, Iconic Concepts, Iconic <br>
Representation in Propositional Thought), <i>spatial</i> iconic format is not con-<br>
stitutive of perception, even visual perception. As noted earlier, I think it possible for there <br>
to be perceptions of color, in primitive animals or in abnormal higher-level  perceivers, <br>
that are not associated with spatial representation (Chapter 8, the section Is Temporal <br>
Representation Constitutive to Perceptual Representation?).<br>
<br>
The spatial mapping structure in ordinary human perception can be shifted, even dis-<br>
torted, through adaptation or attention. Specific spatial and temporal framework map-<br>
pings alter in predictable ways from context to context, especially with shifts of attention. <br>
Such alterations are disanalogous to the relative stability of linguistic grammars, much less <br>
logical forms. (See Chapter 15, the section Attention and Accuracy; Chapter 16, <br>
the section Trans-Saccadic Memory.) So spatial structures, though central to most <br>
mammalian perception, should not be thought of as necessarily present—or when pre-<br>
sent, not constantly altered—as linguistic grammars are usually taken to be.<br>
<br>
In sum, the abstract, not-specifically-iconic form of the first examples in this section is <br>
constitutive of all perception, and never altered. I think that, constitutively, all natural per-<br>
ception has iconic format. The specific type of iconic mapping structures vary with differ-<br>
ent perceptual systems. Even within given systems, the form of an iconic mapping varies <br>
with attention.<br>
<br>
Nevertheless, the map-like, part–whole inducing format of visual and tactile perceptual <br>
representation is a deep, common structure. As with the semantics of iconic part–whole <br>
structure (this chapter, the section Part–Whole Representation in Pictures <br>
and Visual Perception), spelling out structural relationships among representa-<br>
tions that meet conditions of normal iconic systematic natural mappings would be a mas-<br>
sive task. Still, the basics of such principles are not, I think, intuitively problematic. One <br>
has a start toward understanding spatial structure by considering part–whole constraints <br>
implicit in the iconography of pictures or maps. One must always be ready to qualify the <br>
picture/map analogy. Vision and touch are vastly more complex than depiction.<br>
<br>
I gave an example of such a “grammatical”, structural relation in the previous section:<br><br>
If two parts or aspects, <i>S</i>1 and <i>S</i>2, of a perceptual representation each functions to represent <br>
a natural unit surface <i>S</i>, and <i>S</i>1 is in the analog of the to-the-left-of-relation to <i>S</i>2 in the <br>
representational format, then <i>S</i>1 functions to represent a surface-part that is to the left of <br>
the surface-part that <i>S</i>2 represents.<br><br>
Such structural principles are not stateable independently of reference to semantic function.Compositionality in Iconic Perceptual Representation 349</div>
