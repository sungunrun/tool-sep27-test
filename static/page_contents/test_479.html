Attribution of Further Structural Elements of Agency 479</div>

motions (the motion paths) in egocentrically anchored spatial and temporal frameworks. <br>
I take readings of ‘human-shaped’, ‘human-body’ ‘pig-shape’, ‘pig-body’, ‘movement’, <br>
‘agent’, and ‘act’ to be obvious. ‘Chasing’ and ‘fleeing’ represent types of action—types that I <br>
think visual capacities could attribute. ‘Target-object(x3, x2)’ indicates the relation of being <br>
target-object or theme of the act. Other thematic roles, such as <i>instrument</i> or <i>beneficiary</i>, <br>
could be attributed in other types of action.<br>
<br>
Infants and apes’ representation of agency goes beyond representing structural elem-<br>
ents. It involves computing anticipations of motion paths, anticipations of timing of a <br>
future act, and memories of the foregoing. Some of these anticipations and memories are <br>
likely to be perceptual.<br>
<br>
Whether or not agency is perceptually represented, psychologists and lay people tend to <br>
underestimate how much of the responses to agency by infants, adults, and non-human <br>
animals are best explained in terms of perception, perceptually guided conation, percep-<br>
tual memory, and perceptual anticipation. Underestimation derives from over-<br>
intellectualization of earliest agency-attributions. I highlight some distinctions that may <br>
help avoid hyper-intellectualization.643<br>
<br>
First, it is one thing to represent an agent as acting with a target. It is another to repre-<br>
sent an agent as acting as a result of the <i>agent’s</i> representing that target—representing it <i>as</i> <br>
an action target. A snail’s action of crawling up a plant can have the target of eating a leaf, <br>
without the snail’s representing the target—or anything at all. The snail’s action is a result <br>
of conative states and is guided by non-representational, non-perceptual sensing. The <br>
snail’s actions do not issue from a representational psychology. The snail almost surely <br>
lacks any perceptual constancies, or indeed any representational states. It lacks representa-<br>
tional states with veridicality conditions as an aspect of the states’ natures. It acts simply in <br>
sensory response to proximal stimuli according to relatively instinctual conative sets or <br>
drives. These states function to co-vary with and cause the act. They function to enable the <br>
snail to reach its target. Its crawling is certainly action.<br>
<br>
A snail does not represent its target. We do. Generic representation of action is not rep-<br>
resentation of intentional action, or action whose target is otherwise represented by <br>
the agent.<br>
<br>
Some correct explanations of agency do not refer to psychological or representational <br>
states. A snail’s acts are explained computationally and functionally. The snail’s states cause <br>
actions. They function to cause the actions. They do not exhibit perceptual constancies, <br>
that would invite attributing to the snail representational competencies. Earliest represen-<br>
tation of action by humans and other animals, whether the representation is perceptual or <br>
supra-perceptual, almost surely does not represent the action as representationally guided. <br>
Of course, earliest attribution of action also does not deny that the action is representa-<br>
tionally guided. It is generic representation that is silent about mentality. Perceptual sys-<br>
tems do not attribute representational states. If action is attributed perceptually, the <br>
attribution is generic.<br>
<br>
A corollary is that perception-guided action is to be distinguished from action guided <br>
by generic sensing. All agent organisms can sense the world. Not all perceptually represent <br>
it. A snail’s sensing guides it to the leaf. No science attributes, in causal explanations, <br><br>
