of a property or relation, in a specific way that hinges on a specific stimulus and perspec-<br>
tive on the particular, property, or relation, lies at the heart of perception. The psy cho-<br>
logic al ly specific way is the way of characterizing the entities that are purportedly referred <br>
to in a perceptual state. That way is integral to perceptual constancies.<br>
<br>
The modern notion of representational content is an heir of Frege’s notion of sense. <br>
As will become evident in discussion of representational content, my notion drops Frege’s <br>
Platonic ontology of sense, and grounds representational contents in psychologies. In fact, <br>
I take representational contents to <i>be</i> psychological kinds of representational states, events, <br>
or competencies. Representational contents can include psychological events in time <br>
(what I call <i>context-bound referential applications</i>). This idea, too, departs from Frege’s <br>
notion of sense, which was context-free. However, representational contents retain key <br>
functions that Frege assigned to sense. Both sense and representational content set, or <br>
contribute to setting, veridicality conditions, and constitute ways in which <i>representata</i> are <br>
presented to minds.14<br>
<br>
A fourth Fregean idea is a corollary of the first three. Since Frege took senses to be or <br>
contribute to thought contents, he took them to have logical form.15 He took thoughts’ <br>
logical forms to be structures that ground systematic semantic explanation of truth and <br>
falsity in terms of denotation and predication. Analogs of logical forms also underlie <br>
propositional inference—for him, specifically deductive inference.<br>
<br>
Frege’s notion of logical form has an analog and root in perception. The simplest logical <br>
forms involve reference and predication. Reference occurs in perception: perception of <br>
something is a kind of reference to it. Predication is a sub-species of attribution. <br>
Attribution occurs in perception: perceiving something as being a certain way involves <br>
attribution of a property, kind, or relation. Perception attributes properties, kinds, or rela-<br>
tions in perceptually characterizing what is perceived—what perception referentially picks <br>
out. Combination of aspects of perception that function to refer with aspects that function <br>
to attribute yield complexes that are either accurate or inaccurate. These complexes are <br>
analogs of thoughts or sentences that have logical form. The complexes are literally repre-<br>
sentational structures of perceptual states. The combinations of reference and attribution <br>
can be evaluated for perceptual accuracy or inaccuracy. Logical form is a structure for <br>
propositional thoughts and sentences. Logical forms go well beyond anything present in <br>
perception. Perception contains no logical connectives (or, if–then), no quantifiers (all), <br>
and no modal operators or modal attributives (is necessary). I argue these points in <br>
Chapter 6, the section ABSence In PercePtIon oF NegatIonS, CondItIonalS, <br>
DISjunctIonS, and QuantIFIerS. They are intuitively plausible enough to be stated <br>
here. Perception exercises reference and attribution. Reference and attribution are psycho-<br>
logical, representational capacities. Understanding ways in which these semantical factors <br>
combine to yield semantically structured perceptual states, which are accurate or in accur-<br>
ate, is part of understanding perception.<br><br>

15 Strictly, for Frege, the notion of denotation (<i>Bedeutung)</i> applied to a relation between symbols and <i>represen-<br>
tata</i>, not a relation between senses and <i>representata</i>. His term for the latter relation was ‘determination’ <br>
(<i>Bestimmung</i>). Determination is structurally analogous to denotation. In fact, Frege thought of determination <br>
as more basic than denotation, because he thought that the contents of thoughts (senses) are more basic than <br>
linguistic expression of them.</div>
