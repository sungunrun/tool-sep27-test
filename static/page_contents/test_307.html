Until the last 30 years, it was widely thought that visual field maps were located entirely <br>
in early visual areas. This view depended partly on inadequate technology for testing the <br>
later visual areas, for example, from V4 onward. It also depended on reasoning by psych-<br>
olo gists that since the higher areas supported spatial constancies, visual representation was <br>
“position invariant”. So, went the reasoning, one should not expect field maps in those areas.<br>
<br>
The view also probably depended on not taking into account discoveries in the late <br>
1970s of neural maps in the barn owl that correlate with spatial positions in <i>distal</i> en vir on-<br>
men tal space, and that also correlate with the owl’s spatial perceptual competencies.312<br>
<br>
Better technology found many maps in the higher visual areas in humans. Many of <br>
these maps play a role in mapping the environmental positions of perceptually represented <br>
entities, as contrasted with maps that merely register positions in the retinal image.313<br>
<br>
The reasoning by psychologists, cited four paragraphs back, was unsound. A given area <br>
of a brain map can be active in response to a position in distal environmental space, or can <br>
otherwise aid in representation of a position in space. It can support a representation of <br>
something in that position via an egocentrically (or even allocentrically) anchored map. <br>
The discovery of maps that figure in <i>perceptually</i> mapping the distal environment is per-<br>
haps most important development in neuro-science’s visual-field mapping in the last 30 or <br>
so years.314<br>
<br>
Sensitivity to <i>retinal</i> position is not lost among maps that figure in representing spatial <br>
structures in the distal environment. That is, even where a map figures in representing the <br>
distal position of a perceived entity, there is evidence that retinal position of the effect of <br>
the perceived entity is kept track of, either in that map or in some other map with which <br>
that map coordinates.315<br><br>
