2. This specific function of perceptual states functions to contribute to fulfilling the <br>
overall representational function that perceptual states share with other committal repre-<br>
sentational states—the function of being veridical. (Premise)<br>
<br>
3. A representational state’s being veridical is fulfilling the condition for veridicality <br>
that the state sets. (Premise)<br>
<br>
4. So a perceptual state’s fulfilling the specific representational function of picking out <br>
or referring to particulars contributes to fulfilling the overall representational function of <br>
perceptual states—fulfilling the condition for veridicality that the perceptual state sets. <br>
(From 1., 2., and 3.)<br>
<br>
5. Every occurrent perceptual state’s fulfilling its specific representational function of <br>
perceptually picking out, referring to, a particular in response to present stimuli depends <br>
partly on the stimuli being part of an <i>occurrent causal relation</i> between the picked-out, <br>
referred-to, particular and the perceptual state occurrence.143 (Premise)<br>
<br>
6. The occurrent aspect of an occurrent perceptual state that functions to pick out, <br>
refer to, a particular, partly via an occurrent causal relation to the particular, is a <i>referential <br>
application</i>.144 (By 5. and definition of ‘referential application’.)<br>
<br>
7. For any occurrent perceptual state to have the specific representational function of <br>
perceptually picking out (referring to) a particular in response to present stimuli via an <br>
occurrent causal relation to the picked out (referred-to) particular, the perceptual state <br>
must be part of a perceptual <i>competence</i> to fulfill the function.145 (Premise)<br>
<br>
8. Similarly, for any occurrent perceptual state to have the overall representational <br>
function of being veridical, the perceptual state must be part of a perceptual competence <br>
to fulfill this function by being veridical. (Premise)<br>
<br>
9. So every occurrent perceptual state has an occurrent aspect that functions to pick <br>
out (refer to) a particular, at least partly by being an effect of an occurrent causal sequence <br>
into which the particular enters. Every occurrent perceptual state instantiates a perceptual-<br>
state-<i>type</i> that is part of a perceptual competence to pick out (refer to) particulars in this <br>
way. (From 5., 6., and 7.)<br>
<br>
10. Every occurrent perceptual state instantiates a <i>repeatable</i> competence. A repeatable <br>
competence is a competence to respond the same way again given the same input and <br>
given the same psychological background conditions. A repeatable <i>representational</i> com-<br>
petence is a competence to respond representationally in the same way to a repeatable <br>
type. That is, the same type of representational competence could have been exercised on <br>
another occasion in responding representationally to different instances of the same type <br>
of cause.146 (Premise)<br><br>

<b>FOOTNOTES</b><br>
<b>Cont FN</b>143 The premise states the causal principle for perceptual reference. One perceives, that is, perceptually refers <br>
to, only entities that occurrently cause the occurrence of the perceptual state, indeed a particular aspect of the <br>
perceptual state.<br>
<br>
144 This step is virtually definitional of what a perceptual referential application is, using step 5. to ground <br>
assumption of the presence of referential applications in perceptual states. Clearly, referential applications function <br>
representationally in perception as do context-bound, occurrently used demonstratives function in language. Of <br>
course, demonstratives are commonly referentially applied in linguistic acts. Perceptual referential applications are <br>
simply occurrent events or occurrent aspects of occurrent perceptual states. They are usually not actions.<br>
<br>
145 Quite generally, a psychological function implies a corresponding competence to fulfill it. A competence <br>
can be damaged or interfered with. Of course, as remarked in Chapter 3, even an undamaged, un-interfered-with <br>
competence has no apriori-set level of success in fulfilling its function. It is a capacity to fulfill the function—<br>
commonly associated with some successes.<br>
<br>
146 All competencies are repeatable. The premise simply articulates the point, and indicates that a <i>representa-<br>
tional</i> repeatable competence represents some type that is itself repeatable.</div>
