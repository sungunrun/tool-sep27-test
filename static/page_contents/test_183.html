Scope Hierarchies in Perceptual Content 183</div>
<br><br>
there is certainly no shift of attention and no time to direct attention, unless it is directed <br>
pre-perceptually. Moreover, sometimes different perceptual references, within foveal <br>
vision, have equal psychological priority.<br>
<br>
Changes in scope priority can occur as an initial perception is processed in memory <br>
and re-used in visual search. For example, one may perceive two bodies simultaneously, <br>
with neither having priority over the other. When asked to report which body is to the left <br>
of the other, one might begin to scan a memory or perception, attending first to one body. <br>
The representational content of the state that constitutes this first step gives scope priority <br>
of the referential application to that body, even if the other body is, at the same time, rep-<br>
resented in perception or memory. As one scans from one body to the other, to answer the <br>
question, representation of the other body may become prior even as comparison is made <br>
with a memory of the earlier visual representation in which the first body was prior. Scope <br>
differences on an otherwise identical perceptual (or perceptual-memory-) representa-<br>
tional content are ways of type-identifying the different psychological states in a process of <br>
tracking, scanning, memory, or visual search.188<br>
<br>
Perceptual representational content is <i>not</i> fully determined by the environmental <br>
conditions that would make it accurate. Perceptual representational contents are psy-<br>
cho logic al state kinds. Perceptual representational contents must therefore reflect <br>
 psychological  differences in states, even if the different states are not made veridical (or <br>
accurate) by  different conditions. As in grammar, scope differences can have distinctively <br>
psychological import.<br>
<br>
Issues of scope priority are settled empirically, by considering whether a given referen-<br>
tial application has a role that is psychologically more central than another referential <br>
application in the perceiver’s psychology. This centrality can take a number of forms. The <br>
purported referent of a wide scope determiner might be the focus of attention. Or it might <br>
be the locus for organizing a body of information, guiding action, being more easily <br>
remembered.<br>
<br>
Let us take a case in which referential applications have equally wide scope. If one is <br>
looking at two tigers head on, both equally close and both equally in view, one might <br>
attend to them equally. Although our visual systems do not have the natural-kind at tribu-<br>
tive tiger, they have the attributive body. They have size, shape, and color attributives that <br>
perception can use to zero in on tigers: tiger-shaped tiger-body. The case of equal devotion <br>
of attention with equal scope for the central referential applications can be illustrated as <br>
follows:<br><br>
(ego-here x0)(that x1)(that x2)[equi-distant(c)(x1, x2, x0), body(i)(x1), body(i)(x2)]<br><br>
—that1 body, that2 body, equi-distant from ego-here0.<br><br>

<b>FOOTNOTES</b><br>
<b>Cont FN</b>188 In formulating an all-purpose formal logic, Frege banished from formal language the distinction between <br>
active and passive sentences. He thought it irrelevant to validity. He was right to do so. However, his point of view <br>
encouraged a common modern view that scope differences that do not bear on truth conditions are notational <br>
variants—relevant to formal proof, but not to “real content”. Frege may well have accepted this modern view. He <br>
took senses to be contents of possible (ideal) thought. Ideality for him did exclude a lot of information about <br>
psychological states. However, it included knowledge-perspective, not just ways a thought could be made true or <br>
false. Differences in scope can mark psychological differences. <i>Exactly</i> how he regarded scope differences is <br>
unclear to me.</div>
