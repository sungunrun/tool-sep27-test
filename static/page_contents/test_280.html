op er ations in animals, do not perceive anything. The content of their operations is entirely <br>
derivative from the content of the programmer’s psychological states. The key fact is that <br>
the computers do not do anything to the world with the content. <i>They</i> do not use it. We do. <br>
The judgment leaves open whether certain computerized robots might perceive. Despite <br>
what I take to be such a robot’s lack of consciousness, I have no objection to its perceiving— <br>
if it exhibits perceptual constancies and uses the contents of the sensory states to operate <br>
on the world for itself. Perception is determined by function, not by consciousness. What it <br>
is for a perceptual state to have <i>perceptual</i> constancies—to be capable of perceptually rep-<br>
resenting a given environmental attribute or particular despite significant differences in <br>
proximal stimuli—involves competencies to use the representation in causing representa-<br>
tional responses to the “constant” attribute or particular. Just going into a state that can be <br>
correlated with the attribute or particular, as distinct from the proximal stimulation, is not <br>
enough to represent it.<br>
<br>
To save Gross’s first objection, one could try the idea that the perceptual state and repre-<br>
sentational use state are always simultaneously caused by the proximal stimulus. Here, <br>
clearly the perceptual state would not cause or guide the use state. So the use state would <br>
be misnamed. It would not use the perceptual capacity. The use state would be a collateral, <br>
though functional, effect of the proximal stimulus. The perceptual state is idle in the caus-<br>
ation of the purported use state. It does not guide it. So far, there is no reason to count the <br>
use state as representational. Indeed, it would be a mistake, I think, to take either state to <br>
have representational content, if there were no more to be said about their roles in a repre-<br>
sentational network. So I regard both the objection and this elaboration of it mistaken.<br>
<br>
I do not take the principles that support my position to be self-evident or obvious. I do <br>
think them true. Similar principles in the tradition that I draw on have seemed to have <br>
considerable force for many reflective philosophers. I find steps (1) and (2) powerfully <br>
plausible. I think them apriori. I do not expect all philosophers or lay people to accept <br>
them. I think that lack of acceptance usually bespeaks insufficient reflection, ideological <br>
prejudice, or a focus on objection rather than disinterested inquiry. But like many deep <br>
philosophical issues, these issues are abstract, complex, and hard. There is scope for both <br>
error and deeper illumination.<br>
<br>
Initially, I regarded Gross’s second objection as the stronger one. This objection grants, <br>
for the sake of argument, a time lag between perceptual state and use state. Gross describes <br>
an imagined counter-example to the idea that perceptual states must coordinate with <br>
memory states, and that they thereby must involve temporal representation. He intends <br>
the example to target step (5). I think that the objection is basically to step (3).<br><br>
. . . it would be an objection to (5) if there are cases where one could explain the relevant <br>
<br>
psychological functions, including the role of temporal sensitivity in them, without posit-<br>
<br>
ing temporal representational content. For then positing temporal representational con-<br>
<br>
tent would be explanatorily otiose.<br>
<br>
We may suppose that our simple organism is in but one perceptual state at a time and <br>
<br>
thus that there is but one perceptual state at a time that is poised for use. Let us suppose as <br>
<br>
well that the time lag between perception and use (and indeed between use and etho-<br>
<br>
logic al ly relevant consequences) is so short as to be negligible so far as ethological success <br>
<br>
is concerned. For example, perhaps the organism perceives red and as a result opens an <br>
<br>
orifice that remains open till satiation—or does nothing if already satiated. The redness </div>
