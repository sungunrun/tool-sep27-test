<b>Perceptual Attributives and Referential <br><br>
Applications in Perceptual Constancies<br><br>
</div>
</b>It is a small step now [<i>Es liegt nun</i> <i>nahe</i>] to think of a sign. . . . as being con-<br>
<br>
nected, in addition to its designated entity, which I’d like to call the denotation <br>
<br>
[<i>Bedeutung</i>] of the sign, also what I would like to name the sense of the sign, <br>
<br>
wherein the mode of presentation [<i>Art des Gegebenseins</i>] is contained.<br>
<br>
Gottlob Frege, ‘Über Sinn und Bedeutung’<br><br>
In this chapter, I refine the form and semantics of perceptual attributives and referential <br>
applications. A focus on perceptual constancies contributes to understanding these <br>
matters.<br><br>

<b>Perceptual Constancies and Frege’s Sense–</b><i>Bedeutung</i><b> <br>
<br>
Distinction: Similarities<br><br>
</div>
</b>In <i>Origins of Objectivity</i>, I claimed that we could improve understanding of perceptual <br>
constancies by reflecting on analogies to the informative identity thoughts that Frege used <br>
to illuminate the senses of linguistic expressions and the conceptual contents of thought.201 <br>
I pursue this idea here. I review Frege’s point. Then I explain its analogs in perceptual <br>
constancies. I develop these analogies bearing in mind differences between perception <br>
and thought.<br>
<br>
Frege contrasted two kinds of true identity statements. One has the form <i>a</i> = <i>a</i>. The <br>
other has the form <i>a</i> = <i>b</i>.202 ‘=’ reads: is identical with. In the first kind, the same singular <br>
term occurs on each side of the identity sign. In the second, different singular terms occur <br>
on each side. Frege said that the two types of statement have different “cognitive values”. <br>
He meant by ‘different cognitive values’ different types of ideal understanding with differ-<br>
ent potentials for cognition.<br>
<br>
Frege illustrated his point with a pair of specific identity statements:<br><br>
(a-a) The Morning Star is identical with the Morning Star<br>
<br>
(a-b) The Morning Star is identical with the Evening Star.<br><br>
Clearly, the statement (a-b) and the thought expressed by (a-b) are more informative and <br>
have different cognitive value than (a-a) and the thought expressed by it. (a-a) is a logical <br><br>
