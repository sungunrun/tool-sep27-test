state. But the primary motivation for believing in such huge numbers of distinct psy cho-<br>
logic al occurrences is understanding the complexity of what is represented and seen in <br>
visual perception.<br>
<br>
Another way of thinking how the huge number of referential applications is generated <br>
is to think of them as effects of different light arrays stemming from perceptually dis-<br>
cerned parts of an edge, surface, body, or other physical instance of a surface shape or 3-D <br>
volume shape oriented in 3-D space. Each perceptually discerned part of an entity reflects <br>
a different array of light into the perceptual system. The arrangement of such arrays is kept <br>
track of as perceptual states are formed. Perceptual applications to different parts of a per-<br>
ceived unit are occurrent aspects of the perceptual state that are automatically triggered by <br>
each causal chain associated with each light array. Perceptual references to different, per-<br>
cep tual ly discerned parts of a perceived entity, rely on these causal chains, not only to be <br>
triggered, but also to lead perceptual references back to their distal sources—the different <br>
parts of a perceived distal entity discerned in perception.<br>
<br>
Here is perhaps a good place to warn against over-reading my use of the term ‘picking <br>
out’ in providing informal glosses on singular perceptual reference—on seeing. I have <br>
emphasized that in seeing a natural-unit whole, like a surface perceived as bounded, one <br>
commonly perceives sub-parts that lack natural, salient boundaries. The sub-parts are <br>
seen, but not segmented in the sense of perceived as having boundaries. Such sub-parts <br>
are not normally attended to.<br>
<br>
Take the fully seen left edge of a dead tree trunk, lacking branches. I assume that the left <br>
edge of the visible facing surface that extends from the ground to the treetop is a unit edge. <br>
The changes of edge direction at the top and bottom are so salient that this edge is likely a <br>
natural unit. It is a natural unit, even though it is a part of the whole edge that bounds the <br>
entire visible tree trunk. For simplicity, let us assume that the trunk is smooth, unoccluded, <br>
and unmarked. There are no perceptually segmented sub-units of the left edge—no sig-<br>
nificant changes in direction of the line that marks that edge. The part of an edge of the left <br>
facing surface that extends from 1/3 up the trunk to 5/8 up the trunk, with no salient mark <br>
of those endpoints, has no salient boundaries. Although it is not a part that is likely to <br>
catch one’s attention, it is seen as part of the left edge. It might be regarded as misleading to <br>
say that perception “picks out” that edge segment. Such talk may suggest attention or sali-<br>
ence that is not there. The perceiver does not normally select out that  sub-part from oth-<br>
ers. However, insofar as it is seen, it is picked out—referred to.<br>
<br>
A condition on seeing something is that it be perceptually discriminated from other <br>
entities in the vicinity. Does a perceptual system discriminate parts of the tree trunk edge <br>
that are not perceived as having boundaries that distinguish them from other entities in <br>
the vicinity?<br>
<br>
The answer is clearly ‘yes’. The relevant edge part is seen and perceptually discriminated <br>
from other entities in the vicinity, including other seen but unbounded parts. The visual <br>
system represents it as an edge, as an edge of the surface, as an edge of the surface of the <br>
tree-body. It discriminates this sub-part by representing its position in egocentrically <br>
mapped space and in spatial relations to every other perceived part. Success in perceiving <br>
that part, as distinct from others, rests on the visual system’s accurate representation of it <br>
as an edge, and as being in a given position within the larger position of the left tree-trunk <br>
edge, and on the perceptual state’s being triggered by the causal chain that begins with the <br>
specific light array that reflects off that particular edge part, and ends with the formation Part–Whole Representation  341</div>
