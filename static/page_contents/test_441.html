Methodology for Finding Perceptual Attributives 441</div>
<br><br>
adapting attributive for a given attribute, there is a perceptual attributive for that attribute. <br>
The second type of case blocks this inference. A conceptual attributive can attribute a <br>
property or kind that no perceptual attributive attributes. Its applications can undergo <br>
adaptation because of adaptation in its application base—which <i>is</i> perceptual.<br>
<br>
Ned Block has questioned my claim, ‘In themselves, adaptation tests cannot, even prima <br>
face, determine whether a higher-level attributive is perceptual’. I think that the question-<br>
ing depends on not having gotten straight what is at issue. This is perhaps the fault of <br>
overly compressed exposition of my view in earlier work.561<br>
<br>
Block gives three examples to make his case. The first two are similar. They exemplify <br>
adaptation of color and tilt attributives. Block argues that the adaptation effect is percep-<br>
tual ‘rather than cognitive’. The root of the effect is certainly perceptual. My claim was that <br>
adaptation tests ‘cannot . . . determine whether a higher-level attributive is perceptual’. <br>
Block’s examples do not even consider the fact that applications of <i>conceptualizations</i>  of <br>
perceptual color and tilt attributives will adapt. Then there is an adaptation effect for the <br>
“cognitive” (conceptual) attributive as well as for the root perceptual attributive.562 So <br>
Block’s ‘rather than’ is unsupported. One of the adapting attributives in each of these two <br>
cases is conceptual—assuming human subjects who are capable of using conceptualiza-<br>
tions of color and tilt perceptual attributives. The examples do not show that adaptation <br>
<i>determines</i> an attributive to be perceptual. The examples show only that adapting percep-<br>
tual attributives are involved in, and at the root of, the test. I have never doubted that <br>
point. The two examples cannot show that perceptual adaptation does not ground concep-<br>
tual adaptation that occurs in conceptual attributions (by conceptualizations of perceptual <br>
attributives) that depend for their applications on those of the corresponding perceptual <br>
attributives. These two examples are not only ineffective. They are irrelevant to the claim <br>
that Block quotes as his target. Color and tilt attributives are not higher-level.<br>
<br>
Block’s third example concerns adaptation in attribution of numerosity—approximate <br>
number of ensembles of discrete entities. Relatively simple animals can respond to same-<br>
ness and difference of numerosity. Does attribution of numerosity begin at the perceptual <br>
level or at some supra-perceptual level, perhaps even the conceptual level? Block thinks <br>
that attribution of numerosity can be determined to begin at the perceptual level through <br>
showing that attributions of numerosity adapt. This case is more relevant to the claim that <br><br>

<b>FOOTNOTES</b><br>
<b>Cont FN</b>561 The roots of the discussion lie in these articles: Block, ‘Seeing-As in the Light of Vision Science’; my reply <br>
to this article in Burge, ‘Reply to Block: Adaptation and the Upper Border of Perception’; and Block’s reply to my <br>

562 Block, ‘Tyler Burge on Perceptual Adaptation’, 75. Non-linguistic color attributives, even color groupings of <br>
perceptually discernible shades that correspond roughly to familiar color attributives (blue, green, red), are pre-<br>
sent pre-linguistically in 4-month-old human infants. Color attributives associated with language are similar, <br>
although there are differences both across languages and between linguistic attributions by adults, on one hand, <br>
and pre-linguistic attributions by children, on the other. For a review, see A. Franklin, ‘Infant Color Categories’, in <br>
M. Luo ed., <i>Encyclopedia of Color Science and Technology</i> (New York: Springer, 2013). Linguistic color attribution <br>
(grouping) seems to develop initially by different mechanisms from those producing the antecedent non-<br>
linguistic color groupings. Of course, linguistic practice can yield habits of attention that add to or adjust ante-<br>
cedent color groupings in perception, just as any task-based repeated practice could. As far as I know, it is an <br>
open question whether there are linguistically based color groupings that lack perceptual counterparts that indi-<br>
cate the same color band. The thoroughly fought over issues regarding relations between linguistic and non-<br>
linguistic groupings are still alive. The present issues about adaptation are unlikely to be affected by outcomes. <br>
Any color grouping applicable through vision uses a perceptual attributive capacities, at least capacities to see <br>
and attribute more specific shades within the grouping. Groupings of larger bands, whether perceptual or con-<br>
ceptual, will adapt if responses to the more specific shades that are grouped adapt.</div>
