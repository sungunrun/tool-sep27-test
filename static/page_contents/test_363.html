representation, visual perceptual representational has a representational structure analo-<br>
gous to a 2-D matrix. This structure maps naturally and representationally into parts of a <br>
3-D spatial structure. Unlike sculptures and unlike touch, where objects can be repre-<br>
sented literally in the round, visual perceptual structure is picture-like in some important <br>
respects. Normally, 3-D entities are visually perceived only by perceiving their facing <br>
surfaces.<br>
<br>
In linear, symbolic, non-iconic, noun-phrase specifications of visual representational <br>
contents, the attributives must be construed not as symbols, but as attributive aspects of a <br>
perspectival, picture-like, iconic representation of attributes and their instances in a 3-D <br>
environment. Perceptual attributives are all iconic. Nevertheless, the huge matrix has the <br>
same <i>fundamental</i>  representational form as a hugely complex noun-phrase. The seman-<br>
tics of this matrix-formatted representational content has the same accuracy conditions, <br>
with the same referential and attributional structure, as a corresponding noun phrase.<br>
<br>
The linear presentations of perceptual content that I use are, then, abstractions. They <br>
are abstractions from what is actually, in the representational content of a perceptual state, <br>
an iconic array of referential applications and perceptual attributives. The array is set in a <br>
matrix-like framework for representing properties of and relations among perceived <br>
particulars.<br>
<br>
To discuss specifics of any perceptual representational content, one must abstract and <br>
simplify. To maintain perspective on what is being discussed, however, one must bear in <br>
mind the iconic character and dizzying representational complexity of the contents of <br>
 perceptual states. The complexity is psychologically and computationally manageable <br>
<i>because</i> of its iconic format. Of course, the iconic aspects of representation come naturally. <br>
They derive from pre-representational, natural relations encoded in the marrow of our <br>
phys ic al being.<br><br>
