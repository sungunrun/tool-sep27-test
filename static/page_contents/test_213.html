representational contents, the differences in psychological patterns evince different states <br>
with different representational contents.<br>
<br>
So the representational contents in the second pair differ from one another. The differ-<br>
ences do not reside in occurrence-based applications alone. They reside in ability-general <br>
modes of presentation—different ways in which purportedly perceived entities are pre-<br>
sented and represented. The different modes of presentation are different psychological <br>
competencies. Since there are representational differences, there are different perceptual <br>
states, with different representational contents. The differences concern how the color-<br>
shade-instance is perceived. The only relevant, ability-general differences in representa-<br>
tional contents are differences in perceptual attributives.<br><br>

<b>Perceptual Constancies and Frege’s Sense–</b><i>Bedeutung</i><b> <br>
<br>
Distinction: Differences<br><br>
</div>
</b>An important difference between perceptual constancies and Frege’s cases is that there is <br>
no use of any attributive for <i>identity</i> in perceptual representational content. Identity is a <br>
predicate that functions to form propositional structures. Using it attributively would <br>
form a propositional structure. Perceptual representational content is not propositional.<br>
<br>
In Chapter 3, I described perceptual constancies this way:<br><br>
(PC)  Perceptual constancies are perceptual capacities systematically to represent a given <br>
<br>
environmental particular or attribute <i>as</i> that particular or attribute under significant <br>
<br>
differences in registration of proximal stimulation.<br><br>
In <i>Origins of Objectivity</i>, I described perceptual constancies this way:<br><br>
Perceptual constancies are perceptual capacities systematically to represent a given en vir-<br>
<br>
on mental particular or attribute as the same despite significant variations in registration <br>
<br>
of proximal stimulation.206<br><br>
I intended this formulation to be equivalent to the more perspicuous (PC). However, ‘as <br>
the same’, in the <i>Origins</i> explication, suggested to some that I thought that perceptual sys-<br>
tems have attributives like is the same as or is identical with. That was never my view. Is <br>
identical with yields a propositional structure when it is completed with two singular rep-<br>
resentational contents. There are no propositional structures in perceptual systems. <br>
Moreover, different occurrent perceptions in a perceptual constancy do not form single <br>
psychological states. There is not one representational content here, as there is in a thought <br>
of the form a = b. The constancy is a competence to produce different perceptual states <br>
with different representational contents that share a constant <i>representatum</i>. The states <br>
represent the same <i>representatum</i> in different ways.<br>
<br>
The competence is one to respond perceptually to a given attribute through applications <br>
of different attributives—responding to the given attribute in different perceptual <br><br>
