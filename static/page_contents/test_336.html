336 The Iconic Nature of Perception</div>
<br><br>
This general point was recognized by the Gestalt psychologists. Local registrations of <br>
edge segments in the retinal image are combined through various grouping principles to <br>
yield registrations of edges in the retinal image, and ultimately perceptual representations <br>
of environmental edges. Grouping principles include those of continuity, proximity, sym-<br>
metry, and similarity of size, shape, and direction.366<br>
<br>
Once a system generates perceptual states, it operates with natural-unit wholes—for <br>
example, the edge that surrounds a leaf, or the facing surface of an animal.367<br>
<br>
Many non-salient parts of perceptually natural wholes are seen essentially <i>as</i> parts of <br>
the larger wholes. This point includes <i>smallest perceptually discernible parts</i> of natural-unit <br>
wholes. When one perceptually plots an edge in a visual spatial framework, one plots <br>
smaller parts of the edge. Since the edge is plotted in a map-like framework, representing <br>
the whole <i>involves</i> representing parts. Usually, one cannot see the orientation, length, <br>
shape of a smallest perceived edge part, if it is not perceived as a part of a whole. The <br>
orien ta tion, length, shape of a smallest part, if attributed at all, is determined by percep-<br>
tual extrapolation from its place in a whole, whose counterpart properties in the edge-area <br>
surrounding the smallest part are perceptually determined.<br>
<br>
The shape, orientation, size of an edge, surface, and so on, frequently cannot be per cep-<br>
tual ly determined except in relation to further entities beyond the boundaries of the edge or <br>
surface. For example, frequently, a background is needed to determine spatial properties of <br>
entities in the foreground. Perceptual representation of the part–whole relation does not <br>
cross natural perceptual wholes. Although the process of forming a perceptual attributive for <br>
a surface is not independent of representing a background or foreground for the surface, the <br>
surface itself can be perceptually specified through an attributive that does not itself specify <br>
the background, or any larger circumstance that includes the  surface as sub-part.<br>
<br>
So even when one’s perceptual system cannot perceptually determine the spatial prop-<br>
erties of an entity except in relation to a larger group of entities in which the entity is <br>
embedded, and even though, as a perceptual state specifies an entity (say, a surface), it also <br>
specifies further entities (say, a background) beyond that entity, it does not follow that <br>
the entity is <i>perceived as</i> a part of some larger whole. The part–whole attributive in visual <br>
perception is not so liberal. Grouping behavior provides no support for such liberality. <br>
Perceptual attribution of part–whole relations always occurs with respect to wholes of <br>
the same perceptually represented natural units. Perception does not take “wholes” that <br>
consist of entities and their backgrounds as natural units.<br>
<br>
Let us return to the ‘delicate question’ broached above: What parts of a natural-unit <br>
entity are represented whenever the whole natural-unit entity is represented? I assume <br>
that when we perceive a whole, like an edge, surface, or body, we perceive some of its <br>
parts. I assume that there are smallest perceptually discernible parts. As a tentative <br><br>
