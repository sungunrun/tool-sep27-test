Ability-General Long-Term Visual Perceptual Memory 615</div>
<br><br>
Ability-general long-term visual perceptual memories retain the form of demonstrative-<br>
like reference, basic to perception. Assignments of schematic elements (variables) to par-<br>
ticulars—the anaphoric or other tracking connections to original perceptual referential <br>
applications and to perceived particulars—have been lost. What remains is a con fig ur ation <br>
of perceptual attributives, open to singular, recognitional applications with new percep-<br>
tions. The memories do not <i>quantify</i>. The singular elements are schematic. Occurrence-<br>
based referential applications in past perceptions are washed out in the memories. The <br>
schemas are residues of past singular applications and vessels for being filled with new <br>
ones, or for being re-filled by reconnecting with old ones.<br>
<br>
The syntactically or formally singular structures are schematic and semantically gen-<br>
eral. Occurrence-based referential applications do not apply the schemas to past-perceived <br>
particulars. The schemas can be accurate <i>of</i> past-perceived particulars, but they are not <br>
accurate or inaccurate. Much learning that uses long-term memory with this schematic <br>
form. I discussed schematic form in Chapter 6, the section Absence in Perception <br>
of Negations, Conditionals, Disjunctions, and Quantifiers. The form, <br>
assuming memory mode, is:<br><br>
(nowego t1)(that x)(that y)[Fa1(i)(y), Fa1(c)(x, t0), Gb1(i)(x), before(c)(t0, t1)]<br><br>
There are no perceptual referential applications for variables ‘x’ and ‘y’. The past time sche-<br>
matized by ‘t0’ is constrained in this example only as being before the present time of the <br>
memory. Perceptual associations are often stored in ability-general long-term memory.<br>
<br>
Conceptual memory contents can also have this schematically general structure. Some <br>
long-term memory is propositional or conceptual. Long-term retention of beliefs involves <br>
retention of propositional content. Concepts, which function constitutively to contribute to <br>
propositional states, can be stored in forms that are not propositions. For example, the <br>
conceptual-attributive schema, tennis player(x), might be associated with high subjective <br>
probability with (person(x) & wealthy(x)). The form is that of a propositional schema, not <br>
a proposition.<br>
<br>
In being schematic, ability-general memories are not accurate or inaccurate, true or <br>
false. Their representational success consists in being <i>accurate of</i>, or <i>true of</i>, past-perceived <br>
particulars.<br>
<br>
All perceptual attributives in perceptual memory provide an iconic perceptual mode of <br>
presentation.959 Although perceptual attributives in ability-general long-term visual per-<br>
ceptual memory must have visual modes of presentation, they may not be the specific <br>
mode of presentation of any past visual perception. The retained perceptual attributives <br>
could be amalgams, perhaps averages by some similarity criterion, of perceptual attribu-<br>
tives earlier applied in perception. Such amalgams are representationally successful inas-<br>
much as they sum up or typify past-applied perceptual attributives. Attributes are usually <br>
remembered in combinations.<br>
<br>
One function of long-term ability-general memory is to connect seen objects with their <br>
normal contexts. Categorization of out-of-context objects is harder and slower. Interaction <br>
between ability-general memory and perception occurs late in the process of <br><br>
