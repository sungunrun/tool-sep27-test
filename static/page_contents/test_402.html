role that Treisman postulated. Campbell plausibly claims that the attention that effects <br>
binding in perception is unconscious. The other role is that of fixing a demonstrated object <br>
in thought that relies on perception of the object. He claims that in this role attention must <br>
be conscious.478<br>
<br>
Demonstrative-like reference, referential application, begins in perception. Perception’s <br>
primary function is to pick out particulars, partly via contextual, causal relations. A com-<br>
petence to pick out, contextually, particulars is a demonstrative-like competence.<br>
<br>
Demonstrative-like reference in perception does not depend on binding. Instances of <br>
properties, tropes, are picked out contextually, whether or not they are bound to other <br>
properties in reference to a bearer. Every perceptual state involves at least one referential <br>
application, which functions to pick out a particular. As we have seen, in natural scenes, <br>
perception of adequately spaced objects does not depend on attention. So seeing objects <br>
with bound properties, which involves demonstrative-like reference in perception, does <br>
not depend on attention.<br>
<br>
Campbell argues that conscious, post-binding attention is necessary for demonstrative <br>
reference to objects in <i>thought</i>. He claims that to “grasp” or “understand” a demonstrative, <br>
one must consciously attend to the object that the demonstrative picks out in perceptual <br>
experience.<br>
<br>
He argues as follows:<br><br>
You might acknowledge that ordinarily we would use visual information to interpret the <br>
<br>
demonstrative, but question whether it has to be conscious. The idea of visual informa-<br>
<br>
tion that is not conscious is made vivid by cases of blindsight. A blindsight patient is one <br>
<br>
who . . . has no awareness of objects in one half of his visual field. Nonetheless, when forced <br>
<br>
to guess about what is in the blind field, he may be reliably correct about, for example, the <br>
<br>
orientation, direction, and sort of the object in the blindfield. . . . Couldn’t this subject use <br>
<br>
such visual information to achieve an understanding of a visual demonstrative? . . . we <br>
<br>
could try supposing as a thought experiment that we have a subject who has all the rele-<br>
<br>
vant visual information but is not yet conscious of the object in the blind field <br>
<br>
(. . . ‘super-blindsight’).<br>
<br>
. . . [C]onsider an ordinary case in which you and I are sitting at a dinner table with a <br>
<br>
large number of people around and you make a remark to me about ‘that woman’ . . .  <br>
<br>
I cannot consciously single out the person you mean. All I get consciously is a sea of <br>
<br>
faces. Now we add some of what the blindseer has. You refuse to give me any further <br>
<br>
clues as to which person you mean, but you say, ‘Try to point to the woman I mean’. At <br>
<br>
first I protest that I can’t do that . . . but I do try to point, and to my surprise you say I’m <br>
<br>
pointing right at the person you mean. Suppose now that my conscious experience <br>
<br>
remains a sea of faces, but extend the reach of my reliable guessing so that it encom-<br>
<br>
passes everything the blindseer can do. So I can make reliable guesses about what the <br>
<br>
person is eating, wearing, and so on, as well as reaching and pointing appropriately. As <br><br>

ignore the peculiar view here. It is incompatible with the perceptual psychology, indeed with Treisman’s own <br>
view. I have criticized this sort of view elsewhere: Burge, ‘Disjunctivism and Perceptual Psychology’; T. Burge, <br>
