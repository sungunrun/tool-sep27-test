conditions. Mammals can, within limits, perceive a given surface shape or 3-D volume <br>
shape as that shape whether it is straight-on, slanted, or rotated. Size constancy is a cap-<br>
acity to represent a given size despite differences in proximal stimulation that derive from <br>
entities at different distances. Object-position constancy is a capacity to represent a per-<br>
ceived entity as at a given distance and direction, under various stimulus conditions, <br>
deriving from various types of entities perceived. Many visual systems, some auditory <br>
systems, and the sonar echolocation systems of bats, whales, and dolphins exhibit object-<br>
position constancy. Color and lightness constancies are capacities to represent a given <br>
color or lightness as that color or lightness under a variety of stimulus conditions, includ-<br>
ing differences in illumination. Object constancy is the capacity to represent a given body <br>
or surface under a variety of conditions—such as occlusion, changes in position and <br>
shape, and so on. Many birds and perhaps all mammals exhibit visual object constancy.<br>
<br>
I re-emphasize that the initial formula I used in introducing ‘perceptual constancy’ is <br>
not a definition. It is just an initial frame. The frame will be filled in by reflecting on the <br>
science’s applications of the term to cases, and through understanding those cases as con-<br>
cretizations of the abstract notion of objectification. Even in the absence of a definition—<br>
operational or otherwise—scientists tend to agree on what capacities are perceptual <br>
constancies.<br>
<br>
Like perceptual states, non-perceptual sensory states often result from grouping aspects <br>
of the proximal stimulus into equivalence classes. The grouping in production of both <br>
non-perceptual registrational states and perceptual states takes various forms—filtering, <br>
weighted averaging, and so on.47 Pre-perceptual operations are often, like perceptual <br>
operations, ways of making the state fit aspects of the environment more closely than the <br>
proximal stimulus does. Although some sensory registration results from simple imprints <br>
of a proximal stimulus, many pre-perceptual operations between pre-perceptual sensory <br>
registrations group different proximal stimuli as equivalent. They produce what are called <br>
‘invariances’. The pre-perceptual operations that produce non-perceptual invariances are <br>
steps toward objectification. Their formation should not, however, be conflated with true <br>
objectification in perception, or true perceptual constancies.<br>
<br>
What makes perceptual constancies <i>perceptual</i> is that, unlike their non-perceptual sen-<br>
sory analogs, the formation of states in a perceptual constancy is not as well <i>causally</i> <br>
explained by taking these states to derive from invariances in the proximal stimulus as <br>
they are explained as deriving from invariances in specific aspects of the distal en vir on-<br>
ment.48 Both sensory non-perceptual states and perceptual states are <i>functionally</i> explained <br>
by reference to the distal environment, of course. The selection, and hence bio logic al func-<br>
tion, of <i>both</i> types of state is explained by reference to interaction with certain survival-<br>
relevant aspects of an animal’s ecology. What is special about causal explanation in <br><br>

<b>FOOTNOTES</b><br>
<b>Cont FN</b>47 In <i>Origins of Objectivity</i>, 399, I mistakenly wrote as if averaging and weighting were in themselves non-<br>
perceptual operations. They can be mechanisms that contribute to perceptual constancies. This mistake was <br>
pointed out to me by Shimon Ullman.<br>
48 The science’s causal explanation, as distinct from functional explanation, of these non-perceptual sensory-<br>
registrational states does not and need not identify them in terms of any connection to entities in the distal <br>
environment. The science’s causal explanation of perceptual states individuates the states partly in terms of what <br>
they connect to (and function to represent) in the distal macro-environment. (It also individuates them in terms <br>
of the <i>way</i> they represent what they represent. Different ways are associated with different types of proximal <br>
stimulation, which are associated with different angles or perspectives on the environmental <i>representatum</i>.) See <br>
