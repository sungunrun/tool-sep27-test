longer than 1–1.2 seconds.259 This period may mark something like the longest unit in <br>
which applications of perception occur that do not depend on transformations guided by <br>
the individual.<br>
<br>
A further natural interval corresponds to the longest specific “present” that marks a <br>
whole visual perception. It is the interval between saccades. Once a saccade occurs, a new <br>
viewing angle is established. There is a role for memory that connects one perception with <br>
its viewing angle with the next (post-saccadic) perception with <i>its</i> viewing angle. (See <br>
Chapter 16, the section Trans-Saccadic Memory.) Since saccades occur, on average, <br>
about every 330 ms, I take one natural present-tense interval for visual perception in <br>
humans to be, on average, about 330 ms.<br>
<br>
Some time-sensitive processing is carried out from very brief exposures, inside 330 ms. <br>
Individuals can perceive motion, speed of motion, and other changes, well within these <br>
time limits. Such representation requires representation of temporal order and sometimes <br>
temporal metric. The shortest interval over which events can be perceived as temporally <br>
successive is about 30–50 ms.260 So there are representations of times or temporal rela-<br>
tions that are of this magnitude.<br>
<br>
Perception of motion over such brief intervals was one impetus for the currently widely <br>
held scientific view that motion is a primitive perceptual category, not one constructed out <br>
of separate representations of position and time.261 Timing at these intervals depends <br>
more on derivative association with the beginning and ending of the motion. Further <br>
ground to take motion representation as a perceptual primitive emerged with the discov-<br>
ery of individual cortical cells whose firing depends on location, direction, and speed of <br>
motion on the retina.262<br>
<br>
Timing in perception occurs at different scales above this 30 ms limit. It derives from <br>
integration of information over time intervals, which in turn requires internally generated <br>
or externally caused signals over an interval. Early proposals about time determination <br>
assumed a central timer.263 It has long been known, however, that there are many timing <br>
mechanisms tuned to different tasks. Some timers time large intervals or periods, such as <br>
seasonal changes or circadian rhythms.264 Within any given perceptual system of rea son-<br>
able complexity, there are also various specialized timing mechanisms operating at the <br>
same time.<br><br>
