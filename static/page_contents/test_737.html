Emergence of Representational Mind 737</div>
<br><br>
The first perceptual constancies were probably simple lightness constancies and per-<br>
haps size and ordinal depth constancies. Spatial constancies marked a major change in <br>
how animals coped with their environments. Action based on non-perceptual sensing had <br>
to track distant target-objects or avoidance-objects by serially sampling proximal stimuli, <br>
as in homing. An animal could be drawn to food or a mate by following up the intensity <br>
and directionality of a smell. Or action could rely on play-back of something previously <br>
sensed serially—as in pre-perceptual path integration. But action could not be guided in <br>
the moment by sensing specifically localized (or regionalized) entities at a distance. Visual <br>
and auditory spatial constancies gave action new scope for responding to entities at a dis-<br>
tance. This scope opened room for new flexibility in action, and for early antecedents of <br>
planning. So perception enlarged action, which is mainly why it evolved.<br>
<br>
Two connected representational capacities emerge with perception. One is the picking-<br>
out or referential capacity. The other is the characterizing or attributional capacity. I think <br>
that both appear in all representational psychologies, no matter how complex. Attribution <br>
is the essential representational sub-capacity, present in every representation.<br>
<br>
The referential capacity uses causal connection to particulars present in all sensing. <br>
Sensing is constitutively cause-dependent. Relevant causes are always concrete particulars. <br>
Pre-perceptually, animals were sensing objects and tropes—concrete instances of kinds <br>
and properties–and associated attributes. Sensing particulars became perception of <br>
them—perceptual reference—when attribution, embedded in perceptual constancies, <br>
selected and represented sensed particulars as being of specific types, among the welter of <br>
types of merely sensed particulars. The basic constancies were for attributes. They made <br>
possible constancies in tracking particulars. So attribution heightened the merely sensory <br>
causal relation to particulars into perceptual reference. Attribution and reference neces-<br>
sarily operate together in perception. But constancies for attributes were the lever that <br>
raised sensing particulars into referring to them.<br>
<br>
Picking out particulars, perceptual reference, became a selective, focused, specific type of <br>
sensing. Perceptual reference is the main specific representational function of perception <br>
(under the generic representational function of being accurate). Picking out particulars as <br>
targets of action served biological needs. It served focused, specific, local, current encoun-<br>
ters with particulars—encounters important to the organism’s survival and reproduction.<br>
<br>
Attribution not only focused and made specific the causal relations to particulars that <br>
non-perceptual sensing already provided—allowing them to be representational and ref-<br>
erential. It also co-opted the iconic structures of pre-representational sensing. (See Chapter 9, <br>
the section Iconic Perception, Iconic Concepts, Iconic Representation <br>
in Propositional Thought.)<br>
<br>
So new types of state, competence, function, and form were grafted onto the root stock <br>
of pre-perceptual sensory registration. The new kind of state was a perceptual state, indi-<br>
viduated by the conditions that it sets for being accurate. Since being accurate depends on <br>
occurrent exercise of a repeatable perceptual state type, accuracy conditions include such <br>
occurrent exercises. The occurrent exercises are both referential applications that function <br>
to pick out causes, and attributional applications that function to connect perceptual <br>
attributives to the referents.<br>
<br>
The new <i>competencies</i>, reference and attribution, are grounded in perceptual constan-<br>
cies. The constancies enable perceivers to track attributes and particulars in the distal <br>
environment.</div>
