260 Egocentric Indexing</div>
<br><br>
In human binocular vision, this origin would commonly be at the cyclopean eye—the <br>
mid-point between a perceiver’s eyes. In a human actional representational framework, an <br>
origin might be a position on the agent’s right elbow or hand. Such origins may vary  <br>
within a representational system, depending on the task. For some tasks—such as grasping— <br>
there may be several origins in a representational system at a given time.<br>
<br>
An <i>egocentric representational framework</i> is one that is representer-centered and repre-<br>
sents its origin as privileged with respect to the individual’s needs, action target, and per-<br>
spective. An <i>egocentric index</i> is an element of representational content that functions to be <br>
referentially applied to origin positions or anchor positions of egocentric representational <br>
frameworks.<br>
<br>
Egocentric indexes mark powers with two constitutive functions.249 One is to represent <br>
the origin or anchor of a representational framework in an <i>indexical</i> way. An indexical <br>
way of representing is a way that is context-dependent, and is governed by a general rule <br>
whose application is automatic, given a competent application in a context. ‘I’, ‘now’, ‘yes-<br>
terday’, ‘here’ are indexicals in language. Analogs occur in perception and thought.<br>
<br>
The other function is to mark the origin or anchor as having privileged status with <br>
respect to the individuals’s needs, action targets, and perspective. Referentially applied <br>
schematic egocentric indexes in perception do not represent the individual, or the indi-<br>
vidual’s needs, action targets, or perspectives. They have ego-relevant status by marking <br>
competencies that are functionally, architecturally connected, in the psychology, to those <br>
needs, action targets, and perspectives, in a relatively direct way. If a perception or actional <br>
state that represents that origin is threatened, a psychological state containing an egocen-<br>
tric index triggers an immediate protective response.<br>
<br>
Egocentric indexicals represent indexically, as the linguistic examples do. They have an <br>
ego-relevant status in a psychology. Such status seems not to be part of the <i>linguistic mean-<br>
ings</i> of corresponding linguistic indexicals (excepting ‘I’). In psychologies, the status is <br>
part of the representational content of egocentric indexes. Realizing the two constitutive <br>
functions of egocentric indexes provides the representational basis for an individual’s <br>
doing things for itself. The unity of individuals that have representational psychologies <br>
consists partly in having representational powers that unify and distinguish those indi-<br>
viduals and their psychologies from the rest of the world, by realizing these two functions.<br>
<br>
The anchors or origins of egocentric representational frameworks in perception are not <br>
referred to by being perceived. They are not referred to through referential application of <br>
perceptual attributives, that guide contextual, causal contact with particulars. The in dex-<br>
ic al representation by egocentric indexes derives from a systematic ability-general compe-<br>
tence that applies to a particular—the origin of a representational framework in a given <br>
context—by virtue of structural features of the system exercised in a context.<br>
<br>
In perception, spatial representation is the most salient source of the iconic structure of <br>
perceptual representational content—including a systematic, part–whole representational <br>
relation between representational structure and represented subject matter.<br><br>
