324 The Iconic Nature of Perception</div>
<br><br>
It is obvious that realist pictures, maps, and perceptions—paradigms of iconic representa-<br>
tion—can be accurate or inaccurate. Empirical evidence that perceptions are iconic is <br>
overwhelming.<br>
<br>
Where iconic representation is appropriately committal, it carries “ontological commit-<br>
ments”—contrary to (f). Perception is <i>committal</i>, in that it presents the world as being a <br>
certain way, and undergoes a certain sort of failure—a representational failure—if the <br>
world is not as the perception represents it.349 Whereas perception is constitutively com-<br>
mittal, maps and realist paintings are not. They can be presented whimsically or as fic-<br>
tions. Most maps and many paintings presented as depicting real entities are committal.<br>
<br>
Fodor does not explain his understanding of the phrase, ‘impose principles of individu-<br>
ation’. On any normal construal, contrary to (g), some iconic perceptual states pick out <br>
bodies as bodies, and can track them. Picking out and tracking bodies as bodies requires <br>
operating according to principles that determine when bodies are the same and when they <br>
are different.<br>
<br>
Contrary to (h), iconic representation is representation-as. <i>Every</i> attribution to a par-<br>
ticular in a realist painting, map, and perceptual state is a representation-as.350 Attributions <br>
are characterizations. Characterizations are representations-as.<br>
<br>
Again, the master methodological error in PP(1) and PP(2΄) is inferring semantical <br>
structure directly from iconic format, instead of from use and representational competen-<br>
cies.351 A subsidiary mistake derives from conflating information registration with repre-<br>
sentation, which has veridicality conditions as an aspect of its nature. Either can be iconic. <br><br>

379–381; Burge, ‘Origins of Perception’, 25–28; and Chapter 2, the section The Three Fundamental <br>
Representational Constituents in Perceptual States. Fodor elides the difference between infor-<br>
mation registration and genuine representation, calling both ‘representation’. He assimilates iconic representa-<br>
tion to information registration. For discussion of the distinction, see Burge, <i>Origins of Objectivity</i>, chapter 8; <br>
Burge, ‘Origins of Perception’, 2–5; Burge, ‘Perception: Where Mind Begins’; and Chapter 2, the section <br>
Representation and Information Registration.<br>
351 Fodor argues that some psychological states, for example those in what he calls an ‘echoic buffer’, are <br>
iconic, but that they only “register”, or carry statistical information about, ‘two-dimensional shape, shading, <br>
color, and so forth’. Such “representation” is not <i>representation</i> in my terminology. It is merely information-<br>
registration. Fodor goes out of his way here to explicate registration, and he does so in a way very close to the way <br>
I do. He thinks that object properties like <i>animal</i> are not iconically represented (in my sense): ‘that requires con-<br>
ceptualization’, Fodor, <i>LOT 2: The Language of Thought Revisited</i>, 185–186. The implication is that (a)–(h) applies <br>
only to conceptualized states, which are, for Fodor, <i>ipso facto</i> non-iconic. These ideas are incompatible with <br>
knowledge in perceptual psychology. Fodor does not discuss perceptions, as distinct from registrations, as of <br>
two-dimensional surface shape or as of color. Such representations are unquestionably iconic. Not only these <br>
perceptual attributions, but perceptual attributions as of 3-D volume shape and perceptual categorizations—for <br>
example, such attributions as of <i>impala-body</i> (see note 296)—are perceptual, non-conceptual, and iconic.<br>
Fodor perhaps did not know that there are not only iconic field maps in the brain that correspond to the <br>
2-D shape and size aspects of the proximal stimulus, but also iconic field maps in the brain that correspond to <br>
<i>distal</i> properties—specifically 2-D and 3-D shape properties. These maps ground the idea that there are iconic <br>
attributions in perception of properties in the distal environment, not merely registrations of 2-D analogs in the <br>
retinal image. (See Chapter 3, the chapter Retinal Image Contour Registration and Surface <br>
Contour Perception; and this chapter, the section Iconic Aspects of Perceptual Spatial <br>
Representation.) Moreover, categorization-attributions of kinds like <i>animal-body</i> are products of the per-<br>
ceptual system, and go entirely by way of iconic representations of animal-shape, animal-size, animal-motion. <br>
They are distinct from the shape, size, and motion representations in being supplemented by dispositions to <br>
anticipate continuity, and by conative dispositions. But their representation depends on and makes essential use <br>
of the iconic shape, size, and motion representation from which they are formed. There is nothing conceptual <br>
about the representations. (See this chapter, prologue; and Chapters 10–12.) Their modes of presentation are <br>
iconic—through the application-base shape-size-motion modes of presentation that always trigger them. (See <br>
note 296 again, and accompanying text.) I think Fodor’s account of discursiveness no better than his account of <br>
iconicity, but I do not discuss it.</div>
