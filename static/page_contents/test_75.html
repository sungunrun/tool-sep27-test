non-perceptual invariances contribute to fitness 75</div>
<br><br>
From one point of view, one might say that there is objective relevance almost all the <br>
way down. If one relied only on the notion of objective relevance in determining where <br>
perception begins, one might just about scrap the sensing/perceiving distinction. On such <br>
a view, the lower bound of objective relevance would be roughly where sensing begins. <br>
One might even drive the point beyond the sensing by very simple organisms, like worms <br>
and bacteria, to the adapted sensitivities of plants. There are people, including a few scien-<br>
tists, who embrace such views. I think them wrong. I think that they do not map well onto <br>
the actual practice of relevant sciences. I think that they constitute a glib reductionism <br>
that ignores basic psychological kinds.<br>
<br>
Objective relevance and objectification should be distinguished. Objectification is a pro-<br>
cess that distinguishes states that merely register aspects of proximal stimulation from states <br>
that are cues to very <i>specific</i> distal conditions. The process is fully effected in perceptual con-<br>
stancies: the same representational bet on the same specific environmental condition can be <br>
made despite significant differences in proximal stimulation. Of course, making such bets <br>
must be on the basis of aspects of proximal stimuli. Bets on a specific distal stimulus are <br>
made from cues that share generic features with very different proximal stimuli. All process-<br>
ing of proximal stimuli was molded by learning or evolution and has objective, <i>biological</i>, <br>
<i>functional</i> relevance. But some processing yields cues in proximal stimuli that recur across <br>
significantly different proximal stimuli and correlate well with very specific distal conditions.<br>
<br>
The objectification process grounds representational laws that connect first-registrations <br>
of proximal stimuli (at various levels of abstraction) with representational states that make <br>
representational bets on one of the numerous actual and possible environmental conditions <br>
that could have caused it. The distinguishing, objectification process occurs through <br>
 mediation of specifically representation laws. Objective <i>biological functional</i> relevance to <br>
specific aspects of the distal environment is present in all or nearly all sensory states, other <br>
than proprioceptive ones. Representational relevance is specific to perceptual states. It is <br>
the upshot of objectification, in causal formation processes. Understanding objectification <br>
is sharpened by considering examples, the task this chapter.<br>
<br>
A second fact that complicates understanding perceptual psychology’s practice of dis-<br>
tinguishing perceptual constancies as a significant kind is that there are invariances (one <br>
might have called them ‘constancies’) in computations on nearly all non-perceptual sen-<br>
sory states. In processing sensory information, nearly all sensory systems filter initial <br>
regis tra tions of proximal stimulation. This filtering produces equivalence classes or sen-<br>
sory kinds that span differences in proximal stimulation. So even non-perceptual sensing <br>
usually involves invariances and are <i>called</i> ‘invariances’. A variety of different proximal <br>
stimulations yield a single type of registration. Often the registrations do not bring <br>
together “<i>significantly</i>” different registrations of proximal stimulations, as our explication <br>
of ‘perceptual constancy’ requires. But what weight can the vague term ‘significantly’ bear? <br>
Why should we not count all registrations as constancies or invariances, and not single out <br>
any as <i>perceptual</i> constancies? Why should we not just count the range of differences <br>
among registrations of proximal stimulations that lead to such registrations simply a “mat-<br>
ter of degree”? Why should perceptual constancies be singled out for special interest? Do <br>
they really mark an important kind?<br>
<br>
When bacteria respond differently to light and dark, many different proximal stimula-<br>
tions over several day times, projecting different amounts of light, produce sensory states <br>
in bacteria that are equivalent in producing a single aversive response to light.</div>
