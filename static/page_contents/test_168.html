perception of a particular.179 Of course, if reference to a property-instance fails, attribution <br>
of the property-type to the instance fails. One cannot successfully attribute a property to a <br>
property-instance if one does not represent the instance.<br>
<br>
Perceptual representational content marks conditions for perceptual veridicality and <br>
perceptual representational success. So any veridicality conditions that omit a referential <br>
application to an attribute-instance would not mark the correct veridicality conditions for <br>
the perceptual state. In the case in which one perceptually attributes <i>brown</i> to a brown <br>
object, and the brownness is not perceived, then the perception would fail to be accurate <br>
because the instance of brownness is not perceived. The referential application that func-<br>
tions to apply <i>de re</i> to an instance of brownness fails to refer. In such a case, what causes <br>
the perceptual referential application is not the instance of brownness in the body, but a <br>
confluence of other factors that yield an illusion of brownness. Again, perceptual at tribu-<br>
tives should be recognized as typically accompanying their own proprietary referential <br>
applications. There are exceptions—mainly for relational attributives. I discuss those, this <br>
chapter, the section Perceptual Attribution of Relations.180<br>
<br>
A better approximation to the form of a perception as of a brown, cubical body than<br><br>
(that x1)(brown(x1), cubical(x1), body(x1)),<br><br>
is:<br><br>
(that x1)[(that x2)(that x3)(brown(x1), brown(x2), cubical(x1), cubical(x3), body(x1))].<br><br>
This form will be refined in the next section. I discuss this approximation here. The <br>
attributives brown and cubical make two attributions each. Let us focus on the two attri-<br>
butions by the perceptual attributive brown to the body. One is the attribution familiar <br>
from language. For example, in ‘that brown body’, ‘brown’ functions to attribute <i>brown</i> to a <br>
body. In our example, brown functions similarly. That function is marked by the fact that <br>
the referential application that x1 (which functions to pick out a body) binds and effects <br>
the attribution brown(x1). The other attribution (brown(x2)) is an attribution of <i>brown</i> to <br>
the instance of <i>brown</i>. The property-instance, not just the body, is seen.<br>
<br>
The representational content implies that the perceptual state not only functions to char-<br>
acterize the body by attributing the type <i>brown</i>, but also functions to characterize the per-<br>
ceptually picked-out instance of <i>brown</i>. Exercise of the picking-out capacity is marked by the <br>
referential application that x2, binding an attribution of brown(x2). Similarly, for cubical.181<br>
<br>
Each of the three subscripted ‘(that x)’s functions as a demonstrative-like determiner <br>
governing a variable. Each subscripted variable has been contextually assigned a referent <br><br>

180 At the beginning of this section, I mentioned as examples of tropes not only instances of feature-like prop-<br>
erties, but instances of relations. I lean toward accepting relation tropes from a metaphysical standpoint. I think <br>
one should distinguish a spatial distance relation as a type from the instance of that type’s holding between two <br>
particular bodies at given time. I believe, however, that any such <i>relation-</i>instances are not perceived. They do not <br>
figure in relevant causal chains to perception, as feature-like tropes do. This point applies at least to spatial and <br>
temporal relations, and several other relations attributed in perception.<br>
181 I will soon distinguish between the way in which feature-like properties are attributed to their instances <br>
and the way in which those properties are attributed to a body, or other bearer, that purportedly has the <br>
properties.</div>
