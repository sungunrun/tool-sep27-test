regis tra tion (or between representational mind and mere sensing).65 One must look at <br>
what the science counts as perceptual. One must reflect on cases to understand better what <br>
it is to be a <i>perceptual</i> constancy. A certain kind of invariance is a natural kind that marks <br>
perception and grounds taking perceptual states to have veridicality conditions. But I think <br>
perceptual is a primitive notion. One understands it by understanding cases, and by <br>
understanding objectification, not by knowing a definition.<br>
<br>
Distance constancies fit the characterization blocked off above. Fitting the char ac ter iza-<br>
tion does not in itself make them perceptual constancies, as I have stressed. The second <br>
point that Ganson <i>et</i> <i>al</i>. make to support the mistaken idea that there are no perceptual <br>
constancies for distance is thus not in dispute. It cannot itself support the claim that the <br>
invariance involved in perceptual attribution of distance is not a perceptual constancy.<br>
<br>
Elaborating this second point, Ganson <i>et</i> <i>al</i>. hold that although the perceived lightness <br>
of a surface remains stable through a wide range of changes in the shape of that surface, <br>
this stability itself is ‘not a matter of lightness constancy’. They note that in lightness con-<br>
stancy the visual system separates differences in luminance that derive from differences in <br>
illumination from differences in luminance that derive from differences in surface re flect-<br>
ance. They think that the problem with recognizing distance constancy as a perceptual <br>
constancy is ‘that there is nothing analogous to luminance in the case of the proximal <br>
stimulus for distance perception’.<br>
<br>
It is not clear how to generalize the point about the luminance case. In all invariances, <br>
perceptual and non-perceptual, some factors are filtered, separated out, from constant fac-<br>
tors. So the term ‘analogous’ must hide assumptions about constancy mechanisms. Do <br>
perceptual shape constancies that depend on templates for comparing irregular shapes at <br>
different rotational orientations count as “analogous” to the separation of lightness from <br>
illumination? How are they analogous? Are such mechanisms for shape constancy analo-<br>
gous because shape and orientation (or rather proximal stimuli caused by these attributes) <br>
are separated? In distance constancy, distance is separated from shape (or size or surface <br>
texture), and size aspects of the retinal image. Perhaps it is not separated in “the way” <br>
illumination and reflectance are separated. But then, in some shape constancy mech an-<br>
isms, shape is not separated from other properties in anything like the way illumination <br>
and reflectance are separated in light constancy. The assumptions that underlie the claim <br>
that distance constancy is not a perceptual constancy are never made clear.<br>
<br>
More fundamentally, no reason is given for thinking that all perceptual constancies must <br>
conform to whatever model lightness constancy is supposed to exemplify. Nor do the <br>
authors show that their conception—whatever it is—is embedded in perceptual psychology.<br>
<br>
Distance constancy has been studied in psychology from at least the 1930s. The con-<br>
stancy has been <i>called</i> ‘distance constancy’ for over sixty years. The science clearly takes it <br>
to be a <i>perceptual</i> constancy.66 Similarly, location constancy—also called ‘location invariance’, <br><br>
