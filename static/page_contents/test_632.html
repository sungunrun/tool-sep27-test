632 Perceptual Learning, Anticipation, Imagining</div>
<br><br>
perceptual system function to anticipate perception throughout the perceptual process. In <br>
this sense, anticipation is integral to all perception. Perceptual settings function to speed <br>
computation, to set priors for perceptual estimates, and, indirectly, to improve accuracy, in <br>
the perceptual process—from V1 to higher visual areas. Such anticipation is not even rep-<br>
resentation of the future, much less supra-perceptual.<br>
<br>
Even when anticipatory representation of the future is distinguished from states that <br>
function to anticipate the future, talk of expectation, prediction, and foreknowledge tends <br>
to obscure another important distinction. ‘Expectation’ is perhaps unspecific as to psycho-<br>
logical level. Its use, however, naturally suggests expectation that is normally taken to have <br>
propositional structure: I expect the number of lions in Africa to continue to decline. <br>
‘Prediction’ suggests propositionality more strongly, in its root, ‘diction’. Prediction is <br>
something human forecasters engage in. Perceptual-level representation of what is antici-<br>
pated from operations as simple as priming and associative learning, together with per-<br>
ceptual memory and perception-formation, has no such standing. What is common <br>
between prediction and perceptual anticipatory representation is representation of a <br>
future situation, where the representation can be veridical or non-veridical. They are, <br>
however, different psychological kinds. Differences are easily obscured by talk of predic-<br>
tion. A prediction that fits into a system of reasons and propositional inference differs <br>
profoundly from a perceptual anticipatory representation. In fact, no differences are more <br>
important for understanding psychological kinds. I think it obvious that the states dis-<br>
cussed here are not any kind of knowledge, including foreknowledge.<br>
<br>
Perceptual anticipatory representations do use perceptual attributives in iconic format. They <br>
represent attributes in a way that functions to perceptually anticipate the attribute-instances.<br>
<br>
Schematic anticipatory representations are analogs of generic, schematic memories. <br>
Recall that such memories represent types, and have lost reference to past-perceived par-<br>
ticulars. They have lost anaphoric or fallible tracking connection to references in past per-<br>
ceptions from which the memories derive. The memories are accurate or inaccurate <i>of</i> <br>
particulars that have been perceived, but are not accurate or inaccurate. Analogs sche-<br>
matically anticipate particulars of indicated attribute-types. They can be accurate <i>of</i> future <br>
perceived particulars that satisfy the attributives. The states mark only generic anticipation <br>
of perceived particulars of specific types:<br><br>
Anticipation: (that x)F(x).<br><br>
More interestingly, some anticipatory representations retain referential applications to <br>
specific particulars that have been perceived and remembered, and that attribute temporal <br>
intervals from the present at which typed particulars are anticipated.<br>
<br>
In the lion–impala case, the lion has seen a particular impala and tracked it behind a <br>
barrier. The lion anticipates that particular body’s emergence from behind the trees at a <br>
specific place within a specific time interval. Here is a simplified rendering of the repre-<br>
sentational content:<br><br>
Anticipation: (here-cego xp)(nowego xt)(that x1)(that x2)<br>
[impala-shapeb9(c)(x1), impala-shapeb9(i)(x2), impala-bodyi9(i)(x1), LocL2(c)(x1, xp, (t + xt))].998<br><br>
