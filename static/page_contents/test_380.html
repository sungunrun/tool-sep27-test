of 3-D volume shape and of 3-D spatial relations among surfaces are formed without help <br>
from attention, memory, or concepts. As we shall see, visual categorization of objects—for <br>
example generic bodies and bodies grouped by relatively specific 3-D volume shapes—can <br>
also occur very fast, under very brief exposures, in the absence of memory or concepts, <br>
and without help from attention.<br><br>

<b>Change Detection<br><br>
</div>
</b>I turn to the line of thought that took change detection to show that perception represents <br>
a severely limited range of properties.<br>
<br>
The experiments that reveal failures in change detection frequently test a subject’s per-<br>
form ance over exposure times that span saccades (over 330 ms). In these cases, per form-<br>
ance commonly involves scanning and depends on perceptual memory, as well as <br>
perception.<br>
<br>
Dominant interpretations of change-detection failures initially claimed that individuals <br>
do not see the entities that undergo change. Possibly, in some experiments, some features <br>
that undergo change are—in the first 100 ms of exposure—never perceptually represented <br>
in relevantly specific ways. However, most of the exposure times in change-detection <br>
experiments are longer.406 There is evidence that items that undergo relevant changes <i>are</i> <br>
visually perceived. This evidence derives from experimental methods that are more sensi-<br>
tive than asking for subjects’ immediate reports. The evidence shows that pre-change situ-<br>
ations are perceived and retained in memory even by subjects who fail to report awareness <br>
of the changes. Even <i>changes</i>—not simply differences from pre-change conditions—are <br>
detected.407<br>
<br>
Failures in change detection do not show something fundamental about what is per-<br>
ceived, or perceptually remembered from a given perception. They derive from failure of <br>
integration of earlier with later perception so as to allow a consciously accessible represen-<br>
tation of a change.<br><br>

<b>Cont FN</b>406 It seems extremely probable that many items whose change is not detected are not only perceived before <br>
the change, but are perceived with phenomenal consciousness. This point is especially clear when the changes <br>
that are not detected occur slowly in a single viewed scene. For discussion, see N. Block, ‘Consciousness and <br>
