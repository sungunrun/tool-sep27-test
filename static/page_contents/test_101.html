visual teMporal perceptual constancies 101</div>
<br><br>
capacities already present in pre-perceptual information registration. They are harnessed <br>
to perceptual constancies achieved through objectification of other attributes—attributes <br>
whose instances are perceived, unlike moments and instances of temporal relations. What <br>
perception adds to antecedent timing skills is a <i>specific</i> set of attributions (selecting from <br>
among the many attributes that are non-perceptually informationally registered) and an <br>
objective significance in <i>representation</i>, not just in biological function.<br>
<br>
Failure to recognize these points can lead to scepticism about whether there are percep-<br>
tual constancies for temporal representation. Christopher Peacocke claims that my views <br>
about the close connection between perception and perceptual constancy do not hold in <br>
the temporal case. He claims that perceptual constancies are absent in temporal <br>
perception.106<br>
<br>
The criticism begins with a generalization about color constancies and spatial constancies:<br><br>
. . . in the spatial case, the very characterization of constancy involves either variation in <br>
<br>
three-dimensional conditions producing the same two-dimensional pattern of proximal <br>
<br>
stimulation, or else, as in the case of colour constancy, it involves multiple environmental <br>
<br>
conditions, instantiated in normal circumstances, producing the same proximal stimula-<br>
<br>
tion property, retinal colour in the visual case. Conversely, one and the same length, for <br>
<br>
example, produces many different sizes of retinal image at various distances of that length <br>
<br>
from the perceiver. The retinal image of the length also varies with the orientation of the <br>
<br>
perceiver. But neither of these kinds of variation in three-dimensional relations, nor of <br>
<br>
varying normal environmental conditions producing the proximal stimulus state, applies <br>
<br>
to the case of duration and to other temporal properties and relations.107<br><br>
Peacocke’s ‘the very characterization of constancy’ is not my characterization. (See the <br>
characterization in Chapter 2, the section Perceptual Constancy—First Mark <br>
of Representational Mind.) Nor is it standard in the science. It applies to some <br>
perceptual constancies, but not others. It does not apply well to distance constancy by con-<br>
vergence, or to depth constancy from defocus. (See this chapter, the section Two <br>
Misguided Ways of Thinking About Perceptual Constancies; and <br>
Chapter 7, the section MiniMalisM: Defocus and Color Constancy.) It does <br>
not apply to some temporal constancies for temporal order or for temporal cycles. Distance <br>
constancy by convergence, ordinal depth constancy from defocus,108 and these temporal <br>
constancies are all framework constancies. They are derivative in the sense just discussed. <br>
They are constancies for attributes whose instances are not perceived. I do not think that <br>
all temporal constancies fail Peacocke’s characterization of constancy. In fact, as we shall <br>
see, duration constancy does not. However, some do.<br>
<br>
All constancies that I know of satisfy my characterization of perceptual constancy, <br>
which is nothing more than a slight regimentation of standard scientific characterizations. <br>
To flesh out the characterization for distance constancy:<br><br>
