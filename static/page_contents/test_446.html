446 Primitive Attribution of Causation, Agency</div>

that a very wide range of attribute categories are attributed in perception. I think that <br>
the currently known list of perceptual attributives is, however, almost surely not complete.<br>
<br>
In the next sections, I discuss attributives for causation and agency. I think that both are <br>
likely to turn out to have perceptual versions. There are also live candidates for other func-<br>
tional attributes. For example, there are probably perceptual attributives for <i>predator</i>, <br>
<i>mate</i>, <i>nest</i>, <i>food</i>.<br>
<br>
My focus here has been methodological. I have stressed three points. First, the issue <br>
must be settled, for individual candidate cases, on the basis of experimentation and <br>
the or iz ing in perceptual psychology. Second, there is little empirical reason to think <br>
that a wide, almost limitless range of attribute-types are represented by perceptual <br>
attributives. Third, the issues are best settled not by simple criteria like adaptability, bi-<br>
stability, being subject to pop-out, or being retinotopic. They are best settled hol is tic-<br>
al ly—by determining whether an attributive capacity is well explained as being <br>
produced by a perceptual  system. (For more on relevant methodology, see the discus-<br>
sion of relevant alternatives in Chapter 3, the section Scientific Practice <br>
Demarcates Perceptual Constancies from Other Invariances and <br>
Chapter 4, the section Two Methodological Points About Natural-Kind <br>
and Functional Attributives.)<br><br>

<b>Primitive Attribution of Mechanical Causation<br><br>
</div>
</b>Knowledge of the most primitive type of representation of causation is less advanced <br>
than knowledge of the most primitive type of representation of body. Primitivity here <br>
concerns the lowest representational level at which causation is represented as such. I <br>
take perceptual representation to be lower level than propositional representation. <br>
Perceptual representation of causation would be more primitive than conceptual repre-<br>
sentation. Primitivity also concerns order of emergence in formation-processing. If <br>
there is perceptual representation of causation, it is almost surely formed earlier than <br>
any conceptual representation of causation, if both are applied in response to a visual <br>
stimulus.<br>
<br>
Psychologists dispute whether there is a perceptual attributive for <i>cause</i>. This dispute is <br>
worth understanding. The dispute displays confusions and oversights that hamper <br>
progress.<br>
<br>
I think that causation is probably attributed by human and other higher-animal visual <br>
perceptual systems. At this stage of knowledge, however, it is more important to under-<br>
stand the issues that attend this conjecture than to place weight on its truth or falsity.<br>
<br>
It is already plausible that humans can attribute causation on the basis of observation <br>
rather than inductive inference. An appreciation of causation figures in children’s early <br>
attempts to find structure in the world. These points do not show that there is a perceptual <br>
attributive for causation. They show only that the most primitive representation of caus-<br>
ation is not a product of theory.<br>
<br>
Perceptual attribution of spatial relations and motion in a spatio-temporal framework, <br>
are among the most primitive types of perceptual representation. Representation of causal <br>
relations seems an important further step toward representing the world as science repre-<br>
sents it.</div>
