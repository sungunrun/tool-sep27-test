<b>The Iconic Nature of Perception<br><br>
</div>
</b>All that art displays, painting by painting, is an imitation of natural things, but <br>
<br>
the arranging and ordering comes from the mind of the artist.<br>

Samuel Van Hoogstraten, <i>Inleyding tot de Hooge Schoole der Shilderkonst</i>, <br>

1678, quoted in Ernst van de Wetering, <i>Rembrandt: The Painter Thinking<br><br>
</i>In this chapter I discuss the iconic nature of perception. I explain what it is to be iconic <br>
and why one should take perceptual representation to be iconic. I explicate wherein the <br>
noun-phrase-like structure of perceptual and perceptual-level states is iconic. I know of <br>
no intuitively nameable contrast class for iconic representation, except non-iconic repre-<br>
sentation. <i>Conventional representation</i>, though <i>not fully arbitrary</i> conventional representa-<br>
tion, can use iconic elements, as witness languages that use picture-like symbols. I take a <br>
<i>symbol</i> to be a perceivable item with a representational function. Symbols in this sense can <br>
be iconic or non-iconic.<br>
<br>
Recall that a <i>propositional</i> structure is the structure of a declarative sentence (Chapter 2, <br>
the section Representation and Veridicality Conditions), whether or not <br>
the structure is realized in a language. Having a psychological state with propositional <br>
structure is constitutively associated, I think, with a capacity for propositional inference. <br>
(See also note 199.) I assume that the reader has an intuitive grasp of what propositional <br>
structure is. Representations with propositional structure, or that contribute to propositional <br>
structure can be iconic.295 Think of languages that use picture-like symbols, where a <br>
 picture conveys a look that is an aspect of the symbol’s meaning or representational con-<br>
tent. One could use realist pictures for all one’s words. The pictures would then express <br>
iconic concepts. The sentences would be propositional through their functions and the <br>
uses of the underlying capacities. Recall that <i>concepts</i> are ability-general representations <br>
that constitutively function to contribute to a propositional structure (Chapter 2, the <br>
 section The Three Fundamental Representational Constituents in <br>
Perceptual States). Concepts that conceptualize perceptual attributives, and hence <br>
operate in propos itional structures, are iconic. (Recall the explication of ‘conceptualization’ <br>
in Chapter 6, the section Perceptual Contents, Propositions, and Noun <br>
Phrases.) One could express that dog is to the left of that cat, by showing a picture of a <br>
demonstrated dog to the left of a picture of a demonstrated cat. Propositional representa-<br>
tions and concepts expressed in <i>English</i>  are mostly non-iconic.<br>
<br>
I believe that all perceptual attributives are iconic. Even the most generic perceptual <br>
category attributives, for <i>body</i>, <i>shape</i>, or <i>color</i> are always iconic. All categorizers and all <br>
other higher-level attributives’ modes of presentation derive from those in their <br><br>

representations. See, again, note 199.</div>
