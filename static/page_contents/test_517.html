not involve acting. One can use anticipation to rehearse an act, to practice and improve. <br>
The second and third advantages usually accrue in tandem.<br>
<br>
A constant <i>random</i> source of need for correction is noise.700 The most common <i>sys-<br>
temic</i> source of need for correction is fatigue. Other systemic changes, like artificial inter-<br>
ferences and acquisition of new glasses, also demand correction in the mapping between <br>
perception and actional schemes. Mechanisms for responding to variability in per form-<br>
ance tend to correct for error.<br>
<br>
A standard way to test change in such mapping was introduced by Helmholtz.701 He <br>
asked subjects to reach for an object quickly, a task they performed easily. Then he fitted <br>
subjects with prisms and asked them to perform the same task. Initially, they failed to <br>
reach target-objects. After a few trials, their mappings between perception and action had <br>
corrected. Much of the study of movement consists of systematic refinement of <br>
Helmholtz’s method.<br>
<br>
Different strategies for remapping are optimal for different types of recalibration. For a <br>
systemic perturbation, a good strategy is to measure the error signal (the discrepancy <br>
between actual reach and successful reach) and set the remapping—in perceptual system, <br>
motor schema, or both—so that reach compensates for error on the next trial. If the per-<br>
turb ation is random, that strategy yields more errors. A better strategy is to average errors <br>
and remap to compensate for average error.<br>
<br>
Most errors derive from a combination of random and systemic factors. The agent usu-<br>
ally has no information as to whether a given error is systemic or random. So an effective <br>
remapping pattern must be responsive to the possibility of either sort of error. Given real-<br>
istic boundary conditions, human systems have been shown to respond optimally. Greater <br>
measurement uncertainty over time, corresponding to unpredictable, random variation, <br>
causes decreases in recalibration rates. Directional or asymmetric variability usually <br>
causes appropriate directional corrections. Greater variation than would be normal for <br>
random noise-variation tends to increase directional re-calibration, in accord with the <br>
probability that such variation is systemic.702 The system maintains and updates a model <br>
of variation in degrees of error, as such variation changes.703<br>
<br>
The retention spans of memories and learning are also adapted to specific types of error. <br>
Errors deriving from fatigue yield temporary remapping. Such errors are quickly forgot-<br>
ten. Errors deriving from decline in proficiency due to aging or wear-and-tear yield <br>
longer-term remappings. Records of such errors are maintained over longer time spans.704<br>
<br>
In actions of many higher animals, there is often time to monitor and improve the <br>
action as it proceeds. The point applies even to acts like reaching for an object at normal <br>
speeds. Between issuing a motor command and completing an act, there is time for <br><br>
