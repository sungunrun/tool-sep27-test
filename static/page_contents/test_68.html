68 perceptual constancy</div>
<br><br>
what particulars are perceived on a given occasion—are delimited by general, repeatable <br>
perceptual abilities or competencies. These just <i>are</i> perceptual attributives. The competen-<br>
cies, hence attributives, are fixed by long-term patterns of interaction with the environment.<br>
<br>
There are many possible <i>representata</i> for a perceptual system that accord with a per-<br>
ceiver’s behavior. Various non-natural disjunctive patterns of light arrays are consistently <br>
linked with such behavior. Or, instead of regarding perceptual systems as representing <br>
surfaces and bodies, one could regard them as representing aggregates of atoms and mol-<br>
ecules specified in ways that involve their micro-structure. Or one could take the system <br>
to represent a light pattern located just off the surface that one intuitively takes the system <br>
to represent. Each putative <i>representatum</i> is consistent with the visual system’s behavior, if <br>
behavior is described in a sufficiently abstract way.<br>
<br>
Such <i>representata-</i>candidates are not taken seriously in scientific explanation. The rea-<br>
son is that <i>representata</i> are assumed to be entities that are referred to in broader scientific <br>
accounts of the organism’s activities and needs within its environment. Ecological accounts <br>
specify attributes that are more natural for perceptual attribution as <i>representata</i> of the <br>
constancies.59<br>
<br>
As I have noted, perceptual constancies are marked by objectification. They separate <br>
aspects of proximal stimulation that are relatively proximal and local to the organism from <br>
aspects that signal environmental features that are independent of the organism’s sensory <br>
condition. This extraction of objective relevance from proximal stimulation is key to the <br>
perceptual constancies, and hence to perception itself.<br>
<br>
To summarize: Perceptual constancies are important because they mark a distinction <br>
between sensory states that are not in any ordinary sense <i>mental</i> and sensory states that <br>
have a classical feature of mind. That feature is having a nature that sets conditions for <br>
accuracy and that functions to represent aspects of the physical environment. Perceptual <br>
representation results from a specific type of objectification. The psychological system fil-<br>
ters local, idiosyncratic aspects of sensory input from aspects that have systematic rele-<br>
vance to some given aspects of the perception-independent physical environment.<br>
<br>
Let us consider in more depth what underlies the distinction between <i>perceptual</i> con-<br>
stancies and other “constancies” or <i>invariances</i>, also assumed in the science, that mark <br>
non-perceptual sensory registration. By reflecting on the science, I hope to illumine the <br>
type of objectification specific to perceptual constancies. I hope to illumine the relations <br>
that these two notions bear to the notion of perception, in contrast to non-perceptual <br>
sensing, and the notion of representation, in the sense associated with veridicality.<br>
<br>
Perceptual constancies are specifiable in terms of the attribute or particular that is the <br>
same or approximately the same, through variations in stimulus conditions. Attributes <br>
come at various levels of specificity. For example, under a variety of illuminations and <br>
spatial arrangements, a system may be much better at determining that a flower is yellow, <br>
within some limited spectrum of shades of yellow, than it is at determining that the flower <br>
is a specific shade of yellow. The animal may not need to determine exact sameness of <br>
shade to meet its needs.<br>
<br>
A color constancy can center on a limited spectrum of shades of yellow. That spectrum <br>
is a type of yellow—a limited spectrum of yellow. A broader, somewhat weaker constancy <br><br>
