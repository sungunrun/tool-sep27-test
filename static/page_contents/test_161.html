relations. There were, of course, disputes over what the privileged kind-types are. I ignore <br>
this aspect of the dispute. I assume that there are bodies; masses of particulate matter, such <br>
as gases or masses of dust particles; masses of stuff, such as sand piles; surfaces; events. The <br>
disputed category was (3) tropes—instances of (2a) feature-types and instances of (2b) <br>
relation-types.<br>
<br>
Those who supported only categories (1) and (2) appealed to ontological parsimony. <br>
They also mocked tropes as analogous to raisins or nuts stuck in a fruitcake, masquerad-<br>
ing as properties of the fruitcake. Those who supported all three categories argued that <br>
they need to be postulated to solve various problems or explain various phenomena.<br>
<br>
I ignore the mockery. I think that the ontological-metaphysical dispute is no longer <br>
interesting; I think it defunct. I think it clear that there are concrete trope-conditions <br>
localized in physical bodies. Physical science recognizes such conditions. I believe that in <br>
many cases of tropes, one can specify the occurrent physical condition of an object—its <br>
color, shape, size—that is the trope. The different occurrent conditions have different <br>
causes and different effects. I discuss the issue in connection with the semantics of percep-<br>
tion. The issue for understanding perception is whether instances of feature-like property-<br>
types help ground explanation. They do.<br>
<br>
One of the central battlegrounds on which the old metaphysical issue was fought was <br>
perception. I think that the more liberal, three-category view is correct, and relevant to <br>
understanding the representational form of perception. I think that tropes—feature-like <br>
property-instances—are perceived, indeed always perceived, when anything is perceived. <br>
This view can seem intuitively obvious. One sees the color, not just the body that has a <br>
color. One sees the shape, not just the body that has the shape. I believe that the intuitions <br>
are right and have some force. But one might think that the intuitions must conflate <br>
what is attributed with what is perceived. I think that, in this case, this thought would <br>
be mistaken.<br>
<br>
I raise three overlapping considerations: reflection on causal relations in perception; <br>
reflection on special cases of perception that bring out vividly something ubiquitous in <br>
perception; and reflection on the semantics of perceptual representation in relation to <br>
 certain distinctions in our understanding of propositional attitudes, like belief.<br>
<br>
First, let us reflect on causal chains that make perception of particulars possible. The <br>
occurrent causal chains that link the environment to the perceptual system, and to which <br>
explanation of perception of particulars must appeal, are different for color and shape. <br>
There is evidence that different aspects of perceptual systems (sometimes correlating with <br>
different areas of the brain) respond to these different causal patterns differently—even <br>
independently of one another. The color of a body has a different effect on the perceptual <br>
system than the shape. They have different effects even if one focuses on color and shape <br>
only on the same part of a body.<br>
<br>
An anti-trope view that insists that no property-instances are perceived, or perceptually <br>
referred to, must hold that nothing <i>particular</i> in a bearer (say, a body) of these properties <br>
sets these different causal chains in motion. Nothing particular in the retinal image that <br>
strikes the retinal receptors is caused by anything but the whole body. It must say that the <br>
body in its color aspect causes the color effects in a perceptual system, and the body in its <br>
shape aspect causes the shape effects. These “aspects” are supposed to be purely general, <br>
repeatable attributes of the body. I think that the denial that anything particular in the <br>
bearer of the properties sets these different causal chains in motion is clearly false. There </div>
