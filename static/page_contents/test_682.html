as Pylyshyn and Fodor were, judgment about conscious experience is only one eviden-<br>
tial factor.<br>
<br>
A focus on conscious experience in philosophy often links with a tendency to think of <br>
the products of the visual system as foreign to intuition or common sense.1116 Vision sci-<br>
ence takes ordinary judgments as part of its evidence. The science often illumines and <br>
parses common sense about conscious perception—although unconscious processing and <br>
unconscious perception are also squarely within its subject matter. Many of the <i>products</i> of <br>
the visual system—as distinct from its <i>processes</i>—are conscious. The point at which pro-<br>
cessing of sensory states yields conscious perceptual states is for empirical theory to deter-<br>
mine. Knowledge of psychological kinds derives from the science, not primarily from <br>
common sense judgments about perceptual experience.<br>
<br>
In sum, given that my aim is understanding natural psychological kinds, I focus on <br>
perceptual and perceptual-level psychological states and systems, as delineated in psy cho-<br>
logic al science, rather than on perceptual experience. Science is our best route to under-<br>
standing natural kinds. Colloquial talk of perceptual experience often blurs differences <br>
among such kinds.<br>
<br>
I believe that, at finest-grain levels of kind-demarcation, conscious representational <br>
states always differ from unconscious counterparts. They are different psychological kinds. <br>
Strictly, they have different representational contents. Even if a conscious/unconscious <br>
pair of states represents the same entities and are veridical, or not, under the same subject-<br>
matter conditions, they are different kinds. Their modes of presentation and psychological <br>
properties differ. Psychological capacities—such as speed of use—differ. Since representa-<br>
tional contents simply are basic types of psychological capacities, and since unconscious <br>
capacities probably always differ in psychologically relevant ways from conscious capaci-<br>
ties, the representational contents of conscious capacities probably always differ from <br>
those of unconscious “counterparts”.<br>
<br>
Given a focus on perception and perceptual-level capacities, and given that perception <br>
and perceptual-level capacities include conscious and unconscious states, I take questions <br>
about cognition-perception relations to cut across those about consciousness.<br>
<br>
A second framework issue is that one must distinguish perception of linguistic items, <br>
such as word tokens and sentence tokens, from non-linguistic perception. There is evidence <br>
that the system for perceiving language differs from the system for perceiving non-linguistic <br>
entities.1117 Of course, understanding the relation between perceptual and cognitive cat-<br>
egor iza tion hinges partly on understanding the role of language in cat egor iza tion. So one <br>
must keep track of the role of language in experiments that bear on perception.1118<br>
<br>
Semantic linguistic competence is certainly cognitive, at least once it reaches a min im-<br>
al ly mature stage. Understanding sentences is a propositional competence, hence <br><br>
