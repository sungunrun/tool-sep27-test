Misguided approaches to perceptual constancies 71</div>

between the sensings and what is known to be coffee. No appeal to representation of a <br>
distal stimulus would be needed in the causal explanation of formation of the sensory <br>
states themselves.<br>
<br>
Directional behavior can be explained thus: a given attractive proximal stimulus is <br>
stronger in one area of the sensory receptors than in another. So an individual could, in <br>
some cases, home in on the source of a smell by following a stronger sensory response to <br>
(say) coffee chemicals on the olfactory sensors on the right side of the individual’s recep-<br>
tors. The effects of smells that function to register food or danger can be explained simi-<br>
larly—via strength and bodily location of proximal stimuli. Of course, <i>functional</i> <br>
explanation is likely to invoke sensory relations to the distal environment. The proximal <br>
stimulus can function to lead one to the coffee. These relations need not figure in causal <br>
explanations of behavior or of sensory-state formation.<br>
<br>
A second misguided line of thinking about perceptual constancies was published as a <br>
criticism of my discussion in <i>Origins of Objectivity</i> of perceptual constancies. This line <br>
presents superficially more sophisticated reasoning. I think that it makes mistakes similar <br>
to the olfactory case. Ted Ganson <i>et al</i>. maintain that, contrary to my view, perceptual <br>
constancies are not central in demarcating the key divide between perception and sensory <br>
information registration.64 Their line goes as follows. There is no such thing as distance <br>
constancy. Yet distance perception is genuine perception. So there is perception without <br>
perceptual constancies.<br>
<br>
The claim that there is no such thing as distance constancy is certainly mistaken. <br>
Distance constancy, <i>specified</i> as ‘distance constancy’, has been a topic in the science for <br>
over sixty years.<br>
<br>
Two things are said to support the claim. The first is that distance constancy is ‘not a <br>
kind that figures in psychological explanations’. But it is obvious that representation as of <br>
distance is cited in psychological explanations. An owl’s auditory capacity to locate prey <br>
via a single auditory stimulus, or a jumping spider’s ability to jump accurately to the pos-<br>
ition of prey on the basis of a single visual input, or a human’s ability to grasp a cup on the <br>
basis of a single glance are explained in terms of perceptual representation as of the dis-<br>
tance of the prey or cup from the perceiver. This point is presumably agreed upon. So the <br>
remark must amount to the claim at issue—that distance representation in perception is <br>
not embedded in a perceptual constancy.<br>
<br>
A second thing said in support of the claim is, ‘psychologists do not posit constancy <br>
mechanisms to account for stability in perception through just any sort of change in prox-<br>
imal stimulus’. That is, not all invariances through differences in surface stimulation count <br>
as perceptual constancies. I have made this point myself—repeatedly. That is why I have <br>
frequently insisted that my characterization of perceptual constancy is not a definition, or <br>
a recipe for demarcating the difference between perception and sensory information <br><br>

Research</i> 88 (2014), 556–573. I do not discuss their undeveloped positive proposals. I note, however, that their <br>
claim that perceptual content should not be attributed to the sensory systems of animals that act on instinct, <br>
because (the authors think) perceptual content must explain “flexible” behavior, is incompatible with scientific <br>
explanation in ethology. There are detailed explanations of bee-capacities and bee-behavior that explicitly at trib-<br>
ute perceptual constancies to bees’ sensory states, even though it is plausible that bees operate almost entirely on <br>
instinct. A. Werner, R. Menzel, and C. Wehrhahn, ‘Color Constancy in the Honeybee’, <i>The Journal of Neuroscience</i> <br>
