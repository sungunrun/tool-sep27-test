132 PercePtual reference requires PercePtual attribution</div>
<br><br>
(that x1)(that x2)[F(x1)F(x2)H(x1, x2)]<br><br>
and<br><br>
(that x1)(that x2)[F(x1)G(x2)H(x1, x2)]<br><br>
are common.<br>
<br>
For example, a perception (or aspect of a perception) that represents an instance of a <br>
color shade of red would have a form read like: (that x1)(red(x1)). A perception of one <br>
body as being larger than another would have a form read like:<br><br>
(that x1)(that x2)(body(x1)body(x2)L(x1, x2))<br><br>
—that x1 body, that x2 body, x1 being larger than x2.<br>
<br>
These forms are known via reflection on the representational function and representa-<br>
tional capacities of perception. The representational function of perception is to pick out <br>
particulars. Perception picks out particulars through its occurrences’ picking them out <br>
and characterizing them. Two points bear emphasis. First, there is always at least one <br>
context-bound referential application with widest scope. Second, every context-bound <br>
referential application is also an occurrent attributional application of characterizing <br>
elem ents—perceptual attributives. Thus the dominant picking-out function is always <br>
aided by the characterizing function. Perception is never bare or neat. It is always percep-<br>
tion of something as such and such or thus and so.<br>
<br>
These points are in direct opposition to the idea, occasionally put forward, that percep-<br>
tion sometimes picks out a particular without <i>any</i> perceptual characterizing of the <br>
particular.138<br>
<br>
I think this a wildly mistaken position. I think it both conceptually incoherent and <br>
without empirical support. I think that it is apriori that it is impossible to perceive some-<br>
thing without perceiving it as being some way.<br>
<br>
What we know from empirical science is also incompatible with the mistaken position. <br>
The primary job of perceptual psychology is to explain formations of attributives—exercises <br>
of repeatable perceptual capacities that indicate properties and relations—that figure in <br>
successful or unsuccessful perception. There is no evidence from the practice of the sci-<br>
ence that perception ever occurs in the absence of such attributives. I elaborate these <br>
points in what follows.139<br><br>

<b>Cont FN</b>138 The main proponent of the view is Z. Pylyshyn, <i>Seeing and Visualizing: It’s Not What You Think</i> (Cambridge, <br>
MA: MIT Press, 2003), 180–181, 200, 202, 208–214, 217–222; Z. Pylyshyn, <i>Things and Places: How the Mind <br>
Connects to the World</i> (Cambridge, MA: MIT Press, 2007), chapter 2, especially 52. The view can also be found in <br>

<i>Philosophy and Phenomenological Research</i> 93 (2016), 25–54, who does not cite Pylyshyn or Fodor. For criticism <br>
of Pylyshyn’s claims in <i>Seeing and Visualizing</i>, see Burge, <i>Origins of Objectivity</i>, 455–456. I discuss what these <br>
authors say in favor of their view below, in the section Criticism of Two AttemPts to SuPPort <br>
Rejection of (AA1) and (AA2).<br>
139 Arguments similar to those presented here for (AA1) and (AA2) occur in Burge, ‘Five Theses on <i>De Re</i> <br>
States and Attitudes’, sections II and III; also Burge, <i>Origins of Objectivity</i>, 455–456. None of the cited authors that <br>
propose the views that I criticize shows any sign of having read previous criticisms.</div>
