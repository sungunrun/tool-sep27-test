</b>Understanding agreed-upon cases of perceptual constancy—and understanding what <br>
makes perceptual constancies <i>perceptual</i> constancies—is complicated by two facts.<br>
<br>
One is that all or nearly all sensory processing evolved to enable organisms to cope with <br>
objective features of the environment. So there tends to be something “objective” or en vir-<br>
on men tal associated even with the most primitive non-perceptual sensory mechanisms. <br>
Even in extremely simple organisms that lack perceptual constancies, stimuli are processed <br>
in ways that are tuned to environmental circumstances.<br><br>

<b>FOOTNOTES</b><br>
<b>Cont FN</b>68 Here I discuss a further paper that criticizes my handling of perceptual constancies in <i>Origins of Objectivity</i>: <br>
L. Ohlin, ‘Burge on Perception and Sensation’, <i>Synthese</i> 193 (2016), 1479–1508. This paper is seriously confused. It <br>
maintains that empirical accounts of perceptual constancies in proprioception, touch, olfaction, color vision, and <br>
visual attribution of shape are incompatible with a central view of mine. The supposed view is that <i>processes</i> in <br>
perceptual constancies must be individuated in terms of distal environmental entities (1485, 1487). In fact, I have <br>
never held this view. In <i>Origins of Objectivity</i> (359–365, 351–354), I discussed in detail constancies that are <br>
incompatible with such a view—computation of depth from statistics of convexity in registrations of contours <br>
(where the contours are individuated as present in the retinal image) and simple computations that yield light-<br>
ness constancy. There are many other examples beyond ones Ohlin cites. Indeed, the natural-scene-statistics <br>
approach that I championed in <i>Origins of Objectivity</i>, and will be championing here, regularly appeals to process-<br>
ing that centers on statistical features of states individuated in terms of the registration of the retinal image—<br>
hence, in terms of the proximal stimulus. In all of Ohlin’s examples, a distal property—or for proprioception, an <br>
extra-perceptual body-state property, is constant. The process involved in a perceptual constancy mechanism <br>
operates only on aspects of proximal stimulation. I believe that Ohlin’s confusion may stem from conflating anti-<br>
individualist constitutive explanations—which claim that <i>representational perceptual states</i> are partly individu-<br>
ated in terms of distal environmental entities—with empirical explanations that cite <i>processes</i> by which such <br>
states are formed. In any case, the main criticisms of the article are irrelevant to my actual views. I am empirically <br>
open to how perceptual constancies are produced and how perceptual state-types are formed.<br>
Although Ohlin writes that she is not defending Gibsonian anti-representationalism, she seems partial toward <br>
it, at least for proprioception and touch. She is also partial to the view that color vision lacks a subject matter. On <br>
these two points, I firmly disagree.<br>
Ohlin cites empirical work on touch and proprioception. She does not note that the work is by long-term <br>
Gibson followers. They interpret their experiments in non-representationalist terms. In my view, their experi-<br>
ments provide not the slightest ground to reject standard computational, representationalist explanations. Here is <br>
an example of how one such writer characterizes standard explanations: ‘According to [computational, represen-<br>
tationalist theory] perception is a ratiomorphic process, with constancy achieved via algorithms that couple per-<br>
cepts’: C. Pagano, ‘Dynamic Touch in Varying Media and For Proprioception’, <i>Proceedings of the Human Factors <br>
and Ergonomics Society</i> 48 (2004), 1321–1325. In two ways, this characterization is mistaken. First, not all pro-<br>
cesses “couple” percepts. A percept often results from a process that involves no preceding percepts. Second, the <br>
passage implies that if a process presents an analog of a purely physical pattern, the process is not ‘ratiomorphic’; <br>
hence the anti-representationalist has a better account. This idea assumes that standard models are narrower <br>
than they are. Some processes explained as computations of representations—like distance from convergence—<br>
can seem ‘ratiomorphic’. But explanations of many processes appeal to purely statistical relations, or to matching <br>
of physical patterns. Computation is simply idealized deterministic explanation. There is nothing essentially <br>
ratiomorphic about it. The train has long left the station on representational versus anti-representational ex plan-<br>
ations of perception. <br>
Color is a notoriously complex topic. Color constancy often tracks reflectance. It tracks other phenomena that <br>
constitute color. In <i>Origins of Objectivity</i> I remained explicitly neutral on the metaphysics of color. I do reject the <br>
idea that there is no such thing as color. I think that none of the arguments that there is nothing for color vision <br>
to represent have any force. Note, however, that if color vision failed to represent anything, it would be an im port-<br>
ant ly different kind of capacity from the perceptual capacities that exhibit perceptual constancies—capacities to <br>
represent a given <i>representatum</i> despite significant differences in proximal stimulation.</div>
