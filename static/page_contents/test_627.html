Perceptual Learning 627</div>
<br><br>
It has long been known that some learning consists in changes in receptors. Then no reten-<br>
tion from earlier sensory events is required. Often, learning derives from selective changes in <br>
processing, caused by retention of past sensing, even in low-level perceptual learning.<br>
<br>
It is clear, however, that perceptual learning occurs at perceptual levels of processing. <br>
Perceptual learning often derives from effects of perceptual memory. An example is the <br>
effect of past perception of figure–ground organization. A figure–ground relation is <br>
detected more quickly given past perceptual exposure. The effect is lost if figure and <br>
ground are reversed. Such effects can outweigh Gestalt cues.983 Another example is <br>
improvement in speed in locating a shape. Learning improves detecting shape–position <br>
relations in an array, shape–pair arrangements independent of position, and conditional <br>
prob abil ities of shape co-occurrences.<br>
<br>
Learning is evinced in saccadic eye movements and reduced reaction times. Relevant <br>
memory is unconsciously fed and stored. Conscious reports often bear little relation to <br>
learned patterns. Learning tends to override initial conscious estimates that do not accord <br>
with environmental statistics. Learning over many trials does not require feedback or <br>
attention to a specific task, but generalized application of attention to the scene may be <br>
necessary for learning.984<br>
<br>
In novel environments, over short trial-runs, feedback and attention to cue relations <br>
appear necessary for learning. In such cases, perceptual learning can occur in a single trial. <br>
The mechanism of learning these sorts of statistical associations seems to be through uncon-<br>
scious changing of the distribution of weights assigned by attention to sensory input.985<br>
<br>
There are other complimentary mechanisms of perceptual learning. In learning cues <br>
that are diagnostic for categorization, for example, memory can retain an imprint of sali-<br>
ent cues, which then figure in triggering faster categorization. Sometimes these cues may <br>
be as rich as whole shapes. Sometimes what is imprinted is a representation of a part of a <br>
shape that, under occlusion of a whole object shape, can cue presence of an object.986<br>
<br>
Learning cues figures in very specialized category <i>differentiations</i>. Distinctions among <br>
facial shapes and other familiar shape-types occurs naturally. Experts become familiar <br>
with perceivable details that enable very fine-grained distinctions among types within a <br>
category. Birds, dogs, x-ray photographs are among the more famous categories that draw <br>
expertise in spatial representation gained through differentiation.987<br><br>
