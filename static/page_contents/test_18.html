Since the science of perception aims at understanding accuracy and illusion in percep-<br>
tion, it should think systematically about the semantics of perception. Although this <br>
semantics is not nearly as rich and varied as the semantics of language and thought, it is, <br>
as we shall see, much richer and more complex than one might imagine from off-the-cuff <br>
reflection.<br>
<br>
All four key Fregean semantical notions, then, have roots in perception. Perceiving an <br>
object, or other particular, is a type of “picking out” or contextual reference. Perceiving <br>
something as being a certain way is a type of characterization or attribution. Perceiving <br>
something as having a given property from one perspective, via one kind of perceptual <br>
state—as distinct from perceiving it as having the property from another perspective, <br>
via another kind of perceptual state—just <i>is</i> attributing the property through one kind of <br>
representational content rather than another. All perceptual states can be evaluated for <br>
ac cur acy. All accurate and all inaccurate perceptual states are combinations (a) of seman-<br>
tical elements (representational capacities) whose representational function is to <i>refer</i> <br>
(to pick out), with (b) semantical elements whose representational function is to <i>attribute</i> <br>
or characterize some property, relation, or kind to what is picked out. Such combinations <br>
systematically yield an analog of logical form.<br>
<br>
These ideas are, I think, central to obtaining systematic understanding of accuracy and <br>
inaccuracy in perception. The terminology and traditions drawn on here can deepen <br>
understanding of basic aspects of perceptual psychology. They thereby deepen under-<br>
standing of perception itself, specifically its representational aspects. That is a reason why <br>
perceptual psychologists interested in understanding general features of their subject mat-<br>
ter would do well to master the technical vocabulary and ways of thinking that mark parts <br>
of this book.<br>
<br>
Although the basic notions of reference, attribution, representational content, and <br>
 representational form are all applicable to perception, there are differences between <br>
their applications to perception and their applications to language and thought. An aim <br>
of this book is to tailor application of these and other semantical notions to perception. <br>
Since the most basic forms of reference, attribution, representational content, and repre-<br>
sentational form are <i>perceptual</i>, semantical reflection on perception can illumine the roots <br>
of these notions.<br>
<br>
A corollary is that one of the deepest contributions that thinking about perception <br>
by using tools from the logical and semantical traditions can make is to clarify what it <br>
is about perception that differentiates it from thought—and vice-versa. Reflecting on <br>
 differences between the representational function and representational form of percep-<br>
tion, on one hand, and the representational function and representational form of belief, <br>
on the other, is a route into understanding differences in psychological kinds. Whereas <br>
perception shares reference and attribution with propositional thought, it utilizes these <br>
representational capacities in more limited ways. Belief is propositional. Perception is not <br>
propositional. It is nominal. Understanding the difference will, I think, help in under-<br>
standing the most basic joint in the mind—the joint between perception—and perceptual-<br>
level capacities—, on one hand, and propositional thought, on the other. The structures of <br>
perception that I discuss are not linguistic or logical. They are more basic than and prior <br>
to the structures of language and propositional thought. I think that noun-phrase struc-<br>
tures governed by contextual, referential determiners in language and thought <i>derive</i> from <br>
perception. Perception has the most basic, and evolutionarily earliest, semantics.</div>
