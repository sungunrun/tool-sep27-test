depends statistically on the exact distance between the segments and the exact directions <br>
of the segments. The orientation most closely correlated with the segments’ being on the <br>
same physical edge is lack of change in direction—colinearity at close distances and paral-<br>
lel directions at larger distances. This statistical fact reflects prevalence of roughly parallel <br>
structures in natural scenes—vines, branches, hill contours. Contrary to intuitions of <br>
Gestalt psychologists, changes of direction close to those of a parabola are more likely <br>
than those close to a circle. Human visual systems make attributions that follow very <br>
closely the exact statistics of the environment, across a wide range of environmental <br>
domains.467 Similarly, certain shapes are much more likely to be green or brown than they <br>
are to be purple or chartreuse.<br>
<br>
It is now standard in vision science to hold that categorization of objects by their shapes <br>
in the near absence of attention is a robust phenomenon. Neural investigations support <br>
this position. Information that correlates with objecthood is present in the occipital cortex <br>
at 70–80 ms post stimulus onset. Brain activity that correlates with certain perceptual cat-<br>
egor iza tions up to 260 ms is not affected by reductions in attention. Reducing attention <br>
prior to this time in perceptual processing does not affect representation of scene-gist or <br>
certain very generic categorizations, and does not depend on foveation, or apparently even <br>
covert attention. Again, antecedent sensitivity to scene statistics is thought to enable such <br>
processing without help from attention.468<br>
<br>
In retrospect, it should be no surprise that, under conditions of brief stimulus exposure <br>
and strong distraction of attention outside foveal areas, perceivers perform much better on <br>
presentations of natural scenes than artificial shapes in arbitrary color combinations. <br>
Although perception of natural scenes intuitively involves much more complex processing <br>
than perception of simple shapes and colors, natural-scenes perception relies on a richer <br>
set of contextual cues.<br>
<br>
There are no prior probabilities as to whether a rectangular bar against a black back-<br>
ground is scarlet, green, or purple. There <i>are</i> prior probabilities, largely innate and stamped <br>
into perceptual systems over eons, derived from interactions with natural scenes. Such <br>
probabilities bias processing as to whether a leaf-like shape in a tangle of branch-like <br>
shapes is green or purple. Given prior probabilities, binding shape and color under very <br>
brief perceptual exposure is likely to be superior for natural scenes than for artificial <br>
experimental set-ups.<br>
<br>
Treisman discovered conjunction errors for artificial clusters of properties in the <br>
absence or near absence of attention. Illusory conjunctions are vastly less prominent for <br>
uncrowded, well-spaced natural objects, and well-spaced, natural clusters of attributes.469 <br>
Crowding is an important factor in illusory conjunctions. For both artificial arrays and <br>
natural scenes, insufficiently spaced items outside foveal vision can induce illusory con-<br>
junctions. Reliable categorization of objects in natural scenes outside foveal areas, under <br>
short exposures and with distractors from attention, requires the objects to have some <br><br>
