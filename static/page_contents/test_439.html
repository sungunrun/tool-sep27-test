Methodology for Finding Perceptual Attributives 439</div>
<br><br>
Call ‘<i>higher-level attributives</i>’ those that must be empirically applied on the basis of <br>
other attributives—specifically perceptual attributives for shape, size, color, motion, and <br>
so on. For example, attributives for <i>body</i>, <i>face</i>, <i>dangerous</i>, <i>cause</i>, <i>act</i>, <i>knife</i>, <i>violin</i>, <i>x-ray</i> <br>
<i>machine</i>, <i>anger-expression</i>, <i>expression of anger</i>, <i>expression of evil intent</i> are higher-level <br>
attributives. Attributives for <i>body</i> and <i>face</i> are known to come in both perceptual and con-<br>
ceptual versions. There are probably perceptual and conceptual attributives for <i>dangerous</i>, <br>
<i>anger-expression</i>, <i>cause</i>, <i>act</i>. <i>Knife</i> and <i>violin</i> may be similar. <i>Expression of anger</i> is very <br>
doubtful. Almost certainly, the only attributives that indicate <i>x-ray machine</i> and <i>expression <br>
of evil intent</i> are conceptual.<br>
<br>
What all higher-level attributives have in common is that it is impossible to apply them <br>
<i>de re</i> via perception except through applications of attributives for shape, size, motion, <br>
color, and so on. They make essential use of the contents of such perceptual attributives. <br>
That is what it is to be higher-level. One simply cannot represent something, on the basis <br>
of visual perception, as a body, or a face, or an x-ray machine, or an expression of evil <br>
intent, except by perceiving certain typifying shapes as shapes.<br>
<br>
Call a lower-level attributive, or lower-level attributives, through which a higher-level <br>
attributive is applied, that higher-level attributive’s <i>application base</i>. Even if a higher-level <br>
attributive is <i>not</i>  formed in a perceptual system (as expression of evil intent is not), but <br>
has an application base in perceptual attributives, <i>perceptually based applications of that <br>
non-perceptual attributive will exhibit adaptation</i>. For adaptation of a perceptual attributive <br>
capacity that is in the application base of the non-perceptual higher-level attributive capacity <br>
will effect adaptation in the higher-level attributive’s applications insofar as those applica-<br>
tions are via perception. Application via perception of the higher-level attributive depends <br>
on a lower-level attributive in its application base. If an application base changes, percep-<br>
tual applications of higher-level attributives change with it. If one application base is <br>
replaced with another through adaptation, then the range of higher-level attributives <br>
linked in indicating an attribute, <i>whether or not it is itself produced by the perceptual sys-<br>
tem</i>, will be applied through attributives in the new, shifted application base.<br>
<br>
For example, consider a belief that1 face with that2 spatial configuration C expresses <br>
anger and that3 face with that4 spatial configuration C΄ expresses an evil intention. All <br>
attributives in the belief—face, spatial configuration C, spatial configuration C΄, expresses <br>
anger, and expresses an evil intention—are conceptual. They function to contribute to a <br>
propositional structure. I assume that the specific concepts for <i>face</i>, spatial configuration <br>
<i>C</i>, and <i>spatial configuration C</i>΄ are conceptualizations of perceptual attributives. That is, <br>
they rely on the modes of presentation and indicants of the perceptual attributives in a <br>
perceptual state from which the belief is formed; and they function to do so in a prop os-<br>
ition al network. (See explanation of conceptualization in Chapter 6, the section <br>
Perceptual Contents, Propositions, and Noun Phrases.)559<br>
<br>
I assume that <i>anger</i>, an internal state, is not attributed by any perceptual attributive. I <br>
think that individuals never literally see instances of <i>anger</i>, as distinguished from instances <br><br>

<b>FOOTNOTES</b><br>
<b>Cont FN</b>559 Concepts can have visual modality (and other modalities), can be iconic, and can be as specific as any <br>
specific perceptual attributive. There is no level of perceptual grain too specific to be utilized in reasoning. These <br>
assumptions are entailed by the very idea of a conceptualization. See note 353 and Chapter 9, the sections <br>

and Relations Between Iconic Format and Representational Content.</div>
