learning. The discussion also grounds later reflection on notions of cognition and prop os-<br>
ition al/conceptual representation.<br>
<br>
As noted, the receptive fields of neurons in V1 and V2 are small, at least in the first 50 <br>
ms after stimulus onset. A neuron’s first responses are to local areas of the retinal image. <br>
Absent special conditions, neurons register sharp changes in light intensity along a short <br>
line—edges, blobs, and bars. No retinal contour is registered at this stage. As discussed in <br>
Chapter 3, the section Retinal Image Contour Registration and Surface <br>
Contour Perception, <i>contour integration</i> constructs registrations of line segments in <br>
the retinal image from these first registrations.<br>
<br>
In the last two decades, it has been found that V1 and V2 neural receptive fields are re-<br>
tuned from their initial states, by feedback from further along in the anatomical hierarchy. <br>
Usually, the re-tuning enables neurons to respond to larger areas of visual input. Then, <br>
these lower visual areas can support more complex, more “sophisticated” processing, on <br>
the rebound.<br>
<br>
Re-tuning can result from learning or from applications of endogenous attention, <i>before</i> <br>
processing begins. When re-tuning occurs <i>during</i> a processing sequence, it takes two <br>
broad forms. One derives from endogenous attention, usually task oriented, often sup-<br>
ported in the parietal or pre-frontal areas and having its main effect at 150–220 ms after <br>
stimulus onset. The other derives from feedback from occipital visual areas, such as V4, <br>
that are anatomically higher than V1. This latter feedback is part of recurrent processing <br>
and takes effect 57–100 ms after stimulus onset. (See notes 494–495.) V1’s first-pass work <br>
is to register ultra-local patterns in the retinal image. The two types of re-tunings allow V1 <br>
to become more global, even perceptual, in its contributions to processing.<br>
<br>
Temporally late feedback to areas of visual processing like V1 and V2 is often described <br>
as modulations of sensory responses in “early visual areas”. These areas are early in that <br>
they are among the first areas that are specialized for vision to be affected by initial retinal <br>
signals. I have been calling them “<i>anatomically early areas</i>”. When these areas’ responses <br>
are modulated by feedback from anatomically later areas (like the pre-frontal cortex), the <br>
events in none of these areas are “early”. And although re-tuning of V1 from V4 occurs <br>
earlier than re-tuning from the parietal areas, it occurs only after the initial signal reaches <br>
V4. So a given area can contribute both earlier and later in a processing sequence.<br>
<br>
In feed-forward processing, abstracting from attentional and learning effects that occur <br>
<i>prior</i> to retinal stimulation, environmental contour integration is first supported in V4 at <br>
around 40–60 ms by a dominantly feed-forward process. V4 initiates feedback to V1 and <br>
contributes to contour integration in V1 slightly thereafter. (See notes 494–495.) <br>
Contributions of V1 to contour integration, either via attentional feedback or automatic <br>
feedback from V4, refine and amplify first-pass contour integration in V4. Such refinements <br>
and amplifications are important in complex, cluttered natural scenes. They help eliminate <br>
visual indeterminacies.518 (See Chapter 3, the section Retinal Image Contour <br>
Registration and Surface Contour Perception.)<br><br>
