I also want to understand relations between perception and closely, almost inevitably <br>
associated capacities—perceptual attention, primitive perceptually guided action, per-<br>
ceptual memory, perceptual anticipation, perceptual imagining, perceptual learning. <br>
I argue later that these capacities participate, with perception, in a psychological system <br>
all of whose capacities share representational form and representational content with <br>
 perception itself.<br>
<br>
Philosophy is fortunate to be able to reflect on science. A science of perception, particu-<br>
larly vision science, has bloomed into a rigorous enterprise over the last fifty years. It is by <br>
far the most impressive psychological science. It is more advanced in mathematization, <br>
and in predictive and explanatory power than many biological sciences. Especially in the <br>
second half of the book, I make extensive use of what is known from this science. Doing <br>
so is part of gaining a <i>philosophical</i> understanding of issues attaching to perception and <br>
perceptual-level representation.<br>
<br>
Such understanding is inevitably affected by scientific change. A lot of detail that I dis-<br>
cuss will turn out to be mistaken and superceded. Some of it is probably already known by <br>
someone to be mistaken. The science is so vast that no account can keep up with every <br>
relevant discovery. At worst, my use of empirical work is a challenge to do better.<br>
<br>
Some of my most general points are, I think, safe. The referential-attributional structure <br>
of perception, its iconic format, and the distinction between perceptual-level representa-<br>
tion and propositional representation, for example, will weather changes in the science, <br>
such as details of timing, of what perceptual-level attributives there are, and so on.<br>
<br>
I focus on vision. I discuss hearing, touch, proprioception—the other main human per-<br>
ceptual senses—only occasionally. This approach inevitably evokes complaints, especially <br>
from those interested in other types of perception, and in relations between perceptual <br>
modalities.<br>
<br>
Several answers to such complaints seem to me apropos. First, understanding visual <br>
perception is a huge task. Vision is the most complex of the senses. I plead human limita-<br>
tion. I invite others to do similar work on other types of sense perception.<br>
<br>
Second, vastly more is known about vision than about other types of perception. The <br>
number of vision scientists and the amount of work done in visual psychology dwarfs the <br>
number and amount in all the sciences about other perceptual modalities put together.<br>
<br>
Third, vision is by far the most important sense for most humans and apes for guiding <br>
their lives. It is the main basis for the development of empirical science by human beings. <br>
Although I think it important to remember that human perception presents only one <br>
suite of capacities, and understanding perception in other animals is of great importance, <br>
I focus on humans because I am interested in situating perception in relation to higher <br>
representational powers. As far as is known, only humans have some of these higher <br>
 powers—linguistically expressed thought, reflective deliberation, and scientific reasoning, <br>
for example.<br>
<br>
Fourth, many visual capacities have definite analogs in other perceptual modalities. So <br>
understanding vision can provide a boost in understanding them. The sciences of hearing <br>
and touch derive much of their success from using ideas and methods that come from <br>
vision science.<br>
<br>
Fifth, many of the most basic features of visual perception—its most basic representa-<br>
tional structure and its iconic format, for example—are present and basic in the other <br>
perceptual senses.</div>
