signals via PHC and OFC seem to have their effects in IT by 130 ms after stimulus onset,537 <br>
slightly later than the initial generic categorizations supported in IT. These signals carry <br>
scene-context information that enhances the first, at-a-glance categorizations supported <br>
in IT—categorizations that are initially independent of enhancement from gist or scene-<br>
context. Enhancement is mutual. Categorization can improve gist representation as well as <br>
vice-versa.<br>
<br>
Specific categorizations are quicker and more accurate if an object is in a familiar spatial <br>
scene-context. A human-shaped human-body in a kitchen is categorized quicker than a <br>
pig-body in a kitchen. Isolated objects, not embedded in a scene are processed faster than <br>
embedded objects. Of course, in natural vision, such isolation is rare.538<br>
<br>
Here again, there are successive phases of activation. First responses in IT correlate with <br>
low-frequency information in the scene’s spatial layout. So both the first ventral pathway <br>
signals and the first dorsal pathway signals carry low frequency spatial information. A <br>
second phase of activation, providing higher-frequency information for the scene repre-<br>
sentation, begins to develop around 230 ms, peaking at 250–300 ms. These activities again <br>
feed back to IT-based categorization. Contextual scene information, or gist information, <br>
does not make initial categorizations faster, if the perceived object is clearly set off. Nor is <br>
it necessary for categorization. In complex layouts, common in natural scenes, represent-<br>
ing familiar spatial context for an object speeds and improves accuracy for relatively spe-<br>
cific types of categorization.539<br>
<br>
An analog of spatial-context feedback is feedback of semantic context from frontal to <br>
temporal areas for word perception. This feedback is slightly slower than that of <br>
scene-context.540<br><br>

<b>Levels of Specificity in Perceptual Categorization<br><br>
</div>
</b>Heuristically, I distinguish five levels of abstraction in perceptual categorization. The levels <br>
are not set in stone. Sometimes, there is no neat way to apply them. However, they have a <br>
fairly broad application.<br><br>
