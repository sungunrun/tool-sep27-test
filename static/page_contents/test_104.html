certain circumstances are systematically non-veridical is completely consistent with per-<br>
ceptual  constancy. More importantly, the premise that the Kappa effect does not fit the <br>
model of temporal perception as involving perceptual constancy is mistaken. The article <br>
that Peacocke cites was written before the nature and limitations of the Kappa effect were <br>
discovered.<br>
<br>
It has been known for some time that there are many context-effects beyond the one <br>
that Peacocke cites. Absent compensating cues, perceptual attribution of duration can <br>
vary with several parameters beyond spatial separation of the events: speed, temporal fre-<br>
quency of the events, the number of events in an interval, the size of the perceived entities, <br>
sensory adaptation, and so on.110 For example, the perceived duration of a motion has a <br>
tendency to dilate with increasing speed or temporal frequency.111 It has become apparent, <br>
however, that these effects are largely due to insufficient cues in the situations (including <br>
the experiments) in which they occur. In natural-scene circumstances, the effects are <br>
canceled or greatly mitigated. Of course, perceptual constancies cannot track properties if <br>
the perceiver lacks the cues needed to do so.<br>
<br>
The effects are predictable from retinal effects of viewed distal changes. For example, <br>
smaller retinal effect of a distant object would enlarge the apparent length of the path that <br>
it follows, hence an increase in the time that it appears to take in following it.112 If there <br>
were never any compensation in the psychology for differences between distal facts and <br>
proximal retinal effects of them, it would be natural to think that relevant sensing is non-<br>
perceptual. Motion and other changes are viewed in a world in which it is valuable for <br>
perceivers to compensate for perspectival effects. The danger of a perceived motion does <br>
not decrease smoothly with the distance of the motion from the perceiver. It is natural to <br>
ask whether there are compensating cues and mechanisms that can reduce or cancel out <br>
the deficiencies (functional or representational) that would otherwise occur if an individ-<br>
ual were relying entirely on the temporal effects on proximal stimulation to sense tem-<br>
poral duration. In fact, there are.<br>
<br>
Although compensation is never perfect, mechanisms have been discovered that com-<br>
pensate for distortions that would occur if the system relied purely on timing of retinal <br>
changes to map timing of viewed events. The perceived duration of perceived events is <br>
largely unaffected by changes in their distance from the perceiver, and from one another, <br>
and hence by their proximal effects on the retina, if information about the viewing dis-<br>
tance is available. The distortions occur when cues for distance are absent. Here perceptual <br>
attribution of temporal intervals is coordinated with perceptual constancy for other at trib-<br>
utes besides temporal interval, in this case size, and distance of perceived motion. The <br><br>
