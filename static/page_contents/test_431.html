The mechanics of categorization are not well understood. Shape and size are known to <br>
be primary cues for most visual categorizations. Superordinate categories like <i>animal-body</i> <br>
and <i>edible body</i> can have instances with very differently shaped bodies. It is a formidable <br>
empirical problem to understand how such differently shaped instances are visually <br>
assimilated under one category.<br><br>

<b>Perceptual Constancies in Categorization Processing<br><br>
</div>
</b>The constancies that underlie the heart of mammalian perception—categorization—are <br>
those for depth, primarily through binocular disparity, and for size, surface-shape, 3-D <br>
volume shape, orientation, and spatial position. By timing neural firing patterns that are <br>
similar across significant differences in retinal stimulation, holding other factors constant, <br>
science can support judging when spatial perceptual constancies first emerge in a sequence <br>
of visual processing. The listed constancies help mark the advent of perception and repre-<br>
sentational mind, as distinct from information registration.<br>
<br>
Spatial perceptual constancies are keys to categorization. An instance of a category, <br>
such as a face or animal, cannot be expected to appear in a canonical pose in a natural <br>
scene. One might see a face or an animal at any of many distances and angles. So to be <br>
useful to a perceiver, categorization must be tolerant of various distances, hence sizes of <br>
retinal stimuli, and of view-angles, from either changes in viewer position or of move-<br>
ments of the object itself. Such differences are plotted in the iconic spatial framework.<br>
<br>
Invariances in neural patterns that correlate with size, shape, and position that are tol-<br>
erant of different retinal stimuli that derive either from differences in the viewer’s position <br>
or from differences orientations of an object, appear in the infero-temporal cortex (IT) at <br>
60–80 ms, hitting peak at 80–100 ms, from stimulus onset. These constancies derive from <br>
V4, and probably from MT in later stages of its activity. These constancies support earliest <br>
categorizations. Strength of constancy depends partly on familiarity with shapes, either via <br>
learning history or via innate settings.548<br>
<br>
Timings of invariance of neural patterns over large differences in proximal stimulation <br>
yield a basis for informed conjecture about timings of perceptual attributions and forma-<br>
tion of perceptual constancies. Timing methods may still be too crude to discern earliest <br>
formations of relevant neural patterns. Until there is more detailed understanding of the <br><br>

<b>FOOTNOTES</b><br>
<b>Cont FN</b>548 Timings of constancies listed in the preceding paragraph are for IT. Retinal signals reach V4 by 58 ms. As <br>
noted earlier, elementary spatial constancies are supported in first-pass V4. Primitive ordinal depth constancies <br>
may occur even earlier, by 25 ms, supported in V2. See Fowlkes, Martin, and Malik, ‘Local Figure-Ground Cues <br>
