tives for the functional attributives’ application bases. The application bases consist of <br>
attributives for shape, size, color, motion. These attributives represent physical characteris-<br>
tics by which functional attributes are identified. In the case of <i>edible</i>, the psy cho logic al <br>
system not only groups entities that are in fact edible by their sizes, shapes, colors, and <br>
motions. It also exhibits dispositions—principally conative dispositions—that supplement <br>
the application base. (See Chapter 12, the section Methodology for Finding <br>
Perceptual Attributives.)<br>
<br>
Suppose that this conative state is triggered by a perceptual state. There may or may not <br>
be further beliefs and intentions in the causal background. The conative state is not only <br>
caused by but partly guided by perception in the conative state’s causing an action that <br>
realizes the target.<br>
<br>
The targeting state inevitably takes some or all its representational content from percep-<br>
tion. Here the targeting state borrows visual content for the targeted body and propriocep-<br>
tual content for the hand that is to grip the body. Perception not only feeds the conative <br>
state with content, it guides that state, thence the action, to perceived targets. Usually, per-<br>
ception of the target-object remains after the conative state is formed. It guides action to <br>
its consummation.<br>
<br>
Perceptual memory and anticipation are employed if perception of the target is not <br>
ongoing, during the action. Even if perception is ongoing, short-term perceptual memory <br>
is an intermediary between perception and actional state formation, since there is always a <br>
time-lag between perception and conative response. Moreover, anticipatory representa-<br>
tion naturally results from patterns of perception, retained from previous perception. As <br>
we shall see, anticipatory representation figures prominently in guiding relatively primi-<br>
tive action.<br>
<br>
Readers unfamiliar with the psychological literature on perceptually guided action <br>
would do well to prepare themselves for a richer psychology than introspection would <br>
ever suggest. As with the formation of perception, there is a lot of fast, unconscious pro-<br>
cessing. Many more representational states are formed than one recognizes from intro-<br>
spection alone.<br>
<br>
Obviously, we are not aware of the specific motor commands that lead from target-<br>
setting conative state, via visual guidance, to a target. An intricate set of mechanisms also <br>
function to correct for errors, noise, fatigue, and abnormal perturbations of the system. <br>
Many such corrective mechanisms are representational. Almost none are available to con-<br>
sciousness. Conscious access costs energy and time. Often, relatively primitive action <br>
must be performed under narrow time constraints. As will become clear in discussion of <br>
experiments, much of the representational processing in relatively primitive action is too <br>
fast and too complex to be consciously accessible.<br>
<br>
Conative representation of a target and conative motor commands that function to <br>
reach a target are almost inevitably intermodal. Any perceptually guided action that oper-<br>
ates on the environment, as distinguished from on the agent (such as scratching oneself), <br>
combines proprioceptive perceptual guidance with guidance from some other sensory <br>
system that functions to provide information about the environment. In mammals, and <br>
certainly primates, vision is the primary perceptual capacity that represents targets and <br>
guides environmentally oriented action.<br>
<br>
I focus on an example of reaching. Active eye movement is another rich area for study-<br>
ing relatively primitive perceptually guided action. I discuss it in Chapter 15, the section </div>
