notion of singular <i>Bedeutung</i> and perception.11 Perceptual states function to refer to—or <br>
pick out—particular entities in the environment. Their attributive, or characterizing, <br>
 function is systematically associated with their referring, or picking-out, function.<br>
<br>
Frege’s technical analog of singular reference, singular <i>Bedeutung</i>, was context-free. He <br>
wanted to understand context-free names, like numerals or diagrams of geometrical fig-<br>
ures. Because of his interest in mathematics and logic, he neglected detailed reflection on <br>
context-dependent reference. His conception of how context-free singular reference com-<br>
bines with attribution can, however, be naturally extended to contextual-dependent, <br>
demonstrative-like singular reference. Reference via perceiving something, which depends <br>
on causal relations to what it picks out, depends on context in that it depends on occurrent <br>
stimuli to pick out anything.<br>
<br>
Philosophical and mathematical extensions of Frege’s ideas about singular denotation <br>
(<i>Bedeutung</i>) were applied mainly to context-free languages, like mathematics and pure math-<br>
ematical logic, until the 1970s. Philosophers extended Frege’s idea of context-free denotation <br>
to demonstrative uses and other context-dependent devices in language and thought.12<br>
<br>
I think that context-dependent demonstrative reference in language and thought are <br>
literal outgrowths from the referential relation between a perceptual state and perceived <br>
entity. Of course, demonstratives in language and much demonstrative-like reference in <br>
thought are applied in individuals’ <i>acts</i>. Perceptual reference is mostly not active. However, <br>
demonstrative-like reference in thought and demonstrative-like reference in perception <br>
are structurally and functionally the same. Although perception is the root of reference, <br>
understanding reference began with understanding language and thought. That under-<br>
standing can be fruitfully applied back to the root source—perception.<br>
<br>
Third, Frege’s notion of <i>sense</i>, as a way in which entities are presented to the mind, is a <br>
further semantical idea that he applied to language and thought, but that has clear applica-<br>
tions to perception.13 That notion is the antecedent of modern notions, certainly my <br>
notion, of representational content. In Chapter 2, I explain the notion of representational <br>
content in some detail. For now, think of it as a way of representing that sets, or contrib-<br>
utes to setting, conditions for accuracy or truth. Different thoughts can represent the same <br>
entity in different ways. Different kinds of perceptual states can, and commonly do, repre-<br>
sent a given particular and given attributes of the particular in different ways. Differences <br>
in “ways” constitute different kinds of psychological competence or capacity, different <br>
representational contents. Perceptual reference to a particular, and perceptual attribution <br><br>

reference in geometry, focusing on Kant’s sub-species of sensible intuition: apriori sensible intuition. Frege was <br>
aware that Kant’s other sub-species—<i>empirical</i> sensible intuition—is equivalent to sense perception. Frege <br>
understood both species to be theoretical notions that function to do the work of the common-sense notion, <br>
singular reference (or singular denotation).<br>
