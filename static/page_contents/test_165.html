through and through with <i>de re</i> representation. I think it instructive to compare <i>de re</i> <br>
representation in perception with <i>certain types</i> of <i>de re</i> representation in thought.<br>
<br>
Imagine that one looks at a brown cube in light that prevents seeing its color and its <br>
specific shape. Perhaps it is too far away to see them. Suppose that one can see enough to <br>
see the cube accurately as a body via its generic 3-D volume shape. So one’s visual system <br>
attributes generic shape and <i>body</i>, and one perceives the body <i>de re</i>. On the basis of the <br>
perception, suppose that one also <i>thinks</i> of the body <i>de re</i> as a body. Suppose that one has <br>
been told authoritatively that the body is brown and cubical. One retains (remembers) the <br>
<i>de re</i> thought of the body via a memory index-file. One forgets the dim image of the <br>
generic shape and the non-specific color or lightness. One thinks of it, <i>de re</i>, while think-<br>
ing of it as brown and cubical (and as having color, generic shape, and shape). In the con-<br>
text, one can only attribute the color-attribute-<i>types</i> and shape-attribute-<i>types</i> of the <i>de re</i> <br>
perceived and remembered body, where, of course, the body is perceived as and thought <br>
of as a body. The attributions of <i>body</i>, <i>brown</i>, <i>colored</i>, <i>cubical</i>, <i>outer-boundary-connected</i>, <br>
and <i>shaped</i> are all correct. But one did not perceive the body’s specific shape or color at all, <br>
and one carries no <i>perceptual</i> memory of color or shape at all. In the thought, one does not <br>
bear <i>de re</i> referential relations to instances of any of these properties, except the instance <br>
of <i>body</i>—the body itself.<br>
<br>
This thought exemplifies the case that the anti-trope theorist thinks holds in all <i>de re</i> <br>
perception and thought. There is a <i>de re</i> perception-like relation to a bearer—here, the <br>
body—but no such relations to tropes of color or shape attributes. The feature-like proper-<br>
ties are veridically attributed. No references to instances of them occur.<br>
<br>
Now compare the first <i>de re</i> thought to another veridical <i>de re</i> thought that applies the <br>
same attributives. This second thought comes not from a mix of perception, memory, and <br>
interlocution, but just from perception. One thinks <i>de re</i> of the body as brown and cu bic al. <br>
One does so on the basis of an unobstructed view of the body’s color and specific shape. <br>
There is clearly a representational difference. A difference lies in the directness of repre-<br>
sentational relation to the instantiated, feature-properties. The first thought does not bear <br>
a <i>de re</i> relation to the property-instances of <i>brown</i> and <i>cubical</i>. One attributes the proper-<br>
ties via hearing about the types. Perhaps one’s interlocutor attributed the properties on the <br>
basis only of theoretical inference. In the second thought, one attributes them on the basis <br>
of a <i>de re</i> relation to their instances. What is missing in the first thought is just what per-<br>
ception normally provides—direct, non-inferential (referential) representational relations <br>
to property-instances that are not purely through attribution. The second thought is <br>
directly and fully based on perception. Both it and the perception that it relies upon bear <br>
<i>de re</i> relations to instances of the properties <i>brown</i> and <i>cubical</i>—to their tropes. The point <br>
of the example is to bring out that the anti-trope account of perception misses the intui-<br>
tively important semantical difference between the first and second thoughts, and then <br>
provides an impoverished view of perception. Any thought based purely on perception <br>
will, together with the perception, bear <i>de re</i> referential relations to trope-instances.<br>
<br>
The veridicality conditions of the two thoughts are different. The difference lies in what <br>
perception <i>quite routinely</i> provides, at least when it is successful—referential relations not <br>
only to bearers of properties (“objects”), but to instances of feature-like properties, tropes. <br>
In normal perception, there is not only attribution of kind-like and feature-like properties <br>
to bearers that are perceived. There is also attribution of feature-like properties to their <br>
instances.</div>
