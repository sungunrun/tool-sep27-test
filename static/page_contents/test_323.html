Any such noun-phrase-like structure has a canonical decomposition, no less in iconic <br>
representation than in non-iconic language. The structure decomposes into its constituent <br>
referential applications and attributives. Complex attributives decompose into their con-<br>
stituents. Farther-than is almost certainly primitive. Surface (like edge) is probably also <br>
primitive. There are interesting issues here about how representations of surfaces and <br>
edges relate to representation of surface-and edge-parts, issues to which I shall return. <br>
Perceptual primitives are determined not by armchair intuitions, but by science’s discov-<br>
ery of basic perceptual competencies. Both primitives and complexes are non-arbitrary <br>
representational units.<br>
<br>
The main point is that realist paintings, maps, and perceptual states function to identify <br>
their <i>representata</i> by picking them out referentially, and characterizing them by indicating <br>
and attributing attributes. The attributives function to characterize particulars, which <br>
are picked out in an occurrence-based, contextual way. Representational units are not <br>
arbitrary. They correspond to psychological competencies.<br>
<br>
Let us return to (a)–(h), the remaining claims that Fodor infers from the false principles <br>
PP(1) and PP(2΄):<br><br>
 (a) iconic representations have no constitutive structure;<br>
<br>
 (b) constituents of iconic representations are homogeneous (‘each constituent contrib-<br>
<br>
utes in the same way’);<br>
<br>
 (c) iconic representations lack logical forms;<br>
<br>
 (d) iconic representations lack a distinction between semantic constituents that con-<br>
<br>
tribute individuals and constituents that contribute properties;<br>
<br>
 (e) iconic representations lack truth conditions;<br>
<br>
 (f) iconic representations lack ontological commitments;<br>
<br>
 (g) iconic representations do not impose principles of individuation on domains in <br>
<br>
which they are interpreted;<br>
<br>
 (h) iconic representation is not representation-as.<br><br>
Contrary to (a), (b), and (d), the constituents have constituent structure, in that they are <br>
typed as singular representations applying attributive representations. Contrary to (a), (b), <br>
and (c),348 they have the grammar-like and semantical forms of contextual determiners <br>
dominating attributives. Fodor understands (e) to mean that iconic representations lack <br>
any semantics—any veridicality conditions. Contrary to Fodor’s understanding of (e), all <br>
whole iconic representations and some consituent parts of such representations have <br>
accuracy conditions. Accuracy conditions are instances of this general scheme for pic-<br>
tures, maps, and perceptual states. As a first approximation, for core accuracy conditions:<br><br>
If every singular referential application in a given representation picks out a particular <br>
<br>
and every attributive is accurate of particulars to which they are attributed, the represen-<br>
<br>
tation is accurate. Otherwise, it is not accurate.<br><br>

<b>FOOTNOTES</b><br>
<b>Cont FN</b>348 Fodor does not explain his notion of ‘logical form’. I take logic to be an account of propositional validity <br>
by virtue of propositional structure. Pictures and perceptions are not propositional. These are merely termino-<br>
logical points. Regardless of how one uses the term ‘logical form’, there are certainly forms of pictorial and per-<br>
ceptual representation that have veridicality conditions and a semantical structure, together with an analog to <br>
a syntax.</div><div id="PGHEADER">
