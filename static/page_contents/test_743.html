the distal environment. This development is most dramatically illustrated in psy cho phys-<br>
ic al upshots of the discovery of spatiotopic mappings in the brain. (See Chapter 9, the <br>
section Iconic Aspects of Perceptual Spatial Representation.)<br>
<br>
Similarly, representations of distal attributes that were thought to require conceptual <br>
help or help from attention have been shown to be produced automatically and very fast <br>
by the visual system, because the system capitalizes on long-term interactions with pat-<br>
terns in the environment. The new insights have often come from experiment that is more <br>
closely fitted to environmental conditions, as contrasted with convenient, highly simplified <br>
laboratory conditions. We saw this development in the failure of the Marr and Treisman <br>
proposals about purely visual processing. (See Chapter 10, the sections Marr’s 2½-D <br>
Sketch and Two Lines of Empirical Criticism of Treisman’s Theory.) <br>
Both proposals took processing of representation of major environmental features to be <br>
more in need of special supplement than the processing in fact was. In both cases, the <br>
power of the environment in shaping perceptual mechanisms was underestimated, and <br>
not sufficiently probed by experiment valid in natural ecological conditions.<br>
<br>
The scientific change here involves growing theoretical recognition that many pre-<br>
perceptual and perceptual transformations use cues and formation operations not avail-<br>
able to intuitive reflection. Descartes’ postulation of convergence as a way of producing <br>
location constancy was intuitive. But many cues derive from brute statistical correlations <br>
in natural scenes. Such correlations were picked up by perceptual systems via evolution, <br>
and refined in learning. The current approach seeks statistical properties of natural scenes <br>
that might cue representation of attributes in the environment. Often, an ideal observer is <br>
postulated and an optimality theorem is proved. The theorem states the best estimates that <br>
such an observer could produce regarding a specific attribute, given known limitations of <br>
noise, acuity, and so on. Then real perceivers are tested against such limits. Computational <br>
routes to forming representation of the attribute are postulated and are themselves tested <br>
against neural and psychophysical capabilities. I discussed a case of such theorizing in <br>
Chapter 3, the section Retinal Image Contour Registration and Surface <br>
Contour Perception.1208 The approach works back from facts about the environ-<br>
ment to whether such facts are used to cue formation of perceptual representations.<br><br>
