The fact that representational contents are kinds of psychological states places strong <br>
constraints on understanding the two other basic constitutive aspects of representational <br>
contents.<br>
<br>
A second constitutive aspect of representational content is being a way of representing. <br>
This aspect is analogous to a role that Frege gave to <i>sense—</i>that of being a mode of presen-<br>
tation, a way in which things in the world are presented to a mind.30 A representational <br>
content is a perspective that functions to be a perspective on a <i>representatum</i>. As finite <br>
minds, we never perceive or think about anything—any particular, any property, any kind, <br>
any relation—except from a limited, perspective on that <i>representatum</i>.<br>
<br>
For example, we can think of the very same thing—a water molecule—in different ways. <br>
We can think of it via the concept water molecule. Or we can think of it via the concept <br>
H2O molecule or the concept molecule of the most prevalent liquid. These are different <br>
representational contents. Thinking them involves exercising different psychological com-<br>
petencies or capacities. Knowing things through thinking with the different concepts <br>
yields different knowledge.<br>
<br>
Analogous points apply to perception. One can, in different ways, perceive a surface as <br>
having the same shape. The shape can be presented from different perceptual perspectives. <br>
A rectangular surface can be presented and perceived as rectangular straight-on or from <br>
an angle. Suppose that a rectangular surface leans backwards from the fronto-parallel <br>
plane. (Every line in this plane is parallel to the line between the eyes of viewer’s eyes at the <br>
time of viewing.) The parts of the surface at its top are at greater depth, with respect to the <br>
viewer, than parts of the surface at its bottom. Then the perceptual representational con-<br>
tents of a perception of the surface and its rectangularity will be different, even though <br>
they present the same surface as a rectangular surface. There are different perceptual states <br>
with different representational contents, although they have the same object and property <br>
as perceptual <i>representata</i>. I go into much more detail on this matter in Chapter 7.<br>
<br>
Difference in mode of presentation correlates with difference in psychological states <br>
that enter into different psychological patterns and that exercise different capacities. Here <br>
the second basic aspect of representational content correlates with and is constrained by <br>
the first. Representational content as mode of presentation is relevant to the type of repre-<br>
sentational information, the type of representational perspective, that the individual has <br>
on <i>representata</i>. Difference in mode of presentation—difference in the way a <i>represen­<br>
tatum</i> is presented to the mind—is difference in type of psychological state, or compe-<br>
tence, or exercise of competence.<br>
<br>
Explanations in epistemology and explanations of perceptually guided action, as well as <br>
causal explanations in perceptual psychology, advert to the specific way that the world is <br>
presented to individuals. In perception, this “way” usually hinges on the proximal stimula-<br>
tion that led to the perceptual state. Different types of proximal stimulation can yield dif-<br>
ferent perceptual representational contents—different types of perceptual state, different <br>
modes of presentation—even of a given environmental feature.<br>
<br>
Explanations in the semantics of thought or perception that bear on an individual’s <br>
limit ed perspective on the world—the “meaning” of a representational state for the indi-<br>
vidual—hinge on the mode-of-presentation aspect of representational content. Thus an <br><br>
