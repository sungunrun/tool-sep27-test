146 PercePtual reference requires PercePtual attribution</div>
<br><br>
<i>only</i> way to pick out a particular in perception is to discriminate a cause as an instance of <br>
some property or kind that the particular in fact has. Perceiving a particular without doing <br>
so partly by way of correctly determining one or more of its natural properties—is <br>
impossible.<br>
<br>
The main argument for (AA1) articulates the discriminative competence necessary for <br>
perceptual reference to a particular. Competence to perceptually discriminate a particular <br>
includes competence to discriminate specific environmental properties, where exercise of <br>
the competence is triggered by a specific type of stimulation. The argument for (AA2) <br>
claims that successful discrimination of a particular necessarily depends on exercise of the <br>
discriminative competence.<br>
<br>
The argument for (AA2) implies a further argument for (AA1). There can be no percep-<br>
tual competence that is a competence (or that functions) to do something perceptually <br>
impossible. By the argument for (AA2), perceiving a particular without accurately attrib-<br>
uting one of its natural properties is impossible. So it is impossible for a perceptual compe-<br>
tence to be individuated by a bare that—a referential competence unaided by perceptual <br>
attributives.<br><br>

<b>General Remarks on Attributives and Perceptual Discrimination<br><br>
</div>
</b>Every perceptual attributive is a competence to perceptually discriminate instances of <br>
some type of particular with causal powers from instances of other types of particulars <br>
with causal powers. Thus every perceptual attributive makes some partition. There are no <br>
perceptual attributives, like is self-identical, that make no partition. Moreover, the parti-<br>
tions that perceptual attributives make all correspond to discriminative perceptual <br>
competencies.<br>
<br>
Of course, there are conceptual attributives that one can <i>think</i> with that one could not <br>
<i>sensorily</i> discriminate from anything else. I know that instances of berkelium are <br>
instances of an element. I could not sensorily or perceptually discriminate those <br>
instances from anything else in most scenes. The concept berkelium makes a partition. <br>
Yet having the concept is not necessarily associated with a competence to sensorily or <br>
perceptual discriminate berkelium from other entities with causal powers. I can have <br>
and apply such a concept without connecting it to perceptual discrimination because I <br>
acquire the concept through superficial reading. The reading may not describe a dis-<br>
tinct ive look or property. Still, I think thoughts expressed with the noun. I have little <br>
background characterization, much less competence to perceptually apply the concept <br>
to cases. Perceptual attributives are always associated with a discriminative perceptual <br>
competence.<br>
<br>
The connection between perceptual attributives and discrimination is not unqualified. <br>
One can sensorily discriminate more than one can <i>perceptually</i> attribute, or <i>perceptually</i> <br>
discriminate. Human visual systems can discriminate and respond differentially to the dif-<br>
ference between a single photon striking the eye and no photon striking the eye. Such dis-<br>
crimination is not perceptual. Similarly, sensory registration that discriminates an edge <br>
within a proximal stimulus is non-perceptual. Discrimination that distinguishes a cubical-<br>
shape-instance from among many other shape-instances by picking it out and character-<br>
izing it as cubical is perceptual.</div>
