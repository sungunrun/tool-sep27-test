Part–Whole Representation  335</div>
<br><br>
An analog of PP(3) applies for vision and touch. Regardless of how, exactly, one answers <br>
the delicate question, it is plausible that one depicts and sees a <i>great many</i> parts, when one <br>
depicts or sees a naturally segmented edge, surface, and so on. The smallest depicted or <br>
perceptually discernible parts are <i>very</i> small. The number of parts that we depict or see is <br>
finite, but imposing.<br>
<br>
PP(3) is not correct. I state it to illustrate the point that representation of parts operates <br>
on already segmented entities in the scene. These are what I call ‘natural units’. Arbitrary <br>
scene parts are not represented as units. Arbitrary parts of the picture are not representa-<br>
tional units. Once units like environmental edges, surfaces, shapes, and bodies are <br>
 established, pictorial representation induces a part–whole structure on entities with those <br>
attributes.<br>
<br>
There is this difference between PP(3) and any analogous principle for vision. Given <br>
that the semantics of pictures depends on user’s intentions and conventions—as well as <br>
their perceptual capacities—, it is plausible that the whole picture represents a scene as <br>
such. The concept of a scene is part of picture users’ repertoires. Use of perceptual systems <br>
does not rely on intentions and conventions. Perceptual systems may not have a percep-<br>
tual attributive for anything as large and inclusive as the whole scene that a perceiver is <br>
confronted with at any given time. I see nothing in perception, or in perceptual science, <br>
that suggests that a perceptual system sums all the perceived natural units represented in a <br>
given perception into a super-unit—the scene.<br>
<br>
We do nearly always perceive and perceptually characterize parts (or properties of <br>
parts) of the natural units that we perceive or perceptually attribute. When we see an edge <br>
or bounded surface, we normally see all the visibly discernible parts of the surface. We see <br>
them as parts. Similarly, when we touch a surface, we tend to perceive at least some sub-<br>
parts of the surface. We can map by tactile sense where those parts are in relation to other <br>
felt parts.<br>
<br>
In most cases, environmental edge segments are not perceived before or independently <br>
of edges of which they are segments. In perception the representation of molar edge, sur-<br>
face, shape, and body units is more basic than representation of the sub-parts of such <br>
units, including but not limited to the smallest sub-parts. This point requires some <br>
development.<br>
<br>
In the earliest stages of processing in the visual system, registrations of very short edge <br>
segments in the retinal image are put together to form larger edge segments. This smaller-<br>
segment to larger-segment process is pre-perceptual. By the time the system processes <br>
input sufficiently to produce perceptual representations, the system is working with repre-<br>
sentations of environmental edges (as distinguished from retinal edges), surface shapes <br>
and 3-D volume shapes, surfaces, and bodies, all oriented in 3-D space. As seen in <br>
Chapter 3, environmental edges are perceptually represented only if there is enough infor-<br>
mation to determine orientation, location or ordinal depth, length, and shape. Beforehand, <br>
nothing in the visual system discriminates essential properties of environment edges—<br>
their length and shape. Determining these properties requires manipulating more non-<br>
local information than shortest-discernible edge segments.365<br><br>
