is a more open-ended matter. In Chapter 6, the section Absence in Perception of <br>
Negations, Conditionals, Disjunctions, and Quantifiers, I argue that <br>
other putatively possible representational elements—logical constants—do not enter into <br>
perceptual representational contents. The form of the argument is that other elements are <br>
contrary to the basic representational function of perception—picking out particulars, <br>
partly by characterizing them.<br>
<br>
I think it probably <i>not</i> apriori that all perceptual systems involve an <i>indexical</i> schema or <br>
referential applications of a schema. In principle, I think, simple types of perception might <br>
not exercise framework competencies (spatial or temporal competencies) that use in dex-<br>
ic al anchoring schemas and indexical referential applications of them. Perhaps even in <br>
humans, special cases of perception may involve just simple, demonstrative-like referen-<br>
tial applications of attributives. However, all perception requires ability-general schematic <br>
demonstrative-like competencies, and referential applications of both them and guiding <br>
perceptual attributives.<br>
<br>
It is not apriori knowable that any specific animal has perception. But given our and <br>
science’s understanding of what perception is, it has the representational elements just <br>
outlined.<br>
<br>
The view of perception just outlined accords, I think, with how perceptual psychology <br>
understands perception—as picking environmental particulars that cause perceptual <br>
states and as characterizing those particulars via environmental attributes. It might be <br>
useful to contrast this account with a philosophical account that offers a perception sur-<br>
rogate. As a systematic program, the account is dead; but it is occasionally invoked, orally, <br>
in off-hand ways. This view is a fantasy, insofar as it is supposed to do the work that <br>
accounts of perception do.<br>
<br>
According to this surrogate-for-perception view, creatures place features at spatial posi-<br>
tions at given times rather than perceive particulars either as being instances of attributes <br>
or as having attributes. The only particulars in the account are spatial positions and times. <br>
Features are repeatable universals. The view was proposed by positivist empiricists as an <br>
analog of sense-data theory.40 The idea was that we have direct acquaintance with feature-<br>
types in experience. Taking these features to be positioned in the world is an inference or <br>
projection. The invocation of a spatial and temporal structure to place features within was <br>
a way of giving the projection structure and system. No particulars that are <i>instances</i> of <br>
those features are picked out or otherwise represented. No particulars that <i>have</i> such fea-<br>
tures are picked out or otherwise represented. The only particulars represented are spatial <br>
and temporal positions at which the repeatable features are placed. So instances of the <br>
attributes (including instances of features) are not represented or picked out by any singular <br><br>

N. Goodman, <i>The Structure of Appearance</i> (Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press, 1951; Indianapolis: <br>

did, however, take over sense-data ideas from Russell, Moore, and others in their understanding of experience. <br>
There are echos of this approach in A. Treisman’s early theory of binding. Feature maps can be interpreted as <br>
features placed at positions, without perceptual reference to particulars, let alone objects, at those positions: <br>
A. Treisman and G. Gelade, ‘A Feature-Integration Theory of Attention’, <i>Cognitive Psychology</i> 12 (1980), 97–136. <br>
However, Treisman’s feature maps are not clearly situated at a perceptual stage of processing. Insofar as they are <br>
not pre-perceptual, they do not clearly deny context-dependent, causally based reference to particulars that are <br>
instances of the features. In fact, it is natural to interpret them as involving such demonstrative-like reference to <br>
particulars. In any case, Treisman’s account has been shown to be empirically mistaken. See Chapter 10, the sections <br>
