A consequence of the view is that even representation of 3-D volume shapes and of spatial <br>
<i>relations</i> among perceived particulars is post-perceptual.1095<br>
<br>
This position encouraged a usage of ‘cognition’ similar to the first usage that I discussed. <br>
Both characterize cognition as input into visual processing from information that is not <br>
fully and directly generated by visual stimulation. Usage based on this view focuses more <br>
on psychological function and less on anatomy than the first usage that I criticized. But it <br>
is similar in spirit.<br>
<br>
The view is no longer tenable. It does not figure in mainstream psychophysics. Yet it still <br>
influences uses of ‘cognition’ and discussions of cognitive penetration. As mentioned in <br>
the previous section, it influenced Pylyshyn’s and others’ defense of the cognitive im pene-<br>
tra bil ity of <i>early</i>  vision, and the assumption that later stages of visual processing are cog-<br>
nitively infected.1096<br>
<br>
While there appeared to be a fairly clear break when top-down processes, so under-<br>
stood, begin to take effect, it was plausible to hold that pre-cognitive processing is strictly <br>
bottom-up analysis of the retinal image. It was plausible that something at an importantly <br>
different level enters when feedback from antecedent “models” takes hold.<br>
<br>
Once it became clear that initial categorizations occur independently of “models” from <br>
memory, and that input from task-oriented attention and from memory occurs soon after <br>
these initial categorizations—all according to easily tractable computational processes—the <br>
picture became untenable. Even so, some scientists and philosophers clung to the idea that <br>
feedback from memory and attention, constitutes cognition; and that such feedback in <br>
itself constitutes cognitive penetration of visual processing. In my view, this position now <br>
lacks any serious support.<br>
<br>
As discussed in Chapters 16–17, the “models” in memory are retentions of percep-<br>
tual representation with learned templates or other patterns. The operations are reten-<br>
tion, association, comparison, matching—all perceptual-level. There is no change in <br>
level of representation between feed-forward processing and processing that involves <br>
interaction between previous and present perceptual representation. No “thinking” <br>
goes on. There are simply associative interactions among capacities—in memory, per-<br>
ception, and anticipation—that occur among perceptual attributives. So no break of the <br>
sort required by a distinction between perception and cognition occurs when new per-<br>
ception interacts with stored perceptual or perceptually learned templates, or other <br>
perceptual memory sets.<br>
<br>
The contrary position depends on lack of serious reflection on this use of ‘cognition’, <br>
and often uses of ‘knowledge’. Taking perceptual memory as a type of knowledge is no <br>
better than taking perception as a <i>transient type of knowledge</i>. Input into visual processing <br>
from visual perceptual representation stored in memory occurs at multiple stages of visual <br>
processing. Such input is part of processing within the visual perceptual system. It is not <br>
supra-perceptual-level.<br><br>
