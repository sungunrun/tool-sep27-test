does the capacity to appreciate structural elements in music.1201 There is evidence that <br>
basic deductive reasoning may not be fundamentally linguistic, although it is, of course, <br>
harnessed by and used by linguistic capacities.1202 Language is a paradigmatic source of <br>
propositional-level cognition. But philosophers would do well to free themselves from <br>
assumptions that propositional cognition is essentially linguistic. Such a view became <br>
entrenched through a language-centric focus that dominated philosophy from the middle <br>
to the end of the twentieth century.1203<br>
<br>
Of course, mastery and use of language is a form of propositional representation. <br>
Understanding language development is central to understanding propositional cogni-<br>
tion. It is an open question whether all propositional representation depends for its <i>devel-<br>
opment</i> on linguistic capacities. Even if it did, one should be open about relations between <br>
linguistic representation and cognition, including propositional cognition that is not obvi-<br>
ously linguistic.<br>
<br>
A near obsessive focus on language in philosophy led to neglect of perception after the <br>
fall of sense-data theories in the 1950s. (See this chapter, the section The Original <br>
Epistemic Grounds for Reflecting on Cognitive Influence on <br>
Perception.) All the most prominent philosophers in the period failed to think ser-<br>
ious ly or knowledgeably about perception. All failed to recognize the most elementary <br>
form of representation—perceptual attribution guiding singular reference—and its cap-<br>
acity to function independently from cognition, including language. A focus on language <br>
lingers in philosophy, although it is less dominant than three or four decades ago. In <br>
reflecting on cognitive capacities, philosophy should not repeat the mistake it made in its <br>
construal of sensory capacities. There are many types of cognition, even many types in <br>
propositional form. Language use is a central type. A rich philosophy of mind must be <br>
alive to other types.<br>
<br>
In this section, I have tried to model search for elementary types of cognition, prop os-<br>
ition al or otherwise. Grounding the exploration in comparisons with what is known about <br>
perception and perceptual-level capacities is, I think, the beginning of wisdom in this wide-<br>
open area for investigating the nature of the upper border of lower representational mind.<br><br>
