I believe that time is <i>never</i> perceived.290 That is why I specify that coordination of tem-<br>
poral sensitivity be with perception of ‘<i>other matters</i>’. Perception requires a causal relation <br>
to the perceived entity through sensory receptors. Time itself lacks relevant causal rela-<br>
tions to sensory receptors. Although temporal and spatial magnitudes are correctly postu-<br>
lated as real in causal explanation, they are not themselves causes—at any rate, not the <br>
sorts of causes that can be perceived. They themselves do not cause sensory receptors to <br>
respond. The causes of responses in sensory receptors are events <i>in</i> time. The events have <br>
durations, of course. The events are sometimes occurrent <i>conditions</i> or <i>aspects</i> of entities <br>
like surfaces or bodies. Temporal moments or intervals are indexed, and temporal rela-<br>
tions and properties are attributed, in perception. Neither type of perceptual representa-<br>
tion of time is perception of time.<br>
<br>
Peacocke’s prime counter-example to my account of conditions under which time is <br>
primitively represented in perception goes as follows:<br><br>

<b>FOOTNOTES</b><br>
<b>Cont FN</b>290 Here I join Kant, William James, and many others. See Kant, <i>Critique of Pure Reason</i>, B233–B234; <br>
W. James, <i>Principles of Psychology</i> (New York: Holt, 1910), 583; J. Gibson, ‘Events are Perceivable But Time Is <br>
Not’, in J. Fraser and N. Lawrence eds., <i>The Study of Time</i>, vol. 2 (Berlin: Springer, 1975); P. Fraisse, ‘Perception <br>
and Estimation of Time’, <i>Annual Review of Psychology</i> 35 (1984), 1–36. Peacocke supports the idea of experience <br>
of ‘empty time’. He appears to make the point in opposition to Kant and James. But he means by ‘empty time’ only <br>
that there are no experienced (or perceived) events <i>during</i> the duration. He allows experienced events at the <br>
endpoints of the duration, <i>The Primacy of Metaphysics</i>, 75. This claim is not incompatible with anything that <br>
Kant or (I suspect, James) claimed. As a consequence of the fact that we do not perceive time, Kant claimed that <br>
temporal relations can be perceptually represented only if they are applied to perceived entities other than tem-<br>
poral relations, temporal magnitudes, time intervals, or moments. (See the citation above.) I take this claim to <br>
apply to temporal indexing as well. A time can be indexed in perception only if the index anchors a temporal <br>
relation to a (purportedly) perceived entity that is not itself a time, but is <i>in</i> time. Peacocke misunderstands Kant. <br>
I believe, contrary to Kant, that indexes to time can get their purchase not only through perception (for Kant, <br>
sensibility), but through intellectual referential applications to thought events. See the last section in T. Burge, <br>
‘Frege on Apriority’, in C. Peacocke and P. Boghossian eds., <i>New Essays on the A Priori</i> (Oxford, Oxford University <br>
Press, 2000). I do agree with Peacocke that perceptually attributed temporal magnitudes are objective and are not <br>
reducible to anything else. I think his development of the traditional notion of unit-free magnitude is valuable. <br>
My central point is that although temporal (and spatial) magnitudes are perceptually attributed, they are not <br>
perceived.<br>
<br>
Peacocke also badly misrepresents Kant as a subjectivist about time. He assimilates Kant’s idealism to sub-<br>
ject iv ism, interpreting Kant to hold that ‘it makes no more sense to say that it applies to mind-independent <br>
events than it does to say that a relation of subjective similarity applies to inexperienced things’ and that <br>
‘real time is perceptually inaccessible’: Peacocke, <i>The Primacy of Metaphysics</i>, 78. Peacocke reads Kant’s com-<br>
ments about time’s being a subjective condition of human intuition (for example, Kant, <i>Critique of Pure <br>
Reason</i>, B51–52) without noting that they are made from the transcendental point of view. From that point <br>
of view, not only time but the moon, indeed everything discussed in physics, is mind-dependent. That does <br>
not make them subjective, without qualification, for Kant. Even within the transcendental point of view <br>
there is a distinction between attributives with objective reality, which the concept of time, for Kant, cer-<br>
tainly has, and lack of objective reality. Kant contrasted the transcendental point of view with the “empirical <br>
point of view”—the point of view of em pir ic al science and mathematics. Kant firmly thought that both <br>
points of view are cognition and are objective. Temporal attribution is as “objectively real” and “objectively <br>
valid”, for Kant, as attribution of body or shape. His project is to explain the objective validity of representa-<br>
tions in the physical sciences—which certainly included, for him, representations of time. Both time and the <br>
moon are objective and mind-independent from the (ob ject ive and valid) point of view of theoretical cogni-<br>
tion—the physical and mathematical sciences. From that ob ject ive point of view, time does modify a mind-<br>
independent thing—the moon, for example. This point certainly makes more sense to Kant than the idea that <br>
‘a relation of subjective similarity applies to inexperienced things’, to recite Peacocke’s words. Kant thought <br>
that time is perceptually accessible, even for animals that lack concepts. He thought that temporal relations <br>
are perceptually attributed in human and animals perceptual systems, though not cognizable by animals. <br>
He simply thought (correctly) that time cannot itself be perceived, because it lacks relevant causal powers. <br>
I reject Kant’s transcendental idealism. But his position on the unperceivability of time does not, for <br>
him, render time perceptually “inaccessible”, or subjective, in any way opposed to objective claims of <br>
physical science.</div><div id="PGHEADER">
