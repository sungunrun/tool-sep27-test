Marr’s 2½-D Sketch 379</div>

pre-perceptual parallel to the Marr/Ullman view that egocentric relations to surfaces are <br>
computed before ordinal depth relations among surfaces. There is this difference. The <br>
Marr/Ullman view concerns the <i>perceptual representation</i> of egocentrically anchored dis-<br>
tance relations to surfaces and the ordinal depth relations among surfaces—not pre-<br>
perceptual registrations of disparity on the retinal image. The computations of disparities <br>
in first-pass V1 and V2 are pre-perceptual. They are insufficient to trigger perceptions as of <br>
depth relations, or any other perceptual representations.<br>
<br>
Once perceptual constancies emerge and surfaces are represented in 3-D space, percep-<br>
tions of ordinal-depth among surfaces are not computed at a later, or different, stage from <br>
distance relations from the perceiver. These computations do not depend on occurrent sup-<br>
plements from memory or attention. Ordinal-depth and distance relations among perceived <br>
entities are computed in the perceptual system proper—contrary to the Marr/Ullman view. <br>
Such computations are not even the latest computations of the perceptual system. <br>
Representations of 3-D volume shapes and bodies are also computed very fast. Computing <br>
some spatial relations among visible surfaces of volume 3-D volume shapes, on one hand, and <br>
basic categorizations, on the other, do not depend on memory or applications of attention.403<br>
<br>
Formation of perceptual representation of <i>ordinal depth relations</i> among bodies, or sur-<br>
faces, from disparity cues is very well understood in psychophysics. The laws of formation <br>
of perceptual attributives for ordinal depth and 3-D volume shape do not require input <br>
from attention. The laws incorporate information about eye direction and disparity of the <br>
two retinal images. Nothing about attention, except insofar as attention is a natural con-<br>
comitant of the foveated areas of visual perception, must be involved in first-formed per-<br>
ception. Only attention in advance of stimulus, or this natural-concomitant attention, is <br>
involved. Depth from disparity is achieved outside the foveated areas, as well as in them. <br>
Ordinal depth relations are computed from binocular disparity in some of the earliest pro-<br>
cessing stages of <i>perceptual</i> representations.404<br>
<br>
Thus successful explanations of depth relations among surfaces runs counter to postu-<br>
lation of a 2½-D sketch as a major stage in perceptual processing. According to that postu-<br>
lation, prior to more top-down input, such as attention applications in visual search, the <br>
visual system produces only a sketch of surfaces in various orientations. Representation of <br>
spatial relations among these surfaces was supposed to consist entirely in distance or <br>
or din al depth relations from the perceiver—<i>not</i> in spatial relations to one another. But <br>
perceptual constancies for 3-D volume shapes and relations are evident much earlier in <br>
visual processing than was thought in the 1980s and 1990s. Psychophysical work on per-<br>
ceptual determination of 3-D volume shape provides no <i>essential</i> role for attention. <br>
Disparity cues suffice to determine visual attribution of 3-D attributes. Combinations of <br>
textural and motion cues also determine them.405 The most basic perceptual representations <br><br>
