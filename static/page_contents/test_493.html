Richer Perceptual Categorization and Its Processing 493</div>

first-formed categorizations are conceptual, on any clear and motivated conception of <br>
what it is to be conceptual.<br>
<br>
The basic problem for the reasoning just discussed is a defective conception of what a <br>
concept is. The main mark of the conceptual is contributing constitutively to supra-<br>
perceptual-level capacities, prominently propositional inference. The main mark of what it <br>
is to be a perceptual attributive is being generated by a perceptual system, comprised of <br>
perceptual or perceptual-level competencies. We learn what a perceptual system is em pir-<br>
ic al ly, as a relevantly unified system of perceptual or perceptual-level capacities. We learn <br>
what perceptual and perceptual-level capacities are by starting with defeasible, modifiable <br>
conceptions and refining them via empirical investigation. It is empirically known, I think, <br>
that perceptual systems generate only attributives that do not function constitutively to <br>
contribute to propositional capacities.<br><br>

<b>Richer Perceptual Categorization and Perceptual  <br>
<br>
Processing that Contributes to It<br><br>
</div>
</b>I proceed on the assumption, grounded in perceptual psychology, that there are <i>perceptual</i> <br>
attributives that categorize. Categorizations of bodies and faces by 3-D volume shape <br>
are cases.<br>
<br>
The main drift of the earliest stages of visual processing is from coarse, low-spatial- <br>
 frequency representation to finer-grained representation with higher spatial frequency. <br>
The time course of perceptual categorization proceeds from super-super-ordinate and <br>
super-ordinate categorization to more specific—basic level, subordinate, and recognition-<br>
level—categorization. From the outset, there is recurrent feedback in and among visual <br>
areas.655 But during the first 120–150 ms after stimulus onset, perceptual processing is <br>
dominantly feedforward. Such processing produces, by 60–80 ms, categorizations. First-<br>
formed cat egor iza tions are embedded in spatial constancies, which usually derive from <br>
application bases in spatial property attributives. A primate visual perceptual system can <br>
attribute <i>face</i>, <i>body</i>, and <i>animal-body</i> under a wide range of proximal stimulations in this <br>
first pass. (See Chapter 10.)<br>
<br>
The primary spatial constancies are those of location, size, surface shape, and 3-D vol-<br>
ume shape. This is “at a glance” perception. Despite its sketch-like character, it can be the <br>
most crucial type for preservation of life. Processing grows more specific in the next 70–80 <br>
ms, to 150 ms, as higher spatial-frequency information is integrated into the attributives.656<br><br>
