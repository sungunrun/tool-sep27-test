748 Conclusion</div>
<br><br>
representational success are in place, norms for doing it well are in place. Of course, in <br>
itself, representational success in perception, or even thought, falls well short of the most <br>
noble ideals. <i>Just</i> having veridical representation is a poor thing to live for. But when <br>
 veridical representation requires capacities under meta-representational control—intending <br>
to observe and attend well, for example—, it begins to offer a sensible alternative to fulfill-<br>
ing biological needs and functions. The cave artist’s close observation is not alien to <br>
Rembrandt, Velasquez, Ver Meer, or Monet’s use of observation to understand something <br>
new about experience, and things represented in it or inferred from it. Often such art <br>
 cen ters on represented particulars. Sometimes it represents attributes, schematically, with <br>
no reference to particulars. To count as representational art, some intention and some <br>
 understanding of a point to the representation seem necessary.<br>
<br>
Norms for observation, reasoning, knowledge, understanding, choice—and projects <br>
in art, in science, in morality, in philosophy, in common wisdom about living, and in <br>
inter-personal relations—are in place once relevant representational capacities are in <br>
place. For example, meeting fundamental moral norms centers on respect for, hence rep-<br>
resentation of, creatures that can use representational resources rationally, or otherwise <br>
well. Such projects have plausibly been thought to be worth living and dying for. They are <br>
projects whose norms for success are independent of whether anyone knows or cares <br>
about them. For humans, they are worthier projects than those of fulfilling biological <br>
needs and functions.1210<br>
<br>
Representational mind made these new projects possible. Perception is the first form <br>
of representational mind. Other forms are more sophisticated. They built on perception, <br>
and on capacities constitutive of it. They assimilated reference and attribution. They <br>
expanded states capable of accuracy to states capable of truth and of giving explanations. <br>
They enriched perceptual memory, anticipation, and learning to propositional knowledge, <br>
propositional prediction, and rational reasoning. These capacities, in turn, formed a basis <br>
for understanding—understanding the world, understanding norms and goods, under-<br>
standing minds. From the seed of perception grew most of what makes human life rich <br>
and worthwhile.<br>
