354 The Iconic Nature of Perception</div>
<br><br>
Directional relations <i>are</i> preserved in the 1–1-into mapping. If a visually perceived part <br>
<i>x</i> occupying <i>Big Surface</i> is to the left of a visually perceived part <i>y</i>, then any part of the <br>
representational content <i>r</i> that represents <i>x</i> is situated to (a structural analog of) the left of <br>
the part of the representational content <i>r1</i> that represents <i>y</i>. In this case the converse also <br>
holds. If a part of the representational content <i>r</i> that functions to represent <i>x</i> is situated to <br>
(a structural analog of) the left of the representational content <i>r1</i> that functions to repre-<br>
sent <i>y</i>, then, if the perceptual content is veridical, <i>x</i> is to the left of <i>y</i>, both on <i>Big Surface</i>, <br>
from the anchor of the perceiver.<br>
<br>
Let us combine three points. First, directional relations, unlike distance relations, are <br>
bi-directionally preserved in 1–1 mappings between relevant parts of the representational <br>
contents and relevant parts of the surface in 3-D environmental space. Second, these spa-<br>
tial relations, and their analogs in the arrangement of parts of visual-perceptual represen-<br>
tation are clearly natural. Third, this preservation of directional spatial relations in <br>
representational content figures in the way that perception represents spatial arrangements <br>
in natural scenes. These three points suffice to make visual perception iconic. Of course, <br>
there are many other ways in which visual perception is iconic. This is a central way.<br>
<br>
I wrote of <i>structural analogs</i> of direction in perceptual representational content. Of <br>
course, the representational content is not literally in space. Except for referential applica-<br>
tions, it is an abstract psychological kind with a geometrical or topological mathematical <br>
structure. The instantiations of representational content in a perceptual system—the <br>
 representations—are at least roughly located in space. The point is, however, that the rep-<br>
resentational content and the representations have a broadly geometrical or topological <br>
structure that maps in natural ways into the structure of a 2-D layout. It maps into <i>Big <br>
Surface</i>.<br>
<br>
All perception is from a perceiver’s perspective. The perspective is a perspective on a <br>
3-D world. Vision and touch represent 3-D volume shapes and bodies by representing facing <br>
surfaces of the shapes and bodies. One visually represents much more than surfaces, but <br>
one does so only by representing surfaces (including partly occluded ones) by way of rep-<br>
resenting visible parts of surfaces that occupy the positions of <i>Big Surface</i>. One sees a body, <br>
as well as its visible surfaces, but only by way of seeing those surfaces, or parts of them.373<br><br>

<b>FOOTNOTES</b><br>
<b>Cont FN</b>373 For discussions of a similar perspective on computer programing of iconic representation, see Pinker, <br>
‘A Computational Theory of the Mental Imagery Medium’; and J. Glasgow and D. Papadias, ‘Computational <br>
Imagery’ in Glasgow, Narayanan, and Chandrasekaran eds., <i>Diagrammatic Reasoning: Cognitive and <br>
Computational Perspectives</i>. Pinker’s article includes an excellent review of preceding accounts of imagery that <br>
systematically underrate its 3-D representational import. He takes representational content of imagery to be <br>
structurally similar to representational content of perception. He discusses, correctly I think, the presence in <br>
the representational content, and the computer program, of iconic elements that represent 3-D and do so <br>
perspectivally.<br>
I think, however, that he fails to make an important distinction. The failure is marked by his misleading claim <br>
that one “sees” the perspectival facts (for example, the railroad tracks as being closer to one another at a distance <br>
than they are nearby). Although he places ‘sees’ in scare quotes, the correct view is, I think, that one normally <br>
sees, or forms imagery of, such tracks as parallel, full stop. The <i>way</i> of perceiving or imagining them involves <br>
iconic representational content whose lines grow closer insofar as they represent greater distance. That is part of <br>
the mode of presentation—the way in which one perceives them as parallel. It is part of the perspective, not <br>
normally part of what of seen. Only with training can one take up the painter’s perspective on the perspective <br>
itself. And the painter is looking at a planar canvas. The subject matter of perception is 3-D. This perspectival <br>
aspect of perception is not an object of perception. Of course, visual perception also attributes perspectival rela-<br>
tions like  orientation—slant and tilt—with respect to viewing position.</div>
