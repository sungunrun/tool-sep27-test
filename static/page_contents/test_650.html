do all the attributional work in perception. Some left no psychological or epistemic <br>
room between non-representational sensing and conceiving—or even between non-<br>
representational sensing and applying linguistic expressions. Sellars, Strawson, Quine, <br>
Davidson, McDowell made such claims from the armchair, rather than from reflecting on <br>
empirical work on perception. Such claims have been left behind by scientific progress and <br>
undermined by philosophical argument.1045 No mainstream vision scientist takes ser-<br>
ious ly the idea that perceptual attribution or perceptual reference <i>requires</i> language. No <br>
mainstream vision scientist thinks that perception normally relies on input from belief <br>
into computational formation of perception, much less <i>requires</i> such input.<br>
<br>
In the 1950s some psychologists made parallel claims about perception’s requiring con-<br>
cepts, with different motivations. New Look psychologists held that perception sys tem at ic-<br>
al ly depends on concepts.1046 The view remained influential into the 1970s. Then, as now, <br>
the term ‘concept’ was used in various ways, usually without a precise meaning. New Look <br>
psychology seemed to imply, however, that perception is inevitably theory-laden. So it <br>
implied that perception depends on input from concepts, in my sense of ‘concept’—com-<br>
ponents of propositional structures.<br>
<br>
The philosophers whose views paralleled New Look psychology held them as part of a <br>
theory of necessary conditions for representation, or intentionality, or reference. Although <br>
some found New Look psychology congenial, few were interested enough in psychology <br>
to be influenced by it.<br>
<br>
Another group of philosophers paid more attention to New Look Psychology and used <br>
it.1047 They took it to support doubts about the objectivity of science. The primary impetus <br>
for their doubts stemmed from their theories of meaning.<br>
<br>
As part of his critique of positivism, W.V. Quine espoused <i>meaning holism</i>. On this <br>
view, units of empirical meaning are not words or sentences, but systems of sentences—<br>
theories. Quine questioned a distinction between differences in belief and differences in <br>
meaning.<br>
<br>
Several philosophers inferred from less radical analogs of Quine’s meaning holism that <br>
there is no objective way to decide between scientific theories that differ in <i>basic</i> the or et-<br>
ic al commitments. The idea was that the linguistic meaning of scientific statements <br>
depends on, and only on, the inferences that they figure in. For Quine, all inferences <br>
counted. This view suggested that any difference in theory leaves no common ground <br><br>
