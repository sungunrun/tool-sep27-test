other resources, perception represents only an extremely limited range of en tities. These <br>
entities do not include bodies with multiple properties and do not enter into spatial rela-<br>
tions with one another. On these views, the first <i>representata</i> of perception are nothing like <br>
what we normally think we see.<br>
<br>
Experiments underlying all these lines, especially the latter two, have made enduring <br>
contributions to understanding vision. However, all three views have been shown to be <br>
mistaken.<br>
<br>
There is substantial evidence that some detail in any well-lit part of a scene, even  outside <br>
the foveal center of a perception, is computed very quickly from very brief exposures. <br>
Perceiving bodies in 3-D space does not depend on supplements from attention, memory, <br>
or concepts. Much is lost to easily accessible, conscious memory. Attentional supplements <br>
are often necessary to preserve much that is perceived in a conscious, easily accessible way. <br>
But even without the supplements, much of the detail can be found in memory, and even <br>
brought to consciousness, through various special techniques. Since detail can be elicited, <br>
even though it cannot easily and directly be made conscious, it is present in the individu-<br>
al’s psychology, retained from perception.<br>
<br>
Computations of very specific body-shapes and attributions of more specific body cat-<br>
egor ies like face and animal-body do not depend essentially on visual search. They can <br>
occur without help from attention. They do not depend on specific, current input <br>
from memory.<br>
<br>
What I mean by ‘specific, current input’ is input into perception-formation from <br>
 memory during formation of a perceptual state. Absence of specific, current input from <br>
memory is compatible with memory’s having affected the state of the visual system prior <br>
to stimulus onset. Absence of such current memory input in the first formations of per-<br>
ception is also compatible with its occurring later in the formation of richer perceptions.<br>
<br>
I have given overview answers to our two questions. The first question is what do first-<br>
formed perceptions represent. The second is what help, if any, first-formed perceptions <br>
require from further psychological capacities, such as input from attention, memory, or <br>
concepts, in order to represent physical bodies, 3-D spatial relations, shapes, and other <br>
properties of physical bodies. I now elaborate this overview.<br>
<br>
The next section frames the discussion. In each of the subsequent three sections, I elab-<br>
orate one of the lines work just sketched. Then I discuss findings that undermined the <br>
views that the three lines of work proposed. The findings undermined the shared view that <br>
first-formed perception is impoverished and requires supplementary contributions to rep-<br>
resent anything like physical bodies as such. Finally, I sketch consequences for under-<br>
standing first-formed perception.<br><br>

<b>Framework<br><br>
</div>
</b>Perception is a dynamic process. Different types of perceptual processing take different <br>
amounts of time. For example, some visual processes for determining shape from motion <br>
require several views of a moving object.390 Other processes for determining motion, <br><br>
