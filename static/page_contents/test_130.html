<i>cu bic al</i>. In the case of generic and relatively generic perceptual attributives, one cannot <br>
expect things to be quite so intuitive. Even if one takes attributives for partially occluded <br>
shapes to apply to projections of fully formed shapes, and even if one takes face sketches to <br>
project in similar ways, the range of shapes that could trigger body, or body-part, attribu-<br>
tives in any given individual at any given time probably corresponds to no natural-seeming <br>
shape gestalt. By studying the range of shapes in any given case, one could measure exactly <br>
the parameters that, if varied, would leave a shape outside the grouping. Such a grouping <br>
may correspond to no natural gestalt shape.<br>
<br>
These reflections might tempt one to think that there are no generic perceptual shape <br>
attributives—only the specific shape attributives. One might draw this conclusion because <br>
one thought that there is nothing more to the generic shape than a disjunction of specific <br>
shapes. Hence no “kind” for a generic attributive to indicate. Such reasoning would <br>
be mistaken.<br>
<br>
It is true that relevant generic shapes are usually not of interest to physics or geometry. <br>
But the shapes are not “disjunctive”, except relative to explanation in those sciences. The <br>
groupings are of shape-patterns that signal facial expression types, or edible body-types, <br>
or generic bodies, or what not. They have an objectivity like that of the North Sea, to use <br>
Frege’s example.136 The fact that a grouping or kind is systematically relevant to shipping <br>
routes and territorial claims, or to recognition of faces, or edible bodies, or generic bodies, <br>
suffices to give it objective-kind status, even if the sciences of physics and geometry do not <br>
refer to it.<br>
<br>
Perceptual groupings are referred to in scientific statements of psychological laws. Such <br>
groupings form kinds of perceptual states in individuals. Perceptual attributives mark <br>
those states. For these reasons, perceptual representation occurs at both specific and <br>
generic levels. The most specific levels correspond to the finest grain that perceivers can <br>
discriminate and embed in perceptual constancies. More generic levels correspond to per-<br>
ceptual groupings or perceptual equivalence classes for a perceiver. The most generic <br>
 levels correspond to large features of psychological architecture. The kinds higher than the <br>
finest-grain levels are psychologically significant because they enter into computations of <br>
further perceptual or cognitive attributives, preservations in memory, or computations of <br>
actional states.<br><br>
