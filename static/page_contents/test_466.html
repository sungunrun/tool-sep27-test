read, ‘x1 in contact with x3 at p2’. ‘By(x2, x1)’ is read: (movement) x2 by (body) x1. ‘Causes’ <br>
represents the movement x2 (by body x1) as causing the movement x4 (by body x3).<br>
<br>
This form omits temporal representation. It abstracts from iconic format. The place <br>
markers, ‘p1’, ‘p2’, and ‘p3’, designate positions on a spatial grid in relation to the anchor <br>
position, ego-cego x0. In iconic format, they are attributed by positions in the grid that con-<br>
stitutes an attribution. No canonical names occur in the full content. The displayed content <br>
omits the movement’s path. Representation of the path would be simple in an iconic for-<br>
mat. The mode of presentation of cause is derivative from the representations of the <br>
motions and the contact, and the modes of presentation of the from and by attributives <br>
derive from the shape orientations of the moving bodies.<br>
<br>
There are several ways to parse key factors in representation of causation. In addition to <br>
representation of the causal relation, there is representation of the causal role of body x1 in <br>
the causal event, movement x2. There is representation of the effect role of body x3, inas-<br>
much as it is the entity that undergoes the caused movement x4. Representation of dis-<br>
tinct ive asymmetric roles is an important feature of primitive representation of causation.<br>
<br>
This feature is prominent in the most primitive <i>propositional</i> structures. It may be a <br>
universal feature of quite early sentences of human language. It informs the thematic <br>
structure of much primitive propositional thought. Inasmuch as causation is perceptually <br>
represented, the basic thematic structure of causal attribution is present. I conjecture that <br>
that structure is carried over into the most basic propositional structures that represent <br>
causation.<br><br>

<b>Primitive Attribution of Agency<br><br>
</div>
</b>Like primitive attribution of <i>causation</i>, primitive attribution of <i>agency</i> is not as well under-<br>
stood as perceptual attribution of <i>body</i>. I think it likely that attribution of agency, like that <br>
of causation, occurs in complex visual systems. Again, however, I focus on the methodo-<br>
logical. I center on empirical considerations that bear on whether representation of agency <br>
is perceptual.<br>
<br>
Heider and Simmel in 1944 and Michotte in 1946 showed that certain movements of <br>
abstract shapes elicit impressions of types of agency, such as pursuit, attack, fleeing.606 <br>
Much of the value in their experiments lay in suggesting that certain movements, inde-<br>
pendently of the shape of the moving entity, were basic cues for agency representation.<br>
<br>
As in the case of causal representation, their reliance on subjects’ judgments prevented <br>
determining the psychological level at which representation of agency first arises— <br>
perceptual or supra-perceptual. Michotte thought that the level was perceptual because <br>
the judgments seemed automatic and seemed to depend on specific details of movement. <br>
For reasons discussed in the preceding section, these considerations do not show what <br>
Michotte thought they showed. Later research investigated in greater detail various cues <br>
on which impressions of agency are founded.<br>
<br>
Most such work centered on motion cues. However, not all primitive agency represen-<br>
tation depends on motion. Fast visual processing provides gist-like representations that <br><br>
