such displays, always appeared near one another. Unconscious encoding of these statistics <br>
enabled subjects to hold in working memory nearly twice as many color pairs as a group <br>
of subjects who saw similar displays without such regularities. Unconscious statistical <br>
learning enables subjects to form chunked representations of familiar color pairs.915<br>

Perceptual working memory is working memory that functions to preserve perceptual <br>
representational contents. I have focused on perceptual visual working memory, but I think <br>
that the key points transfer to perceptual working memory in other modalities. What is <br>
perceptually attended to, hence what is preserved in perceptual working memory, can be <br>
causally influenced by what one conceptually attends to. But computational ex plan ations <br>
of the workings of perceptual working memory show no signs of making essential appeal <br>
to propositional capacities, or any other supra-perceptual-level capacities. Computational <br>
explanations of how perceptual working memory operates, in interaction with perception, <br>
perceptual attention, perceptual attention commands, and other types of perceptual mem-<br>
ory invoke no states, contents, or operations that are at a higher representational level than <br>
those in perception itself. If one distinguishes its retentive functions from supra-perceptual <br>
operations on it, there is reason to believe that perceptual working memory is perceptual-<br>
level. There is a natural psychological kind—consisting of the capacity for perceptual-level <br>
operations of perceptual working memory—that is a species of the more generic natural <br>
psychological kinds—<i>non-symbolic working memory</i> and <i>working memory</i>. The perceptual-<br>
level working memory system is computationally integrated with perception and with <br>
perception guided, relatively primitive action.<br><br>

</b>A further type of short-term memory has been called a type of “conceptual” memory. The <br>
discoverer of this sort of memory, Mary Potter, called it ‘<i>conceptual short-term memory</i>’ <br>
(CSTM).916 I use her acronym with invisible scare quotes around the ‘C’. Potter holds that <br>
CSTM retains both conceptual and perceptual representation. So she thinks that CSTM is <br>
not purely conceptual. I think that she is right about this. Thus I think it would be better to <br>
think of CSTM as a generic system with sub-systems that have, respectively, perceptual <br>
and conceptual retentive functions and representational levels. I will argue that there is <br>
room for improvement in Potter’s understanding of relations between conceptual and <br>
perceptual-level operations in CSTM.<br>
<br>
CSTM was discovered through the method of rapid serial visual presentation (RSVP) <br>
discussed in Chapter 10 (see Figure 10.1).917 A sequence of 6 to 12 previously unseen pic-<br>
tures is shown observers at various speeds from 10 ms to 2 seconds per picture. Subjects <br>
are first asked to recall freely whether or not a picture appears in a sequence. They are <br><br>
