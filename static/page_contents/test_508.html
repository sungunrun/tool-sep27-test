older, evolutionarily, than representational affect, as action is older than representationally <br>
guided action. A snail’s agitation exhibited in foaming when it senses danger evinces pre-<br>
representational affect. Possibly, some wasp agitation is pre-representational, although <br>
wasps have visual perception. Affect takes on representational powers when it is informed <br>
by perception. Then I count it <i>emotion</i>. (See note 771.) A perception of something as dan-<br>
gerous causes an affect that constitutes a fear as of the particular, where the particular is <br>
perceptually represented. Such representational affect is a contributing cause to action. <br>
Obviously, the representational genus, emotion, comes in species at different representa-<br>
tional levels. Depression over recessions is propositional-level; an impala’s fear of a per-<br>
ceived lion is perceptual-level. Although I have not given emotion a separate section, I <br>
believe that it parallels the other generic representational capacities being explored—<br>
attention, conation, memory, learning, anticipation, imagining—in having perceptual and <br>
supra-perceptual-level species, and in entering into a psychological system with other <br>
perceptual-level psychological capacities. I encourage exploring affect and different repre-<br>
sentational levels of emotion.<br><br>

<b>Form of Relatively Primitive Conative States<br><br>
</div>
</b>Representational states that function to initiate action have a conative, rather than specifi-<br>
cational, mode. Their veridicality conditions are fulfilled if an action fulfills their represen-<br>
tational content and is the natural and functional causal consequence of the state. Some <br>
representational conative states set targets for action. Others constitute motor commands <br>
for realizing the action target. Every representationally guided action depends causally on <br>
a conative state. Since the primary function of perception is to pick out and characterize, <br>
no action guided by perception is ever initiated by a perceptual state alone. Movements <br>
and perhaps even actions can be caused directly by perception. Such movements or actions <br>
are not guided by perception. They are effects of perception without being perceptually <br>
guided. To be psychologically guided, an action must derive causally from a psy cho logic al <br>
state whose function is to produce the action. (See Chapter 8, the section Is Temporal <br>
Representation Constitutive to Perceptual Representation?) A psy-<br>
chological state whose function is to produce action is a conative state—an actional state. <br>
Guidance of action by perceptual states is solidly evinced in the psychological <br>
literature.680<br>
<br>
In relatively primitive action, perception usually causes a <i>conative</i>  state—a state whose <br>
function is to cause action. A representational conative state represents a <i>target</i> (flying to a <br>
prey) and <i>target-object</i> (the prey). Target-setting states and perception—and its associates, <br>
perceptual memory and perceptual anticipation—join with a conative motor command <br>
state to cause action. As the action proceeds, perceptual, target-setting, and new motor <br><br>
