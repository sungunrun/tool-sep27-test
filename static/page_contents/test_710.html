motor activity going. Such stipulations have an <i>ad hoc</i> flavor. They are not parts of normal <br>
scientific explanation.<br>
<br>
Second, only beliefs and intentions whose content is a propositionalized version of the <br>
perceptual-level attention command or motor command gives even the appearance of fall-<br>
ing into a pattern that could be explained computationally. Selecting very specific beliefs <br>
and intentions that “work” does not add to systematic understanding. The beliefs and <br>
intention types would be selected only because they make computing a function easier. <br>
Their content types are selected because they derive from the perceptual-level content <br>
types. The perceptual-level types produce the computation whether or not they are caused <br>
by an instance of the propositional-level types.<br>
<br>
Third, really the point underlying the second: What is distinctive about the prop os-<br>
ition al states—their place in a network of reason-providing and explanation-providing <br>
inferences—plays no role in the extended computation. It is only by <i>bracketing</i> those <br>
states’ inferential connections to other propositional states that one can allow them into a <br>
workable computation. Then, their occurring in the computation contributes nothing to <br>
understanding a <i>system</i> of computation.<br>
<br>
Explanations that cite propositional-level causes do provide insight into causal connec-<br>
tions between propositional states and the perceptual motor system. Such explanations do <br>
not yield insight into the <i>systematic</i> computational pattern that results in production of <br>
perceptual-level states. They just select elements of another system, held together by prop-<br>
os ition al inference, that do, on some occasions, causally determine the inputs that the <br>
computational system actually, systematically operates upon.<br><br>

<b>Psychological Systems and Psychological Kinds<br><br>

</b>I have used the terms ‘visual system’, ‘visuo-motor system’, ‘perceptual system’, ‘perceptual-<br>
motor system’, leaving them open-ended. I think that they mark psychological natural <br>
kinds. The kinds overlap and interlock. Can we reduce the open-endedness a bit?<br>

Systems talk is common in psychology. For example, talk of dual systems, or system 1 <br>
and system 2 psychologies, has been popular in several branches of psychology for dec-<br>
ades.1162 There is little order in this talk. Broadly, proponents of this duality divide <br><br>
