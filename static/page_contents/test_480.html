480 Primitive Attribution of Causation, Agency</div>

psy cho logic al states with representational structure and veridicality conditions to snails. <br>
Their sensing exhibits no perceptual constancies. Their acts can be causally explained in <br>
sparer terms—terms that attribute functional targets of activity and capacities to sense <br>
that facilitate reaching targets.<br>
<br>
The notion of <i>sensing</i> is not distinctively psychological. It entails neither consciousness <br>
nor representation, in a sense that requires states to have veridicality conditions as aspects <br>
of their causal natures. In giving non-psychological explanations of snail acts, we do not <br>
invoke distinctively psychological states. The most primitive representations of action are <br>
surely similar.<br>
<br>
Analogous points apply to expectations that the snail will act in a maximally efficient <br>
way. It responds to its sensory intake by crawling in as straight a line as possible, other <br>
things being equal. Taking it to act efficiently does not involve taking it to represent the <br>
world, much less represent it in a practically rational way. Practical rationality aims at effi-<br>
ciency. Efficiency is often obtained through non-psychological mechanisms.<br>
<br>
We account for a lot of animal agency in causal, functional, non-psychological terms. <br>
One can account for an animal’s representation of agency, and of sensory resources to <br>
guide that agency, without taking the animal to represent the agent as having representa-<br>
tional states. I think that perceptual systems do not represent the psychological states of <br>
other agents. I think it plausible, but not established, that they attribute agency and much <br>
of its basic relational structure.<br><br>
