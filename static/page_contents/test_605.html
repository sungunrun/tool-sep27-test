perceptual as well as conceptual. So the decoy experiments by themselves provide no evi-<br>
dence that CSTM contains concepts.<br>
<br>
Potter writes,<br><br>
. . . we do not know whether the picture representation that persists for several seconds in <br>
<br>
the studies we have reviewed here is sufficiently abstract to be considered conceptual <br>
<br>
rather than wholly or partly perceptual. Do viewers remember only the pictures’ concep-<br>
<br>
tual content or do they also remember visual features such as color, shape, and layout?934<br><br>
The phrasing of this question biases answers in misleading ways. The phrasing is of a piece <br>
with taking all categorization to be conceptual. Potter’s thinking of concepts as differing <br>
from percepts by degree of abstraction underestimates perception’s capacity to produce <br>
abstract representations—representations that allow a large variety of instances, differing <br>
in specific shape or size, or color-shade. Perceptual systems group attributes into equiva-<br>
lence classes in many ways, as the grouping of bodies by closed outer boundary and by <br>
animal-shape illustrates. Even grouping a large number of surface orientations as instances <br>
of a given shape, shows that regarding perception as incompatible with abstraction is a <br>
mistake. Analogous points apply to taking conception to be essentially abstract. I know of <br>
no limits on the concreteness of concepts. (See Chapter 19, the section The Empiricist <br>
Model of Perception and Cognition: Degrees of Abstraction.)<br>
<br>
Potter’s work shows that more abstract—gist-like and categorizational—representation <br>
is retained more securely than the fullest detail in a rapidly shown sequence of pictures. <br>
However, her work also shows that substantial, concrete pictorial detail is retained. <br>
Moreover, when pictures are presented as indicating search targets before subjects are <br>
exposed to a rapid serial presentation of pictures, memory is consistently better—even <br>
though not dramatically better—than when words designate search targets. This result <br>
suggests that, at least in these situations, pictorial format in the target presentation inter-<br>
faces more quickly and efficiently than verbal format does.935<br>
<br>
Potter takes both verbally expressed representation and “abstract” representation in <br>
pictorial form to be conceptual. She takes only “concrete” representation, always illus-<br>
trated by color and shape representations, to be perceptual. The situation is more complex. <br>
Verbally expressed representation is certainly conceptual. But the abstract-concrete dis-<br>
tinction is too vague and too shared between concepts and percepts to mark a scientific <br>
conceptual-perceptual distinction. Both conceptual and perceptual representation can be <br>
very abstract or very concrete.936 The criticism does not depend on my specific conception <br>
of concepts as functioning to contribute to propositional capacities. There are perhaps <br>
other legitimate uses of the term ‘concept’. The criticism hinges only on taking concepts to <br>
be disjoint from perceptual attributives, which Potter clearly does, and on understanding <br>
perceptual processing. Potter’s mistake lies in underestimating the reach of the perceptual <br>
system, a mistake exposed by empirical work in the 1990s. (See Chapter 10.) Ironically, <br>
Potter’s own work contributed to exposing the mistake.<br><br>
