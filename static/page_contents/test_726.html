smoking-causes-death case. To have the competence, one must have supra-perceptual <br>
inductive or linguistic capacities. Here again, the capacities are almost surely conceptual/<br>
propositional.<br>
<br>
Other cognitive competencies may or may not be propositional. Take tacit knowledge <br>
of a grammar. The competence, standardly called ‘tacit knowledge’, may not be prop os-<br>
ition al. The psychological structures used in recognizing sentences apply to perceivable <br>
particulars—word, phrase, sentence tokens. Attributives used in the competence can <br>
attribute grammatical properties and structures to perceived particulars. These competen-<br>
cies are plausibly cognitive. Both innate and acquired aspects of the competence evolved <br>
later than ordinary perception. The competence involves operations not present in or din-<br>
ary, non-linguistic perception: attributing being a word or sentence, attributing case, <br>
attributing agreement, attributing grammatical word order, attributing grammatical roles <br>
and grammatical structures.1180 Some of what is used in tacit knowledge of a grammar is <br>
linguistic perception. But some of it is plausibly supra-perceptual, even supra-<i>linguistic-<br>
perceptual</i>. Although these structures are attributed to perceivables, they function in <br>
thought and communication, as well as in picking out perceived particulars. At least <br>
recursive operations in the competence are more sophisticated than operations involved <br>
in formation of non-linguistic perceptions. They are plausibly cognitive.<br>
<br>
I do not know whether the competence is propositional. Part of the competence involves <br>
recognizing propositional structures. It seems plausible that recognizing them requires, or <br>
at least is deeply associated with, a capacity to use them. But this principle is not obvious. <br>
Probably, some aspects of grammatical competence are propositional (or constitutively <br>
contribute to propositional competencies), and some are not. Some aspects of learning a <br>
grammar are simply acquisition of statistical probabilities—an operation that occurs in <br>
ordinary perceptual learning and perceptual memory. But there are also op er ations that <br>
differ from anything that occurs in ordinary, non-linguistic perceptual learning. Further <br>
exploration of whether and in what sense such operations are cognitive is needed.1181<br>
<br>
Another set of candidates for being cognitive is a suite of operations on representations <br>
of relations. This suite is discussed under the rubric ‘analogical reasoning’. Analogizing is <br>
often said to be an operation on “higher-order relations”. This phrase is not used as it is used <br>
in philosophy or logic—to designate relations that take other relations as <i>relata</i>. It is used <br>
to include any relations more “abstract” than similarities of color, shape, size, motion.<br>
<br>
Suppose that one picture shows a man on the left giving a package to a woman on the <br>
right, and another picture shows a woman on the right dropping some nuts for a squirrel <br>
on the left.1182 (See Figure 19.1.) The woman’s appearance is similar in the two cases. <br>
Comparing the pictures, however, tends to raise the probability that a viewer focuses on a <br>
common relation—that of giving—with the woman playing different roles in it. Authors <br>
take the relation to be less stimulus-bound, more “abstract” than the most obvious spatial <br>
relations in the two cases. The woman’s role differs. Giving here is not a relation between <br>
relations. It is a relation between perceivable entities. But it is intuitively more abstract <br><br>
