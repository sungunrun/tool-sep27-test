speed, and direction can be completed in less than 100 ms from a single exposure of 25–50 <br>
ms.391 I discuss processing speed in some detail in Chapter 11.<br>
<br>
As processing proceeds, new inputs enter the perceptual system. There may be time <br>
only for a partial analysis of a scene at a given time, because change of input occurs before <br>
a sequence of processing can be completed and some unfinished processing is written over <br>
or forgotten.<br>
<br>
Gestalt psychologists were mistaken in thinking that a perceptual system can, in a single <br>
perception, under the briefest exposure, take in and process to completion all perceptual <br>
input, no matter how rich. Different time exposures are needed for different types of pro-<br>
cessing. Different levels of detail in representation are produced by different types of <br>
processing.<br>
<br>
Some time exposures that are needed to complete some processing tasks last beyond <br>
the interval between saccades. Some processing tasks require specific occurrent input <br>
from one or more types of visual memory. I focus here, and in the next chapter, on visual <br>
perceptions that are formed between, not across, saccades.<br>
<br>
Saccades occur about three times a second in humans. During saccades, there is no vis-<br>
ual perceptual input from the environment. The viewer is momentarily blind. So any visual <br>
processes in humans that integrate information received over periods longer than about <br>
330 ms involve interaction between visual perception and visual memory. Visual memory <br>
must hold the informational and perceptual results of an exposure through a saccade in <br>
order for those results to be integrated with the results of a post-saccadic ex pos ure. As we <br>
shall see, there are also roles for memory well inside the 330 ms window.<br>
<br>
There are several species of attention. Some attention is probably present in nearly all <br>
perception, even the briefest. All forms of attention involve a mechanism for selection of <br>
some information for more thorough processing. Attention often connects perceptual <br>
information with processing by other aspects of the psychology. Understood as the pri-<br>
mary orientation in a perceptual state and perceiver, attention is normally focused on the <br>
central part of the visual field.<br>
<br>
Simply by virtue of differences in acuity across the visual field, some information is bet-<br>
ter focused, more thoroughly resolved, than other information. If selection can consist in <br>
favoring—actively or not—some information in a state, then some attention accompanies <br>
some aspect or some sub-part of virtually every perceptual state. Although in mammals, <br>
attention is commonly directed to the foveal area of the visual field, it can be directed <br>
elsewhere. One can foveate in one area and attend to another. This situation occurs <br>
constantly.<br>
<br>
Attention commonly involves consciousness, at least in mammals. Attention can, how-<br>
ever, operate without consciousness.392 It is perhaps not settled whether consciousness can <br>
occur without attention. A primary reason for lack of a clear answer here is that there is no <br><br>
