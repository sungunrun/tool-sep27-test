W.G. Sebald, <i>The Rings of Saturn<br><br>
</i>In this chapter, I reflect more systematically on the form or structure of perceptual repre-<br>
sentation. The chapter is comprised of eight sections. The first indicates that the structure <br>
of perceptual attribution is more complex than my initial presentation in Chapter 2 sug-<br>
gested. The second argues that individuals always perceive property-instances, or tropes, <br>
not just individuals that instantiate kinds. The third draws consequences of this point for <br>
understanding four types of attribution of properties and kinds. The fourth integrates <br>
these consequences into perceptual attribution of relations. I have so far focused on one-<br>
place attributions: attributions of properties (<i>brown</i>) or kinds (<i>body</i>). Attribution of rela-<br>
tions is central for most perception. The fifth and sixth sections discuss the notion of scope <br>
in perceptual representation. I compare and contrast scope in perception with scope in the <br>
logical forms of propositional representation. I also discuss how scope affects relational as <br>
distinct from non-relational representation (edge versus edge of). The seventh section <br>
centers on absence of logical constants in perceptual representational contents. The eighth <br>
discusses differences between perceptual representational contents and the sorts of noun <br>
phrases with which they share a basic structure.<br>
<br>
The point of the semantical theorizing is to begin to systematize what is known about <br>
perceptual structure and perceptual reference using techniques of formal semantics. <br>
I believe that this sort of theorizing clarifies commitments already present in scientific <br>
accounts of perceptual representation, and makes explicit how perceptual states represent.<br><br>

<b>Review of Basic Form of Perceptual Representation<br><br>
</div>
</b>In Chapter 2, I outlined the structure of representations and representational contents for <br>
perceptual states. I did so in the most idealized, simplified way possible. I characterized <br>
the structure as nominal. The structure of perceptual states is shared by noun phrases <br>
 governed by demonstratives. Perceptual structure is not linguistic structure. The same <br>
nom in al, noun-phrase-like, structure can be realized in language, thought, or perception. <br>
I think that this noun-phrase-like structure appears first in perception and later shows up <br>
in language.<br>
<br>
I identified three basic structural elements in perceptual representation and percep-<br>
tual representational content. One is perceptual referential application. In our symbolic </div>
