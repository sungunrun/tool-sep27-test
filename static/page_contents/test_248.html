<b>Referential Applications in Accuracy Conditions for Tracking Particulars<br><br>
</div>
</b>One of the most important instances of a pair of identity statements that conforms to <br>
Frege’s strategy for arguing for a difference between sense and <i>Bedeutung</i> is<br><br>
(a΄-a΄) that1 body is identical with that1 body<br><br>
(considered as in effect an apriori logical truth, given the empirical assumption that the <br>
demonstrative succeeds in referring), and<br><br>
(a΄-b΄) that1 body is identical with that2 body,<br><br>
considered as true, but not such an apriori logical truth. An (a΄-b΄) statement could be <br>
false, even assuming that both applications of the demonstrative have a referent. The <br>
analog of Frege’s point about (a-a) and (a-b) is that where (a΄-a΄) and (a΄-b΄) are both <br>
true, they have different representational contents, although the singular terms share a <br>
referent.<br>
<br>
Often, when <i>linguistic</i> statements of the form (a΄-b΄) are true, there are unarticulated <br>
differences in how the body looks on two sides of the identity sign. Such differences are <br>
not necessary for the form to occur. At bottom, the difference in subscripts marking differ-<br>
ent referential applications signifies fallibility as to whether there are two referents or one. <br>
(a΄-a΄) has the content that body is identical with itself. In this case, it is not possible for <br>
there to be different referents. (a΄-b΄) has a content that is fallible, even assuming referen-<br>
tial success.<br>
<br>
Imagine that a subject in an experiment is told that there are two visually indiscernible <br>
spherical objects that will be shown against a contrasting background. Sometimes the same <br>
object is shown twice. Sometimes the first object is replaced by the second after a temporal <br>
interval. The individual is told to make judgments or guesses of sameness or difference. The <br>
individual is told to affirm or deny statements of the form (a΄-b΄), correlating the first <br>
demonstrative application with the appearance of an object accompanied by a first light <br>
flash and the second demonstrative application with the appearance of an object ac com-<br>
pan ied by a second flash. The subject is told that either the same object or the different <br>
object is presented at the second flash. At first, the task is made easy, because the individual <br>
is given cues in replacement cases—such as a hand removing the first object and another <br>
hand replacing it with the second object. As the experiment proceeds, succession cues drop <br>
out. Eventually, the individual is making forced guesses. The flashes can be taken to occur in <br>
a specious present. Throughout, some (a΄-b΄) statements are true; some are false.232<br>
<br>
The example is, of course, intended to evoke object tracking, a special case of object <br>
constancy. A case of object constancy involving tracking is simulated in multiple-object-<br>
tracking paradigms. Several indiscernible discs move in complex ways, sometimes behind <br>
obstacles. Tracking 5 or more objects can be difficult or impossible, even at slow speeds.233<br><br>
