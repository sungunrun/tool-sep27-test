Scope and Modificational Attribution Hierarchy 189</div>
<br><br>
The body attributive is basically nominal, not modificational. Categorization is its main <br>
use. In our psychologies, cubical and red are not fundamentally nominal nor categoriza-<br>
tional. The attributive surface seems, like body, to be basically nominal. It marks a compe-<br>
tence to categorize. It is associated with an attributive surface-of that indicates a relation <br>
between surfaces and further things. Thus there is a pair of surface attribution competen-<br>
cies—surface and surface-of.<br>
<br>
The scope of reference guided by body is not always dominant. When it is not dom in-<br>
ant, it appears to have a kind of modificational role. It seems in effect to qualify the more <br>
dominantly indicated attribute and attribute-instance. The question arises whether, to <br>
account for “modificational” attributions of <i>body</i>, we should postulate a relational body <br>
attributive, x embodied-by y perhaps, that is analogous to the relational surface at tribu tive. <br>
I think that the answer is ‘no’. It may be interesting to see why.<br>
<br>
Let us return to the two cases that we have already discussed in which the body at tribu-<br>
tive occurs in a representational content, but is not scope-dominant:<br><br>
(that x1)[(that x2)(body(i)(x2), surface-of(c)(x1, x2), surface(i)(x1))]<br><br>
(that x1)[(that x2)(body(i)(x2), cubical(c)(x2), cubical(i)(x1))].<br><br>
In the first case, we might produce a relational body attributive by saying ‘that1 surface <br>
embodied-by that2 body’. In the second, we might say ‘that1 instance of <i>cubical</i> embodied by <br>
that2 body’. It seems to me, however, that these are just rephrasings of the forms that we already <br>
have. Surface x1 is embodied-by body x2 if and only if surface x1 is surface-of body x2. Similarly <br>
for the shape case (and for a parallel color case). I see no perceptual use that outruns these <br>
points and that would reveal a perceptual difference between the different phrasings.<br>
<br>
To see bodies, we must see them by seeing their surfaces and shapes. There is no <br>
other way. Even when surfaces and shapes are psychologically primary and referential <br>
applications to them are scope-dominant over referential applications to bodies, they <br>
are still seen as aspects of bodies. Bodies are not, strictly, seen as aspects of them. Or if <br>
they are, it is merely a matter of focusing on them while retaining vision of them as <br>
modifying bodies.<br>
<br>
So scope dominance, which is a matter of contextual psychological priority, and dom in-<br>
ance in a hierarchy of modificational attribution are separable. In perceptual systems that <br>
have body attributives, bodies are at the top of the modificational hierarchy. They are cat-<br>
egorized, and all other attributions that concern bodies figure in modifying them. That <br>
status remains even when they are not the primary focus of attention, memory, or action. <br>
It remains even though surfaces and edges are also categorized. Scope is contextual. <br>
Attributional categorization and modification are ability-general and structural.<br>
<br>
Being only intra-attribute attributed, and not cross-attribute attributed, is neither <br>
ne ces sary nor sufficient for being the scope-highlighted category, or for being psy cho-<br>
logic ally primary. In the case, set off above, in which the shape attributive’s application is <br>
scope-dominant, the attribute <i>cubical</i> is cross-attribute attributed as well as intra-attribute <br>
at tri buted. So being only intra-attribute attributed is not necessary for represented in a <br>
scope dominant way. In the case in which the <i>surface</i> attributive’s application is scope-<br>
dominant, the attribute <i>body</i> is only intra-attribute attributed. So being only intra-attribute <br>
attributed is not sufficient for being scope dominant.</div>
