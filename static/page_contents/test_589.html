Visual Working Memory 589</div>

cognitive operations on working memory make <i>it</i> active. Working memory is open by its <br>
nature to operations on it. Some of what it retains is propositional.872<br>
<br>
There is no evidence that retention of perceptual representation depends, in dis pens-<br>
ably, on supra-perceptual powers or conceptual powers, much less that supra-perceptual-<br>
level representation in working memory is part of the same computational system with <br>
the perceptual contents in working memory.<br>
<br>
Although it is common among both scientists and philosophers to count working <br>
memory as “cognitive” or conceptual without qualification, working memory that func-<br>
tions to retain perceptual representation does not operate at a higher representational <br>
level than perception does. In scientific accounts of it, the format is iconic, and there is no <br>
appeal to propositional capacities. <i>Perceptual working memory</i> is working memory that <br>
functions to retain perceptual contents. Non-symbolic <i>perceptual</i> VWM is an auxiliary <br>
system serving perception and conation. Its content derives from perception. Its op er-<br>
ation al mechanisms are, if anything, less complex than perception-forming operations. <br>
Thus there is a perceptual-level of working memory.<br>
<br>
This is not to say that non-symbolic perceptual-level VWM does not interact with cog-<br>
nitive or conceptual causes. Its contents can be affected by planned conceptual strategies. <br>
Its coding and perhaps retention can be affected by conceptual attention commands. There <br>
is surely interaction between perceptual and conceptual contents, for example in concep-<br>
tualization and formation of perceptual belief.873 These natural interactions do not render <br>
perception cognitive or conceptual. Nor do they entail that there is no perceptual-level <br>
type of working memory or that this type is not a part of the larger visual and visuo-motor <br>
perceptual level system. This point is parallel to points made about conation, attention, <br>
and the executive control system in Chapters 14 and 15.<br>
<br>
The operation of retention itself is certainly not supra-perceptual. The retained contents <br>
are perceptual contents. There is no evidence that retention of perceptual contents in non-<br>
linguistic perceptual VWM depends indispensably on interaction with conceptual con-<br>
tents. More importantly, there is not a trace of evidence that computational explanations <br>
of retention of perceptual contents appeal to cognitive or conceptual input into the com-<br>
putations. I take these facts to support the idea that perceptual working memory is an <br>
aspect of a large psychological kind—the visual and visuo-motor perceptual-level systems.<br>
<br>
Neural evidence suggests a similar conclusion. Brain areas that support initial retention <br>
of perceptual representation in working memory tend to be the same areas in which the <br>
perception was initially processed. Areas associated with perceptually representing the left <br>
side of a scene are associated with retaining in working memory the perceptual represen-<br>
tation of the same scene-side. More generally, detailed cortical field maps underlying per-<br>
ceptual representation have counterparts for visual working memory. More strikingly, <br>
attributives for low-level visual attributes, such as simple shapes and orientation are <br>
formed and retained in V4 and MT (the medial temporal area). That is, the storage of <br><br>

<b>FN</b>872 I think that perceptual beliefs—which involve conceptualizations of perceptual contents, making direct <br>
use of perceptual modes of presentation and adding no non-perceptual attributives—can be retained in non-<br>
symbolic working memory. Inasmuch as it retains conceptual contents, VWM has a conceptual, hence cognitive <br>
aspect. This matter has not been studied with clarity and care. The initial representational content retained in <br>
visual working memory is perceptual.<br>
