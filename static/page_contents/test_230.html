230 Attributives, Referential Applications in Constancies</div>

example, in computing length, a perceptual system may use cues from perceptual memory <br>
about how long an edge typically is, when the edge representation is computed from a ret-<br>
inal image of a certain specific retinal shape. Or it might rely on other statistical cues <br>
derived from retinal sizes and shapes.<br>
<br>
The fact that there are many cues for length beyond those for distance and orientation <br>
helps show why one cannot cash out the perspectival aspects of attribution of length <br>
purely in terms of further attributions of distance and orientation. Perspective, hence ways <br>
of representing, hence attributives, all vary with types of cues that generate the attribu-<br>
tions. Since there are many types of cues for attribution of any property, kind, or relation, <br>
there are many attributives that indicate any property, kind, or relation. Each provides a <br>
different perspective on the indicated attribute.<br>
<br>
So the iconic spatial coordinate system in visual perceptual representation is computed <br>
from different cues on different occasions. Some parts of the system are computed from <br>
different cues, at different speeds, and with different degrees of specificity, from other <br>
parts. The coordinate system is not all perfectly determinate or even always perfectly <br>
mathematically coherent. It is the product of many local computations applied to different <br>
parts of the perceptual field. Local computations of attributives for non-relational, non-<br>
perspectival properties, like edge length and surface size or body size, are produced from a <br>
variety of cues that commonly include the cues from which accompanying perspectival, <br>
relational attributives for relational properties, like orientation and distance, are com-<br>
puted. But the cues for non-relational and relational representations need not be, and <br>
commonly are not, exactly the same. In producing a spatial coordinate system of represen-<br>
tation, the perceptual system may, in certain cases, discount certain cues, or make com-<br>
promises between computations of relational attributives and computations of <br>
non-relational attributives for non-relational properties of the <i>relata</i> that occur in the rela-<br>
tions indicated by the relational attributives. So the perspectival, proprietary representa-<br>
tion of a non-relational, perspective-independent property, like a specific length, does not <br>
reside wholly in computations that produce representations for current distance and <br>
orientation.<br>
<br>
The fact that visual perceptual attributives for non-relational, perspective-independent <br>
properties like length and shape are computed from a variety of cues that vary with stimu-<br>
lus conditions is incompatible with minimalism. For perceptual attributives—attributive <br>
ways of representing—<i>just are</i> psychological capacities that contribute in psychologically <br>
distinctive ways to the composition of perceptual states. Different cues, or cue sets, gener-<br>
ate psychologically distinct states, or state components, that attribute the same properties <br>
or relations in psychologically distinct ways. Psychological distinctiveness is empirically <br>
detectable, even measurable. Psychological states for attributing a given non-relational, <br>
environmental property <i>P</i> that are computed in different ways, from different cue sets, will <br>
differ in speed of formation, speed in causing responses, degrees of reliability in being <br>
accurate, and often in phenomenology. The differences in cue-sets for computing repre-<br>
sentation of a given non-relational property <i>P</i> cannot in general be correlated, in any sim-<br>
ple way, with differences in other properties or relations that are represented along with <br>
the representation of <i>P</i>. For example, in representing a specific surface shape, any different <br>
combination of cues from retinal shape, specularities, retinal lightness shadings, retinal <br>
texture patterns, other statistical properties of the retinal image, cues for binocular dispar-<br>
ity, cues for convergence, and so on, will yield a different perceptual attributive that </div>
