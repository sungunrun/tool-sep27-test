284 Egocentric Indexing</div>
<br><br>
Two conclusions follow. First, the memory state is temporally indexed to the past—or <br>
past-tensed. It necessarily functions to represent the past. To capture its representational <br>
function and the competence that it exercises, one must take its representational content <br>
to represent the past. One must take the perceptual state to be indexed to the present, to <br>
capture its contrasting representational function and competence.<br>
<br>
Here is a more specific way to recognize the same point. The memory can share with <br>
the initial perceptual state some or all referential applications that function to pick out <br>
perceived particulars. The occurrences of such referential applications in the memory can <br>
be anaphorically connected to counterpart occurrences in the retained perception. So <br>
they count as the same applications. The perceptual attributives in the perception could <br>
also be preserved in the memory. Suppose that there is only the color attributive. (Actually, <br>
I think that, inevitably, there is more than one color attributive, at different levels of speci-<br>
ficity—at least the generic color and the attributive for a specific color or color shade.) <br>
Assume that the color attributive is retained. To capture the representational difference <br>
between the perception and its memory, they must be taken to represent time differently. <br>
The perception indexes its attributive(s) to the time of the anchoring now schema. The <br>
memory indexes its own present time. So to account for the veridicality conditions of the <br>
perception and its memory, it is necessary to postulate temporal elements in their contents.<br>
<br>
Here are forms of the perception, its memory, and the use state, for the example at hand:<br><br>
Visual Perception:<br>
<br>
(nowego t1)(that xa1)(redr6(i)(x1), at(c)(x1, t1))<br><br>
Visual Memory:<br>
<br>
(nowego t2)(then tf1)(that xa1)(redr6 (i)(x1), at(c)(x1, t1), past(c)(tf1, t2))<br><br>
Conative State:<br>
<br>
(nowego t2)(that xa2)(avoid(c)(xa2), redr6 (i)(xa2), at(c)(xa2, t2))<br><br>
Key points to notice. The visual perception and the memory state share a referential <br>
application (that xa1) to the red trope. The memory’s application is anaphorically con-<br>
nected to the perceptual state’s application. The conative state’s referential application to <br>
the trope (that xa2) is different. It functions to track the application in the perceptual state <br>
and its memory. But its referential application is not anaphorically tied to that application. <br>
The trope is event-like and is tagged to a time by at(c). At(c) is accurate of a trope if and only <br>
if the trope occurs at the time it is tagged to. Past(c)(t1, t2) is accurate of times t1, t2, if and <br>
only if t1 is past with respect to t2. The visual memory that retains the visual perception is <br>
formed soon after the visual perception. The memory tracks the (now past) present time <br>
of the visual perception t1 with (then tf1). The conative state commands the act of avoid-<br>
ance of the trope perceptually referred to by (that xa2). Perhaps with the simple creature, <br>
there is a single such act—close shell, or move. It is important that the conative state retain <br>
minimum perceptual guidance, here through the attributive for <i>red</i>. There are many issues <br>
about action representation that I take up in Chapter 12. Here I assume only that the com-<br>
mand specifies some act and that the act is guided by perception of some particular.<br>
<br>
Again, I take the short-term visual memory to maintain representational connection <br>
back to the indexed time of the visual perception that it retains. A perceptual memory </div>
