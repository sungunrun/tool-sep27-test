<b>Supra-Perceptual Effects on Perceptual-Level Operations: An Example<br><br>
</div>
</b>I conclude this chapter with an example that illustrates how supra-perceptual-level atten-<br>
tional initiations affect perceptual-level attention commands and other states and op er-<br>
ations in the visuomotor system.<br>
<br>
Let us assume that x-ray machine is not a perceptual attributive. Let us assume that <br>
there are conceptual attributives for typical sizes and shapes of x-ray machines. Let us <br>
assume that there are conceptual attributives not only in symbolic, non-iconic form, but <br>
also conceptual attributives in iconic form whose contents derive from perceptual attribu-<br>
tives. Suppose that one wants and intends to study x-ray machines. These first motivating <br>
conative states specify x-ray machines as such. Suppose that one hears someone say that <br>
an x-ray machine is to the left. Suppose that one believes what one hears. One’s wanting <br>
and one’s belief are propositional attitudes that employ the concept x-ray machine. Those <br>
states are associated in one’s background knowledge with memories and beliefs about the <br>
shape and size of x-ray machines. Some of these background states may use iconic con-<br>
cepts for these sizes and shapes and for bodies of relevant sizes and shapes. All these <br>
propositional attitudes—from those that specify x-ray machines as such to the most <br>
primi tive beliefs, intentions, and anticipations that make use of iconic perceptually derived <br>
concepts—are associated in the psychology with perceptual anticipations as of x-ray-<br>
machine-shaped x-ray-machine-bodies. The wants and beliefs trigger perceptual attention <br>
via perceptual-level attention commands in one’s visual search, guided by perceptual <br>
anticipations as of such bodies. They may trigger conceptual-level attention commands <br>
that trigger perceptual-level attention commands. Suppose that the effects of these <br>
en dogen ous perceptual-level attention commands occur <i>during</i> perceptual processing. So <br>
in turning left and seeking an x-ray machine, one’s propositional attitudes activate an <br>
attention command and a perceptual-attention-highlighted perceptual anticipation as of a <br>
body of the relevant shape and size: Attend: that x-ray-machine-shaped-sized x-ray-<br>
machine-body to the left, with schematic that, not yet applied. The shift of perceptual <br>
attention caused by the command affects one’s perceptual set and the selection of resources <br>
in perceptual processing.<br>
<br>
No one studying vision could ever have reasonably doubted that such sequences occur. <br>
Even their occurring during later (post 140–160 ms) perceptual processing is not a revela-<br>
tion that affects basic forms of scientific explanation. Computational explanations center <br>
on these late perceptual-level stages. Propositional antecedents are not inputs in the com-<br>
putational processing, at least as far as current computational modeling goes. We have <br>
other explanations of how and why propositional attitudes impact allocations of attention <br>
within visuomotor processing. Biased competition in the perceptual system is directly <br>
 initiated and guided by <i>representational</i> perceptual-level capacities, which may or may not <br>
be caused by conceptual-level attention commands or background attitudes. Standard <br>
computational models explain perceptual attention and its direct representational ante-<br>
cedents (here, attentional commands) in non-propositional, perceptual-level terms. The </div>
