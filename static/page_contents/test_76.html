76 perceptual constancy</div>
<br><br>
Wherever there is a filtering process, various sorts of sensory registrations of inputs are <br>
grouped in equivalence classes. These classes are “constant”, or invariant, over various <br>
proximal sensory inputs. ‘Perceptual constancy’ is not applied so liberally in perceptual <br>
psychology. What grounds the idea that perceptual constancies constitute an important <br>
psychological kind?<br>
<br>
In confronting these questions, it can be assumed that perceptual science <i>does</i> distin-<br>
guish between ordinary sensory invariances and perceptual constancies. There tends to be <br>
agreement on cases. Lack of a general criterion is not surprising, hence no ground for <br>
doubting the distinction. The practice of the science in distinguishing cases and in apply-<br>
ing causal explanations in terms of states with veridicality conditions to some sensory <br>
states and not to others is consistent enough to ground firm belief that the deflationist <br>
position is mistaken.<br><br>

<b>Efference Copy: An Example of a Non-Perceptual Invariance<br><br>
</div>
</b>I turn to a phenomenon that might generate temptation to regard a certain mechanism in <br>
sensing motion as objectification. Resisting temptation will sharpen understanding. An <br>
animal’s movements can interfere with its sensing the environment. They can cause sen-<br>
sory input that matches input caused by external movements. In moves to the right, visual <br>
input tends to match that which occurs when an animal remains still, but the scene moves <br>
to the left. In simple organisms, tactile input from initiating eating can be in dis tin guish-<br>
able from tactile input that occurs when the organism bumps into something. The organ-<br>
ism must distinguish different situations that are not distinguished in the sensory input <br>
from the environment. A widespread mechanism that solves such problems is for corollar-<br>
ies of motor commands to be routed to the sensory system. Such corollaries, called <br>
 ‘<i>efference copy</i>’, influence sensory processing.69<br>
<br>
Efference copy was studied in the nineteenth century to help explain how, despite fre-<br>
quent eye movements, the human visual system does not present the world as jumping <br>
around. Efference copy also figures in some perceptual constancies. It is a factor in size <br>
constancy. Feedback from movement of the muscles that control the lenses helps deter-<br>
mine distance, hence also size. Efference-copy signals that derive from endogenous action <br>
commands are fed into the visual system and affect motion constancy.70<br>
<br>
The visual system uses many cues to determine distance, size, and speed. The contribu-<br>
tion of proprioceptive signals to perceptual estimates of size is small.71 However, efference <br>
copy plays a role in several perceptual constancies.<br><br>
