A Computational Construal of Modularity 709</div>
<br><br>
Computational explanations are and should be prized when they work. Perhaps more <br>
of them will be made to work in domains of psychology outside perceptual-level systems. <br>
There are approximations to computational explanations that allow for open-endedness at <br>
some junctures.1161<br>
<br>
It remains remarkable that computational explanations of perceptual-level states do not <br>
need to postulate propositional attitudes as input on which computations operate. Such <br>
explanations are impressively successful. I think that this explanatory difference with non-<br>
computational explanations marks a difference in psychological kinds. Even if at some <br>
deep level, propositional attitude psychology were to be computational, the difference in <br>
complexity, representational functions, and types of patterns involved, would be so dra-<br>
matic that the relations between types of computational explanation would signal an <br>
important difference in psychological level and kind. As I have repeatedly emphasized, <br>
formal, functional, and competency differences distinguish propositional from perceptual-<br>
level capacities. The differences hold independently of whether propositional networks are <br>
eventually found to be computational.<br>
<br>
I forego pursuing most of the issues raised here. I return to the question whether cur-<br>
rent computational explanations that do not postulate propositional attitudes as elements <br>
in computations could be easily supplemented in the science so as to yield explanatory <br>
insight.<br>
<br>
Suppose that a subject has a perceptual belief that a red square shape occurs in a certain <br>
quadrant and a propositional-level intention to localize the red square. Suppose that this <br>
belief and an appropriate intention-command causes (a) a perceptual attention command <br>
to bias toward, or select, perceptual representation that foveates the quadrant, and (b) a <br>
perceptual-level anticipation of redness and squareness. Suppose that the propositional <br>
attitudes have an ongoing effect on sub-propositional attention and anticipation, thereby <br>
indirectly affecting perceptual processing—in the ways that perceptual-level attention and <br>
anticipation can.<br>
<br>
<i>Actual</i> computational explanation of such a case starts with input from the non-foveal <br>
perception as of a red square, the perceptual-level attention command, and the perceptual-<br>
level anticipation. Why should they not be supplemented to include these states’ <i>immediate</i> <br>
propositional antecedents? Would one not then avoid the complexities of non-<br>
demonstrative reasoning and individual differences, and yet gain a fuller causal account?<br>
<br>
I think that science does not include such minimal extensions in its computational <br>
explanations because such extensions would not be illuminatingly explanatory in a sys-<br>
tematic way. The explanation of the perceptual and motor processing does not need them. <br>
They provide contextually useful explanatory additions. However, loading them into a <br>
computational explanation is <i>ad hoc</i>. I think that there are at least three bases for this <br>
judgment.<br>
<br>
First, there are no computational algorithms between intention/belief pairs and atten-<br>
tion commands or motor commands. There are indefinitely many circumstances in which <br>
such a pair will not cause them, perhaps because further beliefs or intentions block follow-<br>
through. So one would have to stipulate that a relevant intention/belief pair in fact gets <br><br>
