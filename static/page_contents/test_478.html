478 Primitive Attribution of Causation, Agency</div>

objects; instruments, by instrumental constructions. In English several of these structural <br>
relations tend to be marked by prepositions proprietary to the relation. For example, in <br>
passive constructions, agents are marked by ‘by’; locations by ‘along’, ‘into’, ‘onto’, ‘over’, ‘to’, <br>
‘toward’, and so on; beneficiaries by ‘for’ or ‘to’; instruments, by ‘with’.<br>
<br>
I conjecture that pre-linguistic representation of agency and agency-structure are taken <br>
over whole and given propositional form by basic structures in human languages. A lesser <br>
but still prominent presence in early language use is causation, marked by causatives. <br>
Causation and agency are central elements in the forms of earliest linguistic <br>
representation.<br>
<br>
Let me summarize the key structural factors in early agency representation. First, per-<br>
ceptual attribution of a specific type of motion or a specific shape in bodies is often associ-<br>
ated with functional anticipations. Such attributions and anticipations often correspond to <br>
certain types of <i>agency</i> and <i>agents</i>. An individual’s representational system relies on shape <br>
attributives and motion attributives to trigger agent attributives and agency attributives. It <br>
is plausible that the functional anticipations are generated at the perceptual level. However, <br>
the matter has not been adequately investigated, and computational models have not been <br>
developed sufficiently, to justify confidence that these simplest attributions of agency are <br>
perceptual.<br>
<br>
The relational factors—an act’s having a target, being by an agent, in a place or along a <br>
path, directed toward a theme, perhaps for a beneficiary or with an instrument—are the <br>
most basic structural elements in primitive representation of agency. They are all asym-<br>
metrical relations. Individuals learn to attach types of agency with types of agents.<br>
<br>
I conjecture that each of these structural elements is indicated by attributives in percep-<br>
tual systems of higher animals and infants. Computation of such attributives does not <br>
seem more complex than computation of other relational attributives that are known to <br>
occur in perceptual systems. But again, computational models have not been developed. <br>
Such development is a primary ground for determining whether attributives are percep-<br>
tual or supra-perceptual.<br>
<br>
Here is an example of what might be the representational form of a perceptual repre-<br>
sentation of an instance of agency:<br><br>
(here-cego x0)(that x1)(that x2)(that x3)(that x4)(that x5)(that x6)<br>
<br>
[human-bodyd1(i)(x1), human-shapeb1(c)(x1), human-shapeb1(i)(x5), agenth1(i)(x1), <br>
<br>
movementm6(i)(x2),<br>
<br>
actq1(i)(x2), chasingr1(i)(x2), by(c)(x2, x1), fromx6(c)(x2, p1, p2, x0),<br>
<br>
pig-bodyd2(i)(x3), pig-shapeb7(c)(x3), pig-shapeb7(i)(x6), agenth2(i)(x3), movementm4(i)(x4), <br>
<br>

<br>
fleeingt6(i)(x4), target-objectd8(c)(x3, x2), byz5(c)(x4, x3), fromx9(c)(x4, p3, p4, x0)].<br><br>
Read: that movement-act of chasing by that human-shaped human-body agent from <br>
position p1 to position p2, with respect to ego-here, of that pig-shaped pig-body agent in <br>
that movement act of fleeing from position p3 to position p4, with respect to ego-here. <br>
The English omits referential applications to the shapes and shape tropes. The formaliza-<br>
tion omits temporal representation.<br>
<br>
I assume that each referred-to body is identical with an agent, and that each referred-to <br>
movement is identical with an act. The formalization omits iconic plotting of shapes and AQ:2</div>
