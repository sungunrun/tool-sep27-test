analogized to a spotlight and was regarded as a top-down supplement to bottom-up oper-<br>
ations in the visual system. The supplement was taken to be normally needed to yield rep-<br>
resentation of particulars that have more than one attribute-dimension and occur in <br>
3-D space.<br>
<br>
From the beginning, however, Treisman maintained that there are three ways in which <br>
features in different dimensions can be bound.425 One is through application of attention. <br>
A second is through the system’s anticipating presence of a specific type of object and fit-<br>
ting features from different dimensions into ‘predicted object frames’.426 A third is through <br>
random, perhaps noise-based, combination in the absence of attention.<br>
<br>
Initial, seemingly powerful, empirical support for the two-stage theory came from <br>
timed visual search tasks. Subjects were shown a display involving various items. Subjects <br>
were timed to make present-absent responses regarding whether a predefined item is pre-<br>
sent in the display. On a randomized half of the trials, a target item was present along with <br>
one or more non-target items. In the remainder of the trials, the target item was not pre-<br>
sent at all. Although the size of the display frame remained constant, display size was <br>
defined as the number of items contained in the display. This number varied over the <br>
 trials. The main results of interest are measures of reaction time and accuracy, in relation <br>
to the number of display items.<br>
<br>
Experiments used two types of visual search task: <i>feature search</i> and <i>conjunction search</i>. <br>
The following experiments illustrate the difference. Colored letters were presented in a <br>
display. In the feature search task, the features targeted as search items were the color <i>blue</i> <br>
and the letter-shape <i>S</i>. The non-target distractor items were green <i>X</i>s and brown <i>T</i>s. So, <br>
four tokens of two types of target. The blue type of target could be tokened in a blue <i>X</i> or a <br>
blue <i>T.</i> The letter-shape-<i>S</i> type of target could be tokened in a green <i>S</i> or a brown <i>S.</i> In <br>
conjunction search, the same non-target distractors were used. The target was a green <br>
<i>T</i>. Conjunction was between greenness and <i>T</i>-ness. In both kinds of search tasks, the dis-<br>
play contained either 1, 5, 15, or 30 display items.427<br>
<br>
The first key result was as follows. In conjunction searches, search times increased lin-<br>
ear ly with the number of non-target, distractor items. In feature searches, search times <br>
were not affected by increases in the number of non-target distractor items.428 For example, <br>
the response time required to detect one feature (for example, <i>blue</i> or <i>S-shape</i>) did not <br>
increase as the number of features to be searched, including distractors and instances of <br>
the target feature, increased. The fact that detection times in feature searches did not <br>
increase with more distractors was taken to support postulating a parallel, pre-attentive <br>
processing stage in which features are automatically registered and pop out from the dis-<br>
play. In fact, a fairly flat search time with increase in display size became a hallmark of <br><br>

428 This statement oversimplifies. From the outset, Treisman and colleagues explored differences in search <br>
times for features that do depend on display size. They showed that such differences depend on the features’ dis-<br>
criminability. Distractors not easily discriminable from targets tended to slow detection times. These facts per-<br>
sist ent ly complicated the simple “headline” version of the theory, and remained a source of ferment. Since the <br>
increased search times are not linear, Treisman was able to hold onto the claim of a qualitative difference between <br>
feature searches and conjunction searches. She also claimed that determining the exact spatial location of a fea-<br>
ture depends on locating it, through attention, on the master map. See Treisman and Gelade, ‘A Feature-<br>
