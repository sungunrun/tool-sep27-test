can cue agency representation.611 From birth, infants and many animals distinguish <br>
motion of inert bodies, “Newtonian motion”, from biological motion.612<br>
<br>
Subjects represent agent and agency via perception only by perceiving characteristic <br>
shapes or motions. Shape, motion, and agency are all prevalent in the environment. <br>
Representing agency is a richer competence than representing body-shapes and biological <br>
motion. To have a perception-based representation for agency (perceptual or conceptual), <br>
one must not only have the shape-or motion competence. One must have further compe-<br>
tencies that differentiate the agency representation from the representations of shaped-<br>
body and the representations of motion. What are the further competencies?<br>
<br>
They are different anticipations of motions and different emotional or actional uptakes. <br>
An individual’s reacting with fear or avoidance to a spider shape is probably best explained <br>
as taking the shape to be associated with a dangerous agent, especially if the shape <br>
responses are coordinated with biological motion responses. So motion anticipation and <br>
fear ground representation of the spider-shaped spider-body as a dangerous agent. Such <br>
anticipation is not constitutively associated with representation of the shape or shaped <br>
body <i>per se</i>. If the individual had a later perception that showed the spider-shape to be <br>
that of a rock, the spider-shape perception would be retained; but the representation of it <br>
as a spider-body agent and as dangerous would lapse.<br>
<br>
From birth, infants respond to some shapes, like shapes of faces or shapes of snakes and <br>
spiders, in relevant ways. By 4 months at latest, they respond not only to biological motion <br>
patterns but also to endogenously caused motion. They connect both to appropriate func-<br>
tional upshots.613<br>
<br>
Given the evident connection of such responses to agency, infants are reasonably taken <br>
to attribute not only specific types of shape, shaped body, and motion, but also agency. The <br>
shapes and motions trigger both body representations and agency representations.<br>
<br>
Some literature that I cite centers on animacy attribution not agency attribution. <br>
Evidence used to support taking an individual to attribute animacy is, I think, often actu-<br>
ally evidence for agency attribution. Sometimes, no distinction is made. A cue for animacy <br><br>
