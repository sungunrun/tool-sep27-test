462 Primitive Attribution of Causation, Agency</div>
<br><br>
I have discussed unpersuasive arguments for and against taking primitive representa-<br>
tion of mechanical causation to be perceptual. Further evidence has been thought relevant.<br>
<br>
Rolfs, Dembacher, and Cavanagh showed that, after subjects’ extended viewing of colli-<br>
sion events, adaptation occurs.602 Subjects were exposed to various collision-relevant <br>
cases. Some were clear collision events. Others involved one moving disc overlapping a <br>
second and stopping, before the second disc started moving in the same direction and <br>
speed as the first. Depending on the degree of overlap between the discs and when the <br>
second disc starts moving, these initial events appear either causal or noncausal. When <br>
there is little overlap, the first disc appears to launch the second’s motion. When there is <br>
large overlap, the first disc appears to slip over or under the second; and the second appears <br>
stationary. Then there is no causal impression of collision or launching.603 Subjects’ spe-<br>
cific causal or non-causal impressions were plotted against degree of overlap, to determine <br>
the degree that is equally likely to produce a causal or non-causal impression.<br>
<br>
The subjects were next exposed to 320 clear-cut collision events. This prolonged ex pos-<br>
ure was intended to produce adaptation. Then the subjects were again shown events ran-<br>
ging from clear collision events to strongly overlapping, non-causal events. Their specific <br>
causal or non-causal impressions were again plotted against the degree of overlap. A strong <br>
shift emerged. Events that were earlier taken to be ambiguous were taken to be non-causal. <br>
Events that were taken to be causal, but close to the overlap threshold for being non-causal, <br>
were taken to be ambiguous. See Figure 12.4.<br>
<br>
Control experiments were run to rule out explaining the results in terms of adaptation <br>
to visual features other than causal ones. Non-causal features included timing relations, <br>
the number of discs, spatio-temporal contiguity, direction and speed of motion, the area <br>
covered by the events. Contrary to effects of adaptation to collision cases, adaptation to <br>
these non-causal aspects of slip-over cases yielded little or no effect on subjects’ reports. <br>
The authors concluded that perceptual changes after exposure to the many clear-cut colli-<br>
sion events were not caused by adaptation to visible attributes shared by collision and slip <br>
cases. Adaptation was specific to spatio-temporal features whose perception provides an <br>
application base for representing causation.<br>
<br>
The authors took the main significance of these results to depend on a final experiment. <br>
This experiment showed the adaptation effects to depend on the area of the retina on which <br>
the stimuli from adaptation fall. The authors took the adaptation to retinal area to support <br>
taking the adaptation to cause a shift in a perceptual, not higher-level, “cognitive” boundary.<br><br>

<b>FOOTNOTES</b><br>
<b>Cont FN</b>is known. Butterfill claims that representing causation disambiguates a natural ambiguity in perceiving collisions. <br>
The ambiguity is supposed to be between one object’s passing over another and one object’s launching another. <br>
Because of visual systems’ precision in tracking patterns of deletion along bodies’ forward contours, ambiguities <br>
of the sort Butterfill invokes occur only rarely (in the case of very specific body-shapes). See B. Scholl and <br>
Z. Pylyshyn, ‘Tracking Multiple Items Through Occlusion: Clues to Visual Objecthood’, <i>Cognitive Psychology</i> 38 <br>
(1999), 259–290; E. Cheries, L. Feigenson, B. Scholl, and S. Carey, ‘Cues to Object Persistence in Infancy: Tracking <br>
Objects Through Occlusion vs. Implosion’, <i>Journal of Vision</i> 5 (2010), 352. Such occurrences are so rare in natural <br>
scenes that they are not a major disambiguation problem for the visual system. It is, of course, an empirical ques-<br>
tion how to individuate systems as “one and the same”. Even granting that body-tracking and representation of <br>
causation occur in of the visual system, the developmental facts suggest that the former is in place earlier than <br>
the latter, and does not need the latter to operate. There <i>is</i> evidence that the types of representation interact once <br>
both are in place. See S. Kim, J. Feldman, and M. Singh, ‘Perceived Causality Can Alter the Trajectory of Apparent <br>
Motion’, <i>Psychological Science</i> 24 (2013), 575–582.<br>
