Perception as Objectification 57</div>

perceptual psychology is that it individuates psychological states in ways partly typed in <br>
terms of specifications of distal environmental attributes. Individuation of the states is <br>
non-local. Such individuation of states as representing non-local, environmental entities <br>
has enabled empirical explanations that answer a natural question—how does one see? or <br>
how does one visually represent in an accurate way?<br>
<br>
The states are individuated not purely in terms of environmental (or in the case of pro-<br>
prioception internal-bodily) entities that they represent. They are also individuated in <br>
terms of causal and functional roles with respect to other psychological states—including <br>
non-perceptual registrational states, other perceptual states, and conative states. (See note <br>
46; and Chapter 8, the section Is Temporal Representation Constitutive to <br>
Perceptual Representation?.) These facts underlie individuating, or typing, the <br>
states in terms of their veridicality conditions (together with their mode, like <i>visual per­<br>
ceptual state</i>), where the veridicality conditions are taken to have a specific mode of pres-<br>
entation—a way in which the psychology functions to present a <i>representatum</i> to the mind <br>
via a type of causal relation to proximal stimulation—that is an exercise of a very specific <br>
psychological capacity. The key point is that perceptual state kinds are individuated in <br>
causal explanations partly in terms of what they specify. They specify, through their ver-<br>
idi cal ity conditions, aspects of the wider environment or, in the case of proprioceptive <br>
perception, aspects of the perceiver’s body. Causal explanations of formations of <i>non</i>-per-<br>
ceptual sensory-registration state-kinds individuate the kinds in terms of aspects of the <br>
initial registration of the proximal stimulus. I explore these points in greater detail in <br>
Chapter 3.<br>
<br>
Perceptual constancies do not depend on propositional or conceptual competencies. <br>
They are present in species, such as some species of arthropods, that surely lack such <br>
capacities.<br>
<br>
Perceptual constancies show up in various perceptual modalities. A wide variety of per-<br>
ceptual constancies occur in any reasonably complex visual perceptual system: shape, size, <br>
ordinal depth, object position, motion, color, lightness, object constancies are all com-<br>
mon. Hearing in many animals exhibits object-position constancies. Proprioception can <br>
exhibit such constancies, sometimes via an internal body map. Touch shows texture con-<br>
stancy, motion constancy, and location constancy.49<br>
<br>
Taste can exhibit an analog of location constancy, on the tongue, for example. The <br>
localization of pain, like the localization associated with taste, is usually traceable to per-<br>
ceptual constancies in touch or proprioception, not taste or pain sensing.<br><br>
