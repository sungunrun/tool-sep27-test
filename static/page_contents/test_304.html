304 The Iconic Nature of Perception</div>

respect to the tanks, the spatial attributive structure into which they are fitted is certainly <br>
iconic. Referential applications are applied within a structure that is iconically related to <br>
the array of particulars that the referential applications function to pick out. For percep-<br>
tual representation, iconicity is centrally a feature of the attributives—property, kind, and <br>
relational attributives.<br>
<br>
Since being iconic is not in itself being representational, perceptual representation’s <br>
being iconic depends on there being non-representational aspects of perceptual attribution. <br>
What are the non-representational features that make perception’s iconic representation <br>
possible? The primary features are geometrical or topographical, temporal, and qualitative.<br><br>

<b>Iconic Aspects of Perceptual Spatial Representation<br><br>
</div>
</b>Spatial structure is by far the most thoroughly studied non-representational natural fea-<br>
ture used in iconic perceptual representation. Many philosophers have ridiculed the idea <br>
of a picture in the mind. They base the ridicule partly on the correct point that perceptual <br>
state kinds do not literally have spatial extension. Modern perceptual theory does not <br>
attribute the literal spatiality of pictures to perception. Representational contents are <br>
abstract psychological kinds. They are not laid out in space. Yet perceptual theory does <br>
take visual and tactile perception to be spatially iconic.305 Aspects of matrix-like or <br>
picture-like format of perceptual content are attributed in models of perceptual represen-<br>
tation. Such aspects can be mapped geometrically to spatial structures in the environment. <br>
The mapping preserves, in the format of perceptual representational content, analogs of <br>
en vir on men tal spatial structure. The pure geometry that applies to perceptual representa-<br>
tional content derives from the geometry of physical space. Geometrical and topological <br>
structures are natural, non-representational aspects of perceptual representation. The <br>
structure of normal perceptual representational content is topological, even if not specifically <br>
spatial. The structure of both the spatial subject matter and the perceptual representational <br>
content can be described in pure geometry or topology. Thus an edge element in a perceptual <br>
content represents and can be mapped to an edge in the environment. Parts of the edge <br>
element represent parts of the edge in the environment. Directional—say, left–right— <br>
relations in the percept correspond to directional relations in the scene.<br>
<br>
Such mapping occurs in conscious experience. One can block light from the lower half <br>
of one’s eye. One thereby blocks representation of the lower part of the scene. Similarly, for <br>
the upper, the left, the right, and smaller parts of one’s eye. There is a systematic cor res-<br>
pond ence between spatial aspects of one’s receptive apparatus, spatial aspects of the per-<br>
ceived environment, and spatial aspects of one’s perceptual representation of the <br>
environment. No similar mappings occur between words in a non-iconic sentence and <br>
spatial subject matters of the words.306<br><br>
