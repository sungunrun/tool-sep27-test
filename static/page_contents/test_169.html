or semantical value, or has, under an assignment, failed to be connected to a referent or <br>
semantical value. Such “assignments” are, of course, not meta-representational. They <br>
occur via events of referential application of a standing perceptual competence. The appli-<br>
cations represent by following back causation, via perceptual competencies, from a pur-<br>
portedly perceived discriminated particular. The referentially applied determiner that x1 <br>
functions to refer to a particular body. That x2 functions to refer to an instance of <i>brown</i>. <br>
That x3 functions to apply to a particular instance of <i>cubical.</i> The two instances and their <br>
types function to characterize the body picked out by that x1.<br>
<br>
The perceptual state’s representational content is accurate if and only if the referential <br>
applications perceptually single out instances of <i>body</i>, <i>brown</i>, and <i>cubical</i>; and the instance <br>
of <i>body</i>—the body—is in fact brown and cubical by having those instances of <i>brown</i> <br>
and <i>cubical</i>.<br>
<br>
This expanded exposition of perceptual representational content and structure is, of <br>
course, an abstraction from a more complex content. The more complex content contains <br>
perceptual attributives and referential applications for surfaces, parts of surfaces, edges of <br>
surfaces, shapes of surfaces, colors, textures, movement, backgrounds, and so on. It con-<br>
tains attributions of depth relations, locations, timings, and so on. These attributives are <br>
arranged in an iconic, matrix-like structure. Many of the attributives have counterparts at <br>
different levels of abstraction. I go into these matters further in what follows in this chap-<br>
ter and in Chapters 7–9. To specify an actual perceptual state in a manageable way, one <br>
must abstract out some aspects of the state. A normal, full perceptual state would com-<br>
monly require a colossal number of words to specify.<br><br>

</b>Even the slightly more complex representational structure and content cited above elicits <br>
new semantical relations in perceptual representational content.<br>
<br>
First, some structural and semantical points regarding perceptual <i>referential applica-<br>
tions</i>. Every attributive in the exemplified representational content accompanies a referen-<br>
tial application. Each functions to be accurate of the referent of its referential application. <br>
Each attributive effects an attributional application. In other words, each of the perceptual <br>
attributives functions to apply to a perceived particular attribute-instance. In two cases, <br>
the attribute-instance is a trope. Insofar as an attributive accompanies a referential appli-<br>
cation that functions to pick out an instance of the attributive’s indicant (an instance of the <br>
indicated attribute-type), it functions to guide reference.<br>
<br>
Referential applications can fail. Failures are referential illusions. In such cases, the ref-<br>
erential applications—the events or aspects of occurrent perceptual states that function to <br>
refer—do occur. They fail to connect to a referent. One’s sensory receptors could be stimu-<br>
lated artificially, or in some natural but unusual way, to cause referential illusion. In a full <br>
perceptual representational content, there may be some referential failures and some ref-<br>
erential successes. In a case of referential failure by all referential applications, nothing is <br>
perceived at all. Of course, one could perceive a color, but have a referential illusion as of a <br>
body (or any other coherent object), because the perception is not caused by anything <br>
with a connected outer boundary. I think that one could perceive a body, but have a refer-<br>
ential illusion of a specific color.</div>
