non-relational and relational spatial attributives. Such cues vary with each surface and <br>
with how the surface is encountered. But then, by the argument already given, each com-<br>
bin ation of cues will generate formation of a different relational attributive—an exercise of <br>
a psychologically distinct way of representing the specific orientation relation. Each <br>
at tribu tive is a different ability-general perceptual competence. Different cues will gener-<br>
ate states that attribute a specific orientation relation, but that differ in psychological prop-<br>
erties such as speed of formation and reliability in being accurate. Even the way in which a <br>
given orientation <i>looks</i> commonly varies with the cues that make possible the computa-<br>
tion of a representation of that orientation. The look derives from the non-relational prop-<br>
erties of particulars that generate stimuli that, in turn, cue the computation of the <br>
perceptual state that attributes the orientation.<br>
<br>
As emphasized in Chapter 6, the section Perceptual Attribution of <br>
Relations, relations are perceptually attributed only by also perceptually attributing <br>
non-relational attributes (color shades, textural patterns, surface shapes, and so on) to pur-<br>
portedly perceived particulars. Perceptual attribution of relations is inter-dependent with <br>
constancies for non-relational properties whose instances are located in the framework. <br>
Perceptual attributives for relations could not be computed independently and in a perspec-<br>
tive independent way. (See Chapter 3, the sections Two Misguided Ways of Thinking <br>
About Perceptual Constancies and Visual Temporal Perceptual <br>
Constancies.) As we have seen, attributives for given, non-relational properties vary <br>
with their formation cues and modes of presentation. Perceptual attribution of relations <br>
<i>depends on</i> cues for forming perceptual attribution of non-relational properties. So, in any <br>
given perceptual system, any given spatial relation—whether it be a perspectival spatial <br>
relation or a non-perspectival spatial relation—can be perceptually represented in numer-<br>
ous ways. Many–one relations hold not only between non-relational perceptual attribu-<br>
tives and their indicants, but also between relational perceptual at tribu tives and <i>their</i> <br>
indicants. In fact, many–one relations hold between relational attributives and their indi-<br>
cants <i>partly because</i> they hold between non-relational attributives and <i>their</i> indicants. <br>
Modes of presentation for relations partly depend on modes of presentation for non-<br>
relational properties. So the fact that there are many—one relations between one-place <br>
perceptual attributives and the non-relational properties that they attribute insures that <br>
there are many–one relations between relational perceptual attributives and the relations <br>
that <i>they</i> attribute. The latter many–one relations are partly derivative from the former.<br>
<br>
Each visual perceptual way of representing any given non-relational property or any <br>
given relation differs from other ways by deriving from different cues derived from differ-<br>
ent proximal stimuli. Different ways of perceptually representing a given <i>representatum</i> <br>
can also derive from different perceptual memories or perceptual anticipations, different <br>
priming or adaptation histories, or different <i>foci</i> of attention. All of these sources of differ-<br>
ence depend on the perceiver’s specific, perspectival relation to perceptual <i>representata</i>. So <br>
all yield perspectival differences among perceptual representations for given <i>representata</i>. <br>
So all perceptual representation is perspectival—perceptual representation of non-<br>
perspectival properties, like length, size, shape, and non-perspectival relations, like dis-<br>
tance of <i>x</i> from <i>y</i>, as well as perceptual representation of perspectival relations, like <br>
distance of <i>x</i> from ego-here, or orientation of <i>x</i> from ego-here. The perspectival nature of <br>
perceptual representation resides not in its <i>representata</i>—some of which are viewer <br>
dependent, some of which are not. That nature resides in the fact that the identities of </div>
