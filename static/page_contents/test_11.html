representation—representation of size, shape, position, motion, speed, color, surface, <br>
body, body-parts, and so on. I consider whether attention is necessary for the formation of <br>
perceptual states. I discuss types of representation that may extend this list of core types of <br>
visual attributives. Possible extensions include attributives for various types of function <br>
and attributives for causation and agency.<br>
<br>
The book’s third aim is to understand some relations between visual perception and <br>
closely related psychological capacities—perceptually guided action, perceptual attention, <br>
perceptual memory, perceptual affect, perceptual learning, perceptual anticipation, and <br>
perceptual imagining. I devote special attention to the <i>perceptual level</i> within each of the <br>
generic capacities—conation, attention, memory, affect, learning, anticipating, imagining. <br>
I caution against thinking of the generic capacities as monolithic. I discuss wherein sub-<br>
species are at the same representational level as, and part of the same computational <br>
 system as, perceptual representation.<br>
<br>
As rough approximation, higher-level, supra-perceptual-level, processes involve types <br>
of representation or transformation that are more sophisticated and more knowledge-like <br>
than those in perceptual-level representation. Higher-level processes use representations <br>
that have forms and functions that perceptual-level representations lack. In most cases <br>
higher-level capacities evolved later than perceptual-level capacities. Roughly, <i>perceptual-<br>
level</i> capacities include perception and other capacities typed by the representational con-<br>
tent of perceptual states. Such capacities do not enter into operations that are more <br>
sophisticated or more knowledge-like than perception. Fuller explication of the notion of <br>
a perceptual-level capacity occurs at the beginning of Part IV. Chapters 13–19 focus on <br>
such capacities.<br>
<br>
A fourth aim is not centered in one part of the book. It runs through almost the whole. It <br>
is systematic opposition to an old empiricist way of thinking about perception, and its rela-<br>
tion to thought, inherited from classical empiricists—mainly Locke and Hume. This view <br>
correctly takes perceptions to have an image-like character. However, it conceives the con-<br>
tents of images in terms of what seems salient in perceptual experience. Such a view tends <br>
to ignore, doubt, or underestimate the prevalence of unconscious perception and percep-<br>
tual operations that are not part of conscious experience. More importantly, it neglects the <br>
capacities, functions, and uses that give perception the form and content that it has. (I see <br>
Kant as an early opponent of such neglect.) For example, it takes perception to group <br>
aspects of images by what, to the empiricist, seems to be intuitive types of similarity or <br>
intuitive relations that image-parts bear to one another. Such groupings are taken to be <br>
concrete, in accord with the idea that a perception is an image that is to be understood by <br>
introspection of intuitively salient aspects of experience. All thought is taken to contrast <br>
with perception by being more abstract and perhaps initially derived by a process of <br>
abstraction from perception. So thought cannot be as concrete or imagistically specific as <br>
perception. And perception cannot be abstract, because it is imagistically and intuitively <br>
concrete. All these points are supposed to be derived from reflection on phenomenally salient <br>
features of perceptual images. The empiricist distinction between perception and thought <br>
lies along an intuitive, but not-very-well-articulated, spectrum of concrete-to-abstract. Few <br>
explicitly develop and elaborate the model nowadays. It retains a surprising unreflective <br>
resilience in philosophy and parts of psychology outside mainstream psychophysics.<br>
<br>
The view elaborated in this book follows not introspection or intuitive senses of <br>
image-similarity. It focuses on capacities to form and use perception that are discovered in </div>
