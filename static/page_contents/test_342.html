of that aspect of the perceptual state that applies these attributive representations. “Picking <br>
out” the part, perceptually representing it in a singular way, consists in applying these <br>
competencies.<br>
<br>
In favorable viewing circumstances, natural-unit wholes are plotted, in the sense dis-<br>
cussed in Chapter 7, the section Minimalism and Iconic Representation in a <br>
Spatial Coordinate System. They are plotted in such a way as to give each visible <br>
part a different location relative others. The parts might be located exactly in space relative <br>
to a viewer. Or they might be represented as being in a certain direction with an ordinal <br>
depth from perceiver position. Insufficiently precise localization in space might lead to <br>
indeterminacy in which parts are perceptually discernible, since basic properties like <br>
 orientation, size, and contour cannot be accurately perceived. Of course, the spatial attribu-<br>
tion can be mistaken, while a sub-part of a unit is still perceived. Then specific causal chains <br>
from the perceived particular channel perception to the distinct unsegmented sub-parts.<br>
<br>
The iconic nature of perception makes less imposing the huge number of attributional <br>
applications. The attributives that situate a sub-part of a natural unit in space are aspects of <br>
a general spatial mapping of what is perceived. So the different spatial relational attribu-<br>
tives are simply parts in a larger spatial framework of representation. Attributives for spa-<br>
tial properties like length, size, shape are products of the same mapping. They derive from <br>
situating a perceived unit in the mapping framework. The part-of attributive is generated <br>
simply as a product of perceiving a sub-part as within a natural-unit boundary. So a single <br>
boundary representation generates part of attributives for anything of the same unit (for <br>
example, <i>surface</i>) that is perceived within the boundary. Many sub-parts are perceived as <br>
having properties that they have only <i>because</i> that are perceived as within a larger unit. <br>
Attribution of the attributive edge, surface, or body to a sub-part that is not independently <br>
delimited is derivative in a similar way.<br>
<br>
Generalized doubt about the huge number of referential applications and attributional <br>
applications involved in perception of spatially extended entities tends to derive from <br>
focus on language. It would indeed be a linguistic mouthful to swallow if the semantics <br>
were linguistic. It is not. The linguistic renderings of attributives associated with the iconic <br>
representation are just specifications of the semantical functions of iconic contents. The <br>
contents are themselves competencies, or exercises of competencies. The semantic com-<br>
plexity is simply a reflection of the complexity of the representational competencies.<br>
<br>
There are two, more specific sources of doubt that I caution against.<br>
<br>
One centers on the fact that often in perceiving sub-parts of a natural unit, one does not <br>
perceptually rely on natural units. One could insist that although a perceiver could be <br>
brought to attend to endpoints of the sub-parts if the endpoints were somehow high-<br>
lighted, application of attributives remains merely potential, in the absence of such <br>
attention.<br>
<br>
There is indeed a distinction between natural perceptual units and parts of those units <br>
that are seen only by being seen as parts of natural units. Each of the by-courtesy units <br>
<i>could</i> be seen as an explicitly bounded unit if its boundaries were made perceptually sali-<br>
ent. A visual state does change when the endpoints of a non-naturally segmented, seen <br>
part are highlighted. One change is that the part is easily noticed and distinguished from <br>
other parts through attention. Attention makes it more likely that the part is remembered.<br>
<br>
However, seeing something does not require attending to it. The length, position (or <br>
ordinal depth), and curvature of an edge, and each of its discernible sub-parts, are </div>
