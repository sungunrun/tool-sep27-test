circuitry includes the superior colliculus as well as FEF. Influence of FEF-based attention <br>
on V4 and IT was found to occur only following microsaccades toward the attended <br>
stimu lus. Onset of neural attentional modulations was found to be tightly coupled to onset <br>
of a microsaccade.784 Saccades are not only initiated. They are inhibited under certain <br>
conditions.785<br>
<br>
I return from saccades and saccade initiations to attention and attention initiation, sup-<br>
ported in FEF. Following usage by specialists in this area, I have called relevant attention, <br>
and attention initiations, supported in FEF, ‘endogenous’. In what sense are they en dogen-<br>
ous? I characterized endogenous attention as attention dominantly initiated by antecedent <br>
internal factors. (See this chapter, the section Forms of Perceptual Attention.) <br>
Sometimes endogenous attention is differently characterized—as voluntary attention. (See <br>
note 730.) Although scientists who use this characterization do not regard voluntariness as <br>
involving higher-level (say, propositional) willings, and although some of them take volun-<br>
tariness to <i>amount</i> to “coming from within”, some may assume that voluntary attention <br>
derives from some individual control, including unconscious individual control. I have not <br>
seen the term ‘voluntary’ given a serious explication by any scientist. Perhaps some repre-<br>
sentational initiations of endogenous attention do derive from factors that are under indi-<br>
vidual control. But the standard usage is to conceive endogenous attention as attention <br>
initiated dominantly from within, and as governed by principles that do not center on the <br>
current stimulus, but derive from factors that are usually modulated by individual needs <br>
and targets.786 Endogenous attention, whether as a feedback or a feed-forward type, must <br>
show the standard signatures of attention—such as selection and competitor-suppression.<br>
<br>
Many scientists take default initiations of attention based on a priority map for saccades <br>
to be endogenous. Such initiations are not plausibly controlled by the individual, even in <br>
the broadest sense of that phrase, except inasmuch as individuals can co-opt attention and <br>
interrupt default initiations. Exogenous attention derives from receptor settings biased to <br>
types of stimuli, such as abrupt motion or pop-out. By contrast, default initiations of <br>
attention hinge less on the nature of the stimulus and more on antecedent task orienta-<br>
tions. So settings for default initiations commonly vary across individuals and times—<br>
because individuals’ tasks vary. Since these task-orientation factors are antecedent internal <br>
factors, they are endogenous on the traditional conception. Moreover, I assume that <br><br>
