586 Perceptual Memory: Short-Term Systems</div>
<br><br>
Working memory is called ‘active’, because of the postulated inclusion in it of the ex ecu-<br>
tive control system—clearly a source of activity. On this view, visual working memory is <br>
counted active also because it includes manipulations of content. Some count working <br>
memory a ‘cognitive’ system because of the coordinating and managerial roles of the <br>
ex ecu tive control system, and because they assume that that system is without qualifica-<br>
tion, cognitive.865<br>
<br>
Some operation levels of the executive control system are cognitive, as are some in <br>
working memory. Controlling attention in adding numbers is one of the executive control <br>
system’s operations on working memory.<br>
<br>
It is open to theorists to postulate systems that include components with a number of <br>
different functions. Here, working memory is counted a system that includes operations, <br>
including active cognitive operations, on the retentions from perception provided by <br>
working memory.<br>
<br>
The idea behind postulating a single system here is that the components work together <br>
in a way that forms a natural psychological kind, with its own law-like operations. Within <br>
the system, perceptual contents that enter into working memory are subjects of conceptual <br>
operations; and conceptual content is also retained in working memory.<br>
<br>
Baddeley’s work illuminated connections between working memory as a retention sys-<br>
tem and active operations on it by other systems, such as the executive control system. <br>
Baddeley-inspired work has made much of the fruitfulness of studying the retention and <br>
maintenance system together with the manipulations that it allows. The approach has <br>
motivated calling the whole complex—the retention system, the executive control system, <br>
and the various operations of the executive control system on the retention system—<br>
‘working memory’. In a broad sense, the complex can, I think be regarded as a system that <br>
has various representational levels within it.<br>
<br>
A slightly narrower usage limits the term ‘working memory’ to holding information in <br>
mind and working with it.866 On this usage, working memory still includes both retention <br>
and operations on the retention. For example, working memory would not only retain a <br>
perceived list of words, but manipulations of the list, reversing its order. This usage <br>
excludes operations of the executive system that block distractors or shift tasks. Like the <br><br>

qualification—if one uses ‘cognitive’ to apply to a supra-perceptual level of representation. Some aspects of the <br>

<b>FN</b>866 Diamond, ‘Executive Functions’, 147. Diamond argues that ‘working memory’ should apply to a system <br>
that involves both retention and active manipulation (such as reversing lists or rotating images) on the retained <br>
content. Diamond supports this liberal use of ‘working memory’ by pointing out that retention can be dissoci-<br>
ated from operations on retained material, as in deliberately producing a sequence of retained items in reverse <br>
order. E. Awh, J. Jonides, E. Smith, E. Schumacher, R. Koeppe, and S. Katz, ‘Dissociation of Storage and Rehearsal <br>

retained material. Thus memory-retention is a distinct system. It is working memory in that it invites and allows <br>
“work”. There is certainly a functional deficiency if working memory is separated from operations on it that it <br>
functions to allow.</div>
