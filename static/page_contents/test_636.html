636 Perceptual Learning, Anticipation, Imagining</div>
<br><br>
Obviously, anticipatory representation occurs not only in simple motion tracking. It <br>
occurs in tracking through occlusion. For longer than the briefest occlusions (longer than <br>
200 ms), it is not possible to integrate consecutive visual samples into a spatio-temporally <br>
continuous percept. Mammalian perception, and probably perception by birds and other <br>
non-mammals, provides constancy of attributes such as <i>body</i>, <i>body-shape</i>, and motion <br>
trajectory. Motion and particulars can be tracked through occlusion. Anticipation of pos-<br>
ition of a moving object after an occlusion, by maintaining constancies for trajectory, <br>
velocity, and acceleration, is widespread and well known. Details of storage and conditions <br>
of anticipatory tracking when a moving object disappears have been studied in some depth.<br>
<br>
For example, it takes a longer exposure to a pattern of motion to anticipate acceleration <br>
accurately than it does to anticipate velocity.1010 As with anticipatory smooth pursuit of a <br>
fully visible object, such pursuit of an occluded object is not purely a reflex or driven <br>
purely by visual input and visual memory. Systems can adjust to task-related targets.1011<br>
<br>
Anticipatory representation also occurs among lower mammals preparing for action. <br>
Viewing delivery of food to an as yet unvisited position produces pre-activation of repre-<br>
sentations that anticipate navigation toward that position. Evidence comes from activation <br>
of hippocampal neurons that can be mapped to the position associated with future <br>
reward.1012<br>
<br>
I have emphasized the primitiveness of mechanisms in anticipatory representation that <br>
tracks motion. They include efferent copy and condition mechanisms. Here these old <br>
mechanisms embed representational states. Any system capable of perceptually represent-<br>
ing motion can be expected to have incorporated one or both of these mechanisms. The <br>
second, the more primitive one, is, of course, applicable in perceptually representing <br>
almost any repetitive pattern. Some anticipatory and short-term-memory capacity can be <br>
expected throughout animal perception.<br>
<br>
It would be obviously mistaken to count these mechanisms <i>cognitive</i> in a sense that <br>
entails supra-perceptual. They are nearly inevitable companions of perception. The mem-<br>
ory mechanisms and conditional mechanisms that figure in simple forms of anticipatory <br>
representation are less complex, less a result of impressive evolution, than formation pro-<br>
cesses in perception itself. A divide between the perceptual and the cognitive should be a <br>
significant joint among psychological capacities. No such joint divides perception from <br>
perceptual memory or perceptual anticipation.<br>
<br>
Perceptual memory and anticipatory perceptual-level representation do contrast with <br>
perception in being more removed from representation of here and now. Representation’s <br>
reach beyond functioning to respond to present stimulation is certainly a difference <br>
between memory and anticipation, on one hand, and perception, on the other.<br><br>
