body. Unlike the corresponding perceptual attributive, the main attributive in (A) is not <br>
dominated by any referential application. It dominates all referential applications.198<br>
<br>
The main-verb component (cubicalc) scope-dominates that referential application as <br>
well as the referential application by that x1 to the body. Its characterization role dom in-<br>
ates. I think that all propositional structures contain cross-attribute attribution.<br>
<br>
The propositional content (A) differs from the propositional content<br><br>
(B) cubical(c)[(that x1)(body(i)(x1))].<br><br>
In (B) the attributive cubical is not connected to any <i>de re</i> representation of an instance of <br>
<i>cubical</i>. (B) but not (A) could be true if one bases the belief (B) on seeing a body in the <br>
distance, not seeing its cubical shape but basing the attribution of <i>cubical</i> on background <br>
knowledge. Then one believes (B) (with <i>de re</i> application functioning to apply only to a <br>
body), and not (A). To be true, (A) requires a <i>de re</i> relation both to a body and to an <br>
instance of the shape, <i>cubical</i>.<br>
<br>
Both propositional contents differ from the perceptual content:<br><br>
(C) (that x1)[(that x2)(cubical(c)(x1), cubical(i)(x2), body(i)(x1))],<br><br>
which like (A) is doubly <i>de re</i>. (C) is, of course, non-propositional.<br>
<br>
The point is that although primitive propositional structures can involve <i>de re</i> applica-<br>
tions even in use of the widest-scope, main-verb-phrase-like attributive, the attributive <br>
function of the main attributive outranks any function that serves reference. That is what <br>
makes it a main-verb-phrase-like attributive. Its primary function is attributional, not <br>
guiding or otherwise accompanying a referential application.199<br><br>

<b>FOOTNOTES</b><br>
<b>Cont FN</b>198 In (A), the two occurrences of the conceptual attributive cubical mark its different roles in cross-attribute <br>
and intra-attribute attribution.<br>
199 In Burge, <i>Origins of Objectivity</i>, 541–544 and in T. Burge, ‘Steps Toward Origins of Propositional Thought’, <br>
<i>Disputatio</i> 4 (2010), 39–67, 41–45, I propose that freedom from guiding or accompanying a referential applica-<br>
tion is the key to understanding the way in which propositional form differs from the noun-phrase-like form of <br>
perception.<br>
Incidentally, the latter work improves in other respects on the former. See Burge, ‘Steps Toward Origins of <br>
Propositional Thought’, 43–46nn5–6.) In the latter work, I wrote, ‘In all propositional representational content, <br>
some occurrence of an attributive, a <i>purely predicative occurrence</i> is freed from functioning to be applied in <br>
context-dependent identificational reference’ (44–45). A <i>purely predicative occurrence</i> of an attributive is one ‘in <br>
which the attributive functions predicatively but does not function to make an attribution within the scope of a <br>
context-bound, identificational referential structure. . .’ (43).<br>
This view still seems to me correct. (A) and (B) illustrate it. When I made the proposal, I had not thought <br>
clearly about <i>de re</i> representation by the same attributive that occurs in main-verb-phrase position, as illustrated <br>
in (A). Given that different types of <i>attribution</i> occur with this attributive (here, cubical), it is possible to accom-<br>
modate the example. The same attributive type is used to guide and betoken a <i>de re</i> application and to operate (in <br>
a logically distinct role) purely predicatively. The key to understanding this structure lies in understanding the <br>
competencies exercised in the different occurrences. Of course, the occurrences need not be thought of as mark-<br>
ing different events. They mark different structural and representational roles.<br>
In the earlier work, I wrote in way that strongly suggests a mistake about perceptual attributives. I wrote, ‘. . . all <br>
perceptual attributives function to be applied by context-bound identificational referential structures. . .’: Burge, <br>
‘Steps Toward Origins of Propositional Thought’, 43. <i>Relational</i> perceptual attributives are not <i>directly</i> applied by <br>
context-bound referential applications, but no such qualification is explicit in that passage. Most, probably all, <br>
relational perceptual attributives do not function to betoken instances of the relational attribute that they indi-<br>
cate. They function only to attribute relation-types between or among particulars that are picked out by referen-<br>
tial applications that directly apply <i>other</i>, non-relational, attributives to perceived particulars. (See this chapter, <br>
the section Perceptual Attribution of Relations.) (<i>cont.</i>)</div>
