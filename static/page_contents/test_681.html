She cites no evidence for this claim. It is certainly untrue as regards psychology, and <br>
doubtful as applied to philosophy. Fodor spoke of encapsulation of psychological <i>systems</i>. <br>
Pylyshyn centers on penetrability of early vision. Psychological systems and early vision <br>
are functional notions, not notions that hinge on whether their products are conscious. <br>
Many discussions follow Fodor and Pylyshyn in this focus. However, MacPherson is not <br>
alone in focusing on visual experience.1112<br>
<br>
I believe that focus on experience can be harmless, as long as it is contrasted with the <br>
Fodor–Pylyshyn focus, and from my own. A focus on experience does have a baleful ten-<br>
dency in philosophy to be associated with not thinking empirically about psychological <br>
natural kinds. Much such discussion is off-hand. There is no advanced science of percep-<br>
tual experience <i>per se</i>, or indeed of consciousness. Perceptual experience, colloquially <br>
understood, is a hybrid of perceptual and cognitive (conceptual) elements. As I indicated, <br>
MacPherson’s own defense of her claim of cognitive penetration of visual experience elides <br>
crucial differences between perceptual and conceptual attributives, and between beliefs <br>
and lower-level associations.1113<br>
<br>
Pylyshyn writes, ‘Our subjective experience of the world fails to distinguish among the <br>
various sources of this experience, whether they arise from the visual system or from our <br>
beliefs’.1114 I say, indeed.<br>
<br>
Psychological science routinely uses voluntary reports from subjects in experiments as <br>
evidence for hypotheses about psychological structure. Such reports derive from the sub-<br>
jects’ conscious states. The reports’ relation to explanatory models is complex. There are <br>
many other sources of evidence—neural, non-verbal behavioral, force-choice tests, for <br>
example. The consciousness involved in accessing experience is different from the phe-<br>
nomenal consciousness that one accesses. Access often involves judgments. Some aspects <br>
of experience do not.1115 It is reasonable to be interested in putative cognitive effects on <br>
phenomenal perceptual consciousness. Insofar as one is interested in psychological kinds, <br><br>

<b>FN</b>1113 MacPherson observes that Pylyshyn denies that the output of the early visual system should be thought of <br>
as being or determining one’s visual experience: MacPherson, ‘Cognitive Penetration of Colour Experience: <br>
Rethinking the Issue in Light of an Indirect Mechanism’, 26–27. She infers <i>directly</i> that Pylyshyn’s thesis is ‘about <br>
the subpersonal representational outputs of brain processing mechanisms’. This inference is certainly mistaken. <br>
In fact, MacPherson cites some things (27n1) that Pylyshyn says that are incompatible with it. Pylyshyn thinks <br>
that the output of the visual system is not identical with visual experience for at least two reasons. First, for him <br>
early vision does not include categorizations, and visual experience, as normally understood, does. This view is <br>
compatible with holding that in being conscious, such categorizations necessarily involve aspects (such as per-<br>
ceptual shape representations) that are also conscious. Second, Pylyshyn thinks, correctly, that intuitions about <br>
phenomenal experience are not good guides to psychological kinds—his main interest. Nothing that Pylyshyn <br>
writes suggests that he thinks that all products of the early visual system are unconscious or sub-personal. It is <br>
open to him to think that conscious perceptual attributions of shape and color are products of what he counts as <br>
the early visual system. MacPherson’s main points are not much affected by these mistakes, or indeed by her <br>
focus on perceptual experience.<br>
