becomes perceptual attribution of intervals through timing perceived events.184 As with <br>
attribution of spatial relations, such intervals can either relate two or more perceived par-<br>
ticulars, or relate one or more perceived particulars to an indexically established but not <br>
perceived time.<br>
<br>
For example, a stage of movement of a body could be perceived as occurring at a spe-<br>
cific interval after an initial, indexically established present<i>.</i> By contrast, when one per-<br>
ceives initiation of movement of one body as before (either ordinally or at a certain <br>
interval) its collision with another, the temporal relation is attributed to two per-<br>
ceived events.<br>
<br>
An animal could attribute an interval between an indexically established present and a <br>
time perceptually <i>anticipated</i>, where nothing is yet perceived at that time. For example, a <br>
cat’s body clock could establish an interval between a certain time, the time of last sa ti-<br>
ation from eating and an anticipated perception of a feeding at a future time. Then one of <br>
the <i>relata</i> (the feeding) is perceived when the perceptual state first occurs. The anchor <br>
time is not perceived. A perceptual referential application to an anticipated second feeding <br>
may occur. Its function is to refer to a future perceived event that is not yet perceived. <br>
Alternatively, the second feeding is not yet referred to in perceptual anticipation. It is sche-<br>
matically anticipated. The cat might not perceive an initial feeding. Its timer may begin <br>
through some non-perceptual sensory registration. It may still perceptually anticipate a <br>
(perceived) later feeding at a specific time. These are all different cases. I discuss them fur-<br>
ther in Chapter 18, the section Perceptual Anticipation.<br>
<br>
The point is that although many perceptual attributions of relation-types, in which the <br>
relation-instances of the types are not perceived, involve perception of the <i>relata</i>, there are <br>
also perceptual attributions of relation-types in which one of the <i>relata</i> is not perceived, <br>
but rather perceptually anchored by a referentially applied schematic indexical constitu-<br>
ent. And there are cases of <i>perceptual-level</i> attributions of relation-types—for example, in <br>
perceptual anticipation—in which neither relation-instances nor their <i>relata</i> are perceived. <br>
In perceptual anticipation, such attributions become accurate if and only if relevant antici-<br>
pated <i>relata</i> are later perceived.<br>
<br>
Perceivers may perhaps perceive the instances of <i>some</i> relations that they per cep-<br>
tual ly attribute. We perceive motions, collisions, and so on. For example, a collision may <br>
be an event that is perceived and that involves spatial and contact relations between <br>
two col liders. One could doubt that one perceives the instances of the relevant rela-<br>
tions, as opposed to just the event and the colliders. Motions are events that are indi-<br>
viduated as changes that occupy one position at one time and another position at a <br>
later time. Insofar as motions and collisions <i>are</i> relations as opposed to types of events, <br>
instances of motions and collisions could, I suppose, be perceived. However, I doubt <br>
this account of motions and collisions. I think that motions and other events are par-<br>
ticulars. I do not argue the issue. In Chapter 8, the section Egocentric Temporal <br>
Frameworks and Perceptual Representation of Motion, I do develop the <br>
view further.<br>
