It is often said that perception represents at a level of detail that is incompatible with <br>
conceptual representation. This type of remark is very much mistaken. In the first place, <br>
iconic representation, including perception, can be quite sketchy and not at all rich. (See <br>
Chapters 10 and 11.) In the second, as just noted, conceptual representation, both concep-<br>
tualizations of perceptual attributives and non-iconic, linguistic, conceptual representa-<br>
tion, have no intrinsic limit on the amount of detail that it can incorporate. As just noted, <br>
iconic conceptual representation can incorporate pictorial or perceptual representation <br>
into conceptual/propositional structure. A concept can take a percept as a constitutive <br>
aspect of its mode of presentation—conceptualizing it.<br>
<br>
Being a conceptual content, or concept, requires having an ability-general representa-<br>
tional function in <i>propositional</i> structure.361 Such a structure marks capacities for propos-<br>
ition al inference. It also helps type-individuate representational functions that involve <br>
attribution and that are not dominated by referential applications—main-verb-phrase-like <br>
attributions.<br>
<br>
The iconic character of perceptual representation differentiates it markedly from repre-<br>
sentation by most noun phrases in modern languages. Although noun phrases can be <br>
pictorial, most representation in most of the most widely used modern languages is not <br>
iconic. Clearly, though, Chinese and other languages retain strong and obvious vestiges of <br>
iconic elements in their forms of representation. In many modern languages, however, <br>
most symbols are not iconic. Most words bear no natural, non-representational relation to <br>
their <i>representata</i>.<br>
<br>
So being iconic differentiates the representational content of perception from that of <br>
many modern noun phrases governed by context-dependent determiners. Both types of <br>
representation involve context-dependent determiners, guided by attributives, that with <br>
occurrent use become <i>de re</i>. Both are non-propositional. Most noun-phrases in language <br>
are not iconic and do not represent through being iconic.362<br>
<br>
One could, however, use drawings as noun phrases or predicates in a proposition. <br>
Suppose that one has two drawings. The first is a black and white drawing of two objects. <br>
The drawing is used in a singular way with applications to the two objects. Suppose that <br>
the second drawing is of a red dot and a green dot, arranged in positions that correspond <br>
to the first and second object in the first drawing. The second drawing is held up after the <br>
first, and used to attribute the colors indicated to the respective objects. The result could <br>
be an iconic propositional representation. All the attributives in the proposition would be <br>
iconic. Only the referential applications and the attribution would, in themselves, be non-<br>
iconic. The drawings get their representational content and structural roles from their use.<br>
<br>
In fact, the most generic semantical structure of <i>any</i> representational state in a psych-<br>
ology is never in itself iconic. In most cases, that structure is either nominal or propos-<br>
ition al. The nature of some ability-general constituents, centrally attributives, can include <br>
being iconic. Use of iconic elements in attributives can make the attributives (hence <br><br>

<b>Cont FN</b>361 See Kant, <i>Critique of Pure Reason</i>, B93–94. For Kant, a concept is a predicate of a possible judgment. <br>
Unlike Kant, I think that there are non-predicative concepts, like schematic that or I, and like canonical singular <br>
concepts, 0, God, and addition. Kant’s emphasis on judgment, a propositional capacity, is original and important.<br>

362 I say that <i>most</i> noun-phrases are not iconic. Obviously, there are sign languages and picture-based lan-<br>
guages that retain substantial iconic elements. In fact, non-iconic linguistic symbols probably developed out of <br>
iconic signs and iconic symbols by processes of simplification and abstraction, supported by conventional co ord-<br>
