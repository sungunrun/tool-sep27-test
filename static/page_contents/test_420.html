420 Intra-Saccadic Perception and Recurrent Processing</div>
<br><br>
pre-frontal areas join temporal areas to provide stored perceptual information. Such per-<br>
ceptual memory is a source of anticipation of, as well as interaction with, processing for <br>
categorization and object recognition that are supported in IT.516 Pre-frontal areas house <br>
some forms of visual working memory.517 Again, interaction with perceptual memory <br>
during perceptual processing occurs after the initial dominantly feed-forward burst. I dis-<br>
cuss these matters in more detail in the next section of this chapter and in Chapters 15–17.<br>
<br>
The pre-frontal cortex figures in many high-level psychological activities, such as <br>
prop os ition al thinking. It also figures in these basic aspects of visual representation: eye <br>
movement, attention to visual targets, enhancing object categorization.<br>
<br>
The foregoing is a highly schematized sketch of brain circuits underlying visual pro-<br>
cessing. Nearly all brain areas are connected to nearly all others. All or nearly all these <br>
connections are reciprocal, yielding constant feedback as well as feed-forward processing. <br>
All the mentioned areas subdivide into sub-areas. So the information traffic map is vastly <br>
more complex and multi-routed than the sketch suggests. Brain areas cited as specializing <br>
in supporting certain perceptual functions always have other perception-supporting sub-<br>
specializations that grow more prominent in some circumstances via effects of attention. <br>
A given type of specialized processing commonly occurs in many areas. The dorsal and <br>
ventral streams are connected from the outset of their divergence at V1. Strong inter-<br>
stream connections are in place from V2 onwards. Inter-connections among V3, the <br>
temporal area, and the pre-frontal area are examples.<br>
<br>
Feedback routes accompany feed-forward routes. Feedback is initiated from both <br>
adjacent and distant areas. Because of ubiquitous interconnection, no area is entirely <br>
encapsulated or single-purpose. The sketch is meant to frame further discussion—espe-<br>
cially of timing, perceptual constancies, and connections among perception and satellite <br>
capacities, such as memory.<br><br>

<b>Timing of Visual Processing; Some Main Types of Representation<br><br>
</div>
</b>I now retrace geography of processing, attending to timing. I sketch probable emergence <br>
of some key perceptual constancies. In distinguishing perceptual representation from pre-<br>
perceptual information registration, they mark the lower boundary of the most important <br>
psychological kind—representation, the kind marked by veridicality conditions as an <br>
aspect of a state’s nature. Although the boundary is not sharp, the distinction is recognized <br>
in the science.<br>
<br>
This discussion provides a frame for understanding the network of psychological kinds <br>
that immediately surround perception—perceptual attention, perceptually guided con-<br>
ation, perceptual memory, perceptual anticipation, perceptual imagery, and perceptual <br><br>
