shown. Relevant beliefs are the causal products of low-level associations in perception and <br>
perceptual memory between certain shapes and certain colors—and in the case of apples, <br>
certain words. It is plausible—and certainly has not been shown not to be true—that these <br>
associations are the causes of both the beliefs and the primed, misperceptions by the visual <br>
system. If the beliefs lapsed and these associations remained, the bias of color perception <br>
toward red would surely remain.<br>
<br>
A similar point applies to MacPherson’s postulation of cognitive penetration by the <br>
state of having the concept red. It is plausible—and has not been shown not to be true—<br>
that the causal agent in producing the biased perception is the <i>perceptual</i> attributive red, <br>
and its association with perceptual attributives for certain shapes. There certainly <i>are</i> non-<br>
cognitive, perceptual-level associations between shape and color. Literally nothing has <br>
been adduced to show that they are not causal agents that ground the biased perceptual <br>
responses. Empirical work in this area repeatedly cites low-level associations as causes of <br>
perceptual priming and bias. (See Chapter 16, the section Priming and Memory; <br>
Chapter 18, the section Perceptual Learning.) There are specific reasons associated <br>
with details of the experiments that strongly suggest that a causal sequence involving low-<br>
level, non-cognitive associations are at the root of the perceptual biases.1109 Perceptual-<br>
level associations between color and shape representations that are stored in memory and <br>
that distort perceptual representation are not cognitive penetrators of visual processing, or <br>
visual experience.1110<br>
<br>
The primary point is that it has not been made plausible that belief plays any crucial <br>
role in the causation of these perceptual biases. As I indicate later, I think that even if it <br>
were to play a role, the sense in which it “penetrates” any aspect of the visual system does <br>
not bear much on understanding the nature of perceptual systems.<br><br>

<b>Framework Issues<br><br>
</div>
</b>My main interest is not whether MacPherson makes a case for cognitive penetration. <br>
I focus on the framework in which the case is made. It is a common framework. Her pres-<br>
entation stands out in making it explicit. I highlight four framework issues.<br>
<br>
First, the article centers on cognitive penetration of visual <i>experience</i>. MacPherson’s <br>
understanding of this notion is never articulated, but it is clear that she associates it with <br>
consciousness. She claims that ‘in philosophy and in psychology, the claim that perception <br>
is cognitively impenetrable is <i>usually</i> taken to be one about perceptual experience’.1111<br><br>
