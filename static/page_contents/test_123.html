include perceptual memory and perceptual anticipation—must have representational <br>
capacities in addition to those for perceptually representing the shapes, sizes, colors, <br>
motions that trigger A+; and, in some situations, these further cap aci ties must be able to <br>
operate differently, in applying an attributive for <i>A+</i>, from the way capacities for applying <br>
the other attributives figure in triggering it.<br>
<br>
The methodology for determining what attributives are <i>perceptual</i> attributives that rests <br>
partly on the foregoing method will be central throughout the book. It is central to our <br>
discussion of categorization. It figures prominently in Chapter 12’s discussion of attribu-<br>
tives for certain natural kinds, functional attributives (like danger or food), and the attrib-<br>
utives cause and agent.<br>
<br>
This methodology is important in its application to certain <i>natural kind</i> attributives. <br>
Physical natural kinds are usually distinguished by properties that are not directly sen sor-<br>
ily discriminable. Something could look and act like a dog and not be a dog. <i>Being a dog</i> is <br>
simply not the same property as <i>being a body with a characteristic dog-shape and dog-<br>
motion</i>. A natural-kind attributive for <i>dog</i> is true of what is in fact a natural kind. Both <br>
properties are prevalent in the environment. So, by the methodology, to have an attribu-<br>
tive for <i>dog</i>, one must have richer capacities than a capacity to distinguish bodies with <br>
shapes and motions characteristic of dogs.<br>
<br>
Since attributives are capacities, to have such a natural-kind attributive, an individual <br>
must have capacities that differ—are additional to—capacities to attribute a type of body <br>
with a certain characteristic shape, size, and/or motion. The individual need not know a <br>
natural kind’s constitutive structure in order to have an attributive for it. But the individual <br>
must be sensitive to the distinction between something’s being an <i>X</i> and something’s <br>
(veridically) perceptually appearing, or looking, just like an <i>X</i>. Natural biological and <br>
chemical kinds are what they are <i>not</i> by virtue of their perceivable qualities, but by virtue <br>
of their constitution, or in the case of biological kinds, perhaps their evolutionary history. <br>
A competence to attribute such a natural kind must be associated with a sensitivity or <br>
openness to finding that something that is perceptually indiscernible from an instance of <br>
the kind is <i>not</i> an instance of the kind. Such a sensitivity is a supra-perceptual capacity.<br>
<br>
Similarly, <i>water</i> is a natural kind. It is not water by virtue of how it looks, tastes, and <br>
perceivably behaves. It is water by virtue of its chemical composition. To represent water as <br>
water—as distinguished from representing water as a clear drinkable liquid, one need not <br>
know that <i>water</i> is a natural kind, much less know its constitutive features. Aristotle used <br>
water and air, thinking both applied to elements, whereas only water applies to a natural <br>
kind. Air is only a mixture of natural kinds. Still, Aristotle had attributives for <i>water</i> and <i>air</i>.<br>
<br>
Part of acquiring relevant natural kind representations is being open to something’s <br>
veridically looking like <i>X</i> but not being <i>X</i>. Such sensitivity seems virtually universal among <br>
adult humans. It develops at about 3–4 years of age in human children.130<br>
<br>
I think that this sort of sensitivity or openness is never a <i>perceptual</i> or <i>perceptual-level</i> <br>
capacity. Perceptual or perceptual-level capacities (which include perception, perceptual <br>
memory, and perceptual anticipation) <i>cannot</i> be sensitive to the possibility that something <br>
is what it is by virtue of some feature that is not, and cannot be, perceptually represented. <br><br>
