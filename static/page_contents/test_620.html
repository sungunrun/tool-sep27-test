episodic. There is evidence that non-human animals have episodic memories. No one <br>
knows whether the memories are consciously accessible.969 I focus on form and function, <br>
not consciousness.<br>
<br>
Tulving conjectured that episodic memory is unique to humans. The conjecture is <br>
widely disputed. The dispute is marked by difficulty in testing non-human memory of <br>
specific events for <i>consciousness</i>. Animal psychologists, also, take form and function, not <br>
consciousness, as primary.<br>
<br>
Episodic memory evolved more recently than other memory systems. It is more vulner-<br>
able to deficits from disease, injury, and aging, than the ability-general type. Episodic <br>
memory emerges late in child development, possibly not until 24 months. This late emer-<br>
gence underlies human inability consciously to remember events in earliest childhood. <br>
Episodic memory can be perceptual or conceptual. Perceptual forms are surely basic.<br>
<br>
Episodic memories usually rely on memory for context. They are at least partly neurally <br>
grounded in the medial temporal cortex, especially the hippocampal, mapping area. The <br>
pre-frontal cortex supports retrieval and may add to the associations supported in the <br>
medial temporal cortex. Although episodic memory evolved late, its main operations (for-<br>
mation and retrieval) do not evince a level of representation more sophisticated than that <br>
of perception. The primary formation operations are associational, including higher-order <br>
associations.970 Episodic memory is conceptual when it retains concepts applied in per-<br>
ceptual episodes. The concepts may be conceptualizations of perceptual attributives. Or <br>
they may be formed by association with perceptual attributives, as long as they were <br>
applied on the occasion of a particular past episode. Episodic memory that functions to <br>
retain perceptual content is perceptual-level representation.<br>
<br>
I turn to the representational <i>form</i> of episodic memory.<br>
<br>
Perceptual episodic memory contains occurrence-based referential applications pur-<br>
portedly to particulars. Whether or not successful, the presence of referential applications <br>
in episodic memory signals that episodic memory <i>functions</i> to be <i>de re</i>, hence is formally <br>
<i>de re</i>. What distinguishes it from other formally <i>de re</i> long-term perceptual memory is <br>
that it represents referred-to particulars, usually with some loss of detail, using specific <br>
attributives of a perceptual state or states from which it derives.<br>
<br>
There is inevitably some vagueness in this specification. It does not answer whether, <br>
if the memory derives from many diverse perceptions and different perceptions’ attrib-<br>
utives differ, the memory can take some attributives from one perceptual state and <br>
 others from another. Probably best to be liberal here. It does not answer whether slip-<br>
page is allowed, so that memory attributives are close approximations to the attribu-<br>
tives in the original perceptual states. Again, I favor liberality. Probably a spectrum of <br><br>
