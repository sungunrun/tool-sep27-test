criticism of rejections of (aa1) and (aa2) 151</div>
<br><br>
There is quite a lot wrong with these claims. In the first place, Schellenberg misrepre-<br>
sents my view in several demonstrable ways. As I have indicated, occurrent singular refer-<br>
ential applications dominate the representational content of perceptual states. The quoted <br>
passage mentions singular representations, but seems not to take in their centrality. The <br>
claims that for me ‘ . . . the fundamental structure of perception is attributive or predicative’ <br>
and ‘[p]erceptual content stems from attributing general features to objects’ are at best <br>
seriously misleading. They neglect the central element in perceptual representational con-<br>
tent: referential application. Perceptual representational content constitutively depends on <br>
occurrent singular, referential applications. ‘Attributing general features to objects’ sub-<br>
serves the referential applications. The content stems from both attributives and singular <br>
applications, and the fundamental structure of perception is referential, not attributive.163 <br>
The occurrent referential applications are functionally and semantically more fundamen-<br>
tal than the attributions, although the attributions are indispensable.<br>
<br>
Attribution aids the dominant function of perceptually picking out particulars—per-<br>
ceptual reference. It is in that way subsidiary. The dominance of reference is reflected in <br>
the form of perceptual representational contents. The form is scope-dominated by one or <br>
more referential applications. According to (AA2), <i>some</i> accurate attribution is constitu-<br>
tively necessary to every successful perception of a particular. Perceptual attribution serves <br>
perceptual reference.<br>
<br>
Schellenberg introduces her view, in opposition to mine, this way:<br><br>
I am not arguing that the fundamental structure of perception is attributive or predica-<br>
<br>
tive, but rather that the fundamental structure is a matter of employing perceptual cap-<br>
<br>
aci ties that function to single out particulars. (See note 162.)<br><br>
This claim is simply false in suggesting that on my view the ‘fundamental structure of per-<br>
ception is attributive or predicative’. The fundamental structure is referential. The claim is <br>
also confused in its attempt to state her putatively contrasting view: ‘the fundamental <br>
structure is a matter of employing perceptual capacities that function to single out par-<br>
ticulars’. My stated view has long been that the fundamental structure of perception is ‘a <br>
matter of employing perceptual capacities that function to single out particulars’. The rele-<br>
vant perceptual capacities are schematic singular perceptual capacities accompanied by <br>
attributive perceptual capacities that function to guide singular referential applications. <br>
Representational contents just are those capacities. Schellenberg’s unmoored, confused <br>
characterization, on very basic issues, marks the whole discussion of my work.<br>
<br>
Further, I do not hold that reference is only to “objects”, as Schellenberg claims.164 She <br>
contrasts objects with a variety of other particulars—property-instances, events, and so <br>
on, and takes herself to be thereby disagreeing with my view. She cites no passage in which <br>
I take any such position. One will search in vain for any such passage.<br><br>
