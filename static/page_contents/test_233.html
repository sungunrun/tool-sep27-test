attributive capacities are determined not just by their <i>representata</i>, but also by the cues <br>
that cause their formation. Of course, the cues themselves depend on the viewer’s position <br>
with respect to the <i>representata</i>.<br>
<br>
These considerations underlie the fact that minimalism is not a psychologically viable <br>
position. Frege’s insights into the distinction between representational content (for him, <br>
sense) and <i>representatum</i> (for him, <i>Bedeutung</i>) have analogs in distinguishing perceptual <br>
attributives from their <i>representata</i>—their indicants.<br><br>

<b>Perceptual Units in Packages in Iconic Visual Spatial Representation<br><br>
</div>
</b>When a visual system computes a representation of an edge of a surface, body, or texture, <br>
oriented in space, it produces one of its simplest representations of environmental at tri-<br>
butes. Suppose that the system can represent the magnitude (and approximate location) of <br>
the edge. Then the system plots positions of the endpoints of the edge, as well as positions <br>
of the visually discriminable parts of the edge. This computation <i>constitutes</i> computation <br>
of the edge’s length and shape, as well as computation of an attributive that specifies the <br>
figure as an edge.<br>
<br>
In such cases, an attributive for an edge, attributives for length, specific shape, and spe-<br>
cific orientation are all present in the same package. One cannot perceive an edge without <br>
perceiving it as having some approximate length (at least relative length to other edges), <br>
approximate shape, and approximate orientation. At close distances, edges are often per-<br>
ceived as having a specific length, specific shape, and specific orientation in 3-D space. <br>
Purely 2-D registrations of edges are pre-representational and non-perceptual. As we saw <br>
in Chapter 3, the section Retinal Image Contour Registration and Surface <br>
Contour Perception, perceptual constancies for edges take hold only when edges <br>
and surfaces are mapped in 3-D space. I discuss this <i>packaging</i> further in Chapter 9.<br>
<br>
Consider the edge’s perceptual shape representation. Plotting the position of every visu-<br>
ally discriminable part of the edge, relative to egocentric anchor position, provides repre-<br>
sentation of the edge’s shape. The edge representation is an attributional unit that <br>
systematically corresponds to the edge’s shape. The shape representation is embedded in a <br>
shape constancy. Attribution of shape is not a computation in addition to plotting the edge <br>
in 3-D space.<br>
<br>
Consider representation of the edge’s length. Assume that the edge is approximately <br>
straight, and that it is close enough to be perceived as having a specific length. Positions of <br>
the edge’s endpoints are specified. That distance, hence the edge’s length, is determined by <br>
locating the edge in the egocentrically anchored 3-D coordinate system. That specific <br>
length, the distance between endpoints, is often represented explicitly in the system, <br>
although there are often indeterminacies. If the edge is distant or occluded, or if the sys-<br>
tem can compute only the edge’s direction-from-viewer and ordinal depth, the system will <br>
not commit to a specific length.<br>
<br>
Suppose that the edge is a perceived unit. In situating it in the coordinate system, the <br>
system marks the edge’s end positions as occupied. Attribution of the approximate length <br>
of the edge is a consequence of locating edge endpoints in the coordinate system, assum-<br>
ing that the visual system’s application of the coordinate system is approximately accurate. <br>
Since length attribution is embedded in a length constancy, a perceptual system that </div>
