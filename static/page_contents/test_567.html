<b>Perceptual Memory I: Shorter Term Systems<br><br>
</div>
</b>. . . I see the awakening of consciousness as a series of spaced flashes, with the <br>
<br>
intervals between them gradually diminishing until bright blocks of percep-<br>
<br>
tion are formed, affording memory a slippery hold.<br>
<br>
Vladimir Nabokov, <i>Speak, Memory<br><br>
Memory</i>, as I understand the term, is a competence that functions to encode and retain rep-<br>
resentation for further use. As a matter of terminology, I do not count as memory those <br>
types of retention that preserve non-representational information—“muscle memory” and <br>
sub-perceptual sensory retention. I do not include a capacity for retrieval as constitutively <br>
associated with memory. Some memories operate only at unconscious levels, showing them-<br>
selves in behavior. Some, at least in lower animals, may be unretrievable into consciousness.<br>
<br>
Every perceptual modality—including vision, hearing, touch, proprioception—comes <br>
with two closely connected representational systems in the same modality: perceptual <br>
memory and perceptual anticipation. For example, in every known psychology that has <br>
visual perception, that capacity is coupled with at least some sort of short-term visual <br>
memory and some sort of visual anticipation. Some perceptual systems come with a sys-<br>
tem of perceptual imagining as well. Imagining may be absent in the psychologies of lower <br>
animals that have perception.<br>
<br>
Each of these generic representational functions—memory, anticipation, and imagin-<br>
ing—has a species that is functionally associated with perception. Each makes use of, and is <br>
parasitic on, a perceptual system in the same modality. In this and the next chapter, I discuss <br>
visual perceptual memory. In Chapter 18, I discuss visual anticipation and imagination.<br>
<br>
Main tasks in Chapters 16 and 17 are two. First, I survey perceptual-memory systems. <br>
Second, I extend the point made about categorization, conation, and attention: Memory comes <br>
in representational levels. Memory <i>per se</i> should not be regarded as cognition, where cognition <br>
is understood as a competence at a supra-perceptual level of representation that is more <br>
knowledge-like or more sophisticated than perception. Some memory is perceptual-level.<br>
<br>
Various types of visual memory are perceptual-level. All function to retain visual percep-<br>
tual attributives. Psychological <i>operations</i> involved in perceptual memory are in no way <br>
more sophisticated or more knowledge-like than operations that form perceptions. The vari-<br>
ous types of perceptual memory are part of the system of perceptual processing. Detailed <br>
descriptions of different types of visual memory are partly intended to support these points.<br>
<br>
Calling memory <i>cognition</i> has been encouraged by loose use of auxiliary terms. In the <br>
scientific literature, memory is regularly called ‘knowledge’.807 The effect of this usage is to <br>
over-intellectualize the psychological kind.<br><br>
