CSTM. After representations fade from the sensory icon (the conscious aspect of visual <br>
sensory memory), most are not easily consciously accessible. They nevertheless feed per-<br>
ceptual visual long-term memory. In fact, these latter inputs are a richer source of what is <br>
retained than those that are accessible in visual working memory.953<br>
<br>
Priming evinces contents in long-term memory that are not easily accessible to con-<br>
sciousness. Individuals are faster and more accurate in identifying a seen object that they <br>
have seen before, and in identifying an environment type of object or configuration of <br>
objects that they have seen before. Evidence of not easily accessible long-term memory <br>
also comes from forced-choice recognition and other sources, such as eye movement. <br>
Priming and forced-choice effects can be specific to details that were once visually per-<br>
ceived. The effects show up in performance over a year after initial perception.954 <br>
Unconsciously fed, long-term memories can remain intact despite serious deficits in long-<br>
term conscious recall. Some of these memories may not be retrievable into consciousness. <br>
They show their presence in affecting behavior.955<br>
<br>
Long-term memory has been mistakenly viewed as a repository only of purely abstract, <br>
even amodal or conceptual representations. It has been claimed that detailed images <br>
deriving from perception do not survive in long-term memory. Some of these claims stem <br>
from over-focus on accessible, on-demand conscious images. Image-based or template-<br>
based retrieval in long-term memory facilitates search and categorization independently <br>
of conceptual labeling of a searched-for item. The templates do not retain all the detail of <br>
perception. They are, however, rich in detail.956<br>
<br>
The mistaken view of long-term memory as always abstract has probably contributed to <br>
the mistaken view that long-term memory is, without qualification, a higher, cognitive <br>
competence—because of the half-baked empiricist idea that cognition is marked by <br>
abstraction. In fact, long-term memory functions to retain both conceptual and percep-<br>
tual representations. Neither need be abstract; both can be abstract. Both can also be <i>richly</i> <br>
iconic. Retained conceptual representations can be iconic or not. There is evidence that <br>
perceptual VLTM and perceptual WM share (iconic) format. There is no evidence that <br>
this format always depends on propositional capacities. Retained perceptual contents are <br>
always iconic, rich or not. Neither the representational contents of <i>perceptual</i> long-term <br>
memories nor the operations that yield those contents support taking LTM, without quali-<br>
fication, to be cognitive in a sense that would mark it as a supra-perceptual power.<br>
<br>
There may be causal relations from states retaining conceptual contents in LTM to <br>
states retaining perceptual contents in LTM. (There are certainly causal relations in the <br>
reverse direction.) There is, however, no evidence that such conceptual memories (hence <br>
propositional capacities) in LTM figure indispensably in the retention of perceptual con-<br>
tents in LTM. There is also no evidence that conceptual elements figure indispensably in <br><br>
