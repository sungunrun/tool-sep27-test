Executive Control System, Propositional Drivers 563</div>
<br><br>
So there is evidence that the executive control system can intervene in normally automatic <br>
default patterns of endogenous attention shifts and saccade commands. I think it ante-<br>
cedent ly plausible that this low-level individual control of eye movement is part of the <br>
visuomotor system. I argue the point below.<br>
<br>
When individuals control their attention and eye movements, the executive control sys-<br>
tem takes over the same functions that the automatic rules of attention and gaze shift ful-<br>
fill. I believe that in those cases, the part of the executive control system that governs <br>
representational states—attentional, perceptual, or conative—that use perceptual-level <br>
representation is itself a part of a perceptual-level visuomotor system.<br>
<br>
The executive control system initiates endogenous attention both before and during <br>
visual processing. Its operates not only through FEF. It is usually regarded as grounded in <br>
the parietal and frontal areas. Thus the second and third waves of recurrent processing, <br>
starting at 140–150 ms and 180–299 ms, discussed in Chapter 11, the section <br>
Categorization and Timing, carry attentional initiations from the executive con-<br>
trol system. Such initiations affect nearly all aspects of visual processing, from V1 through <br>
IT.804 Some of these higher areas (for example, pre-frontal areas), regarded generically, do <br>
support representational processing that is plausibly supra-perceptual. Insofar as supra-<br>
perceptual-level initiations of attention affect visual processing, I believe that they do so <br>
through operations that are typed in terms of perceptual-level capacities. Many of these <br>
operations are perceptual-level operations of the executive control system.<br>
<br>
In humans, attention that derives from propositional attitudes can affect what one <br>
attends to perceptually. Conceptual attention commands can co-opt default patterns of <br>
allocating visual attention at the perceptual level. Propositionally guided attention can <br>
thereby affect perceptual processing via perceptually guided attention. It can cause <br>
en dogen ous visual perceptual-level attention commands that are themselves part of the <br>
visuomotor system. I think that conceptual-level attention commands that yield shifts in <br>
visual perceptual attention always operate through perceptual-level attention commands. <br>
Representational ini ti ation of attention fits with the perceptual capacities that it affects. It <br>
specifies <i>representata</i> that are to be attended via capacities that naturally fit with and are <br>
connected to the perceptual capacities that are attentionally selected and boosted. Such <br>
specification involves an attention command’s specifying <i>representata</i> via <i>perceptual</i> <br>
attributives. This natural fit between attentional initiations and the perceptual states that <br>
are selectively boosted allows attentional initiations to be included in computational <br>
explanations of vision. Representationally initiated attention operates via perceptual-level <br>
attention commands.<br>
<br>
Philosophers tend to overstate how much endogenous attentional feedback into visual <br>
processing is driven by propositional or other supra-perceptual states. Much of the time, <br>
task-oriented, attention-boosting of perception operates without supra-perceptual-level <br>
drivers. Most of the feedback from attention, memory, and conative states into visual pro-<br>
cessing is not only perceptual-level and automatic. It lacks specific supra-perceptual causal <br>
antecedents. When there are such antecedents, they operate via perceptual-level <br>
 intermediaries. The computational models just discussed do not cite or need to cite <br><br>
