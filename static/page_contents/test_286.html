286 Egocentric Indexing</div>
<br><br>
I turn more briefly to a further objection to my account of conditions for temporal rep-<br>
resentation in perceptual states. Christopher Peacocke maintains that my conditions for <br>
taking perception to be temporally indexed are too permissive. Peacocke uses my distinc-<br>
tion between non-perceptual sensing and perceptual representation to argue that there are <br>
cases in which animal perceivers meet my condition of coordinating perception with tem-<br>
poral sensitivity, but in which they do not perceptually represent time, at least not time <br>
beyond the present.287<br>
<br>
Here is what I wrote, and still believe, about minimal conditions for temporal represen-<br>
tation in perception:<br><br>
I believe that, at least in actual animal life, the functioning of temporal sensitivity in <br>
<br>
 perception (and hence representational agency) is necessary and sufficient for temporal <br>
<br>
representation. A functioning psychological coordination of perception of <i>other matters</i> <br>
<br>
with temporal sensitivity is both necessary and sufficient for temporal representation in <br>
<br>
perception . . . . First, sufficiency. Suppose that an animal tracks a moving particular. The <br>
<br>
tracking relies on sensitivity to temporal order. The particular is represented as the same <br>
<br>
through the motion. The coordination of later perceptions with earlier perceptions in <br>
<br>
representing the particular depends on sensitivity to temporal order. Then temporal sen-<br>
<br>
sitivity is incorporated into perceptual representation of movement. One represents the <br>
<br>
particular’s being in one position as temporally after its being in the earlier position . . . . <br>
<br>
[I indicate that this co-ordination can occur within a single perceptual states, as well in <br>
<br>
perceptual memory.] Similar points apply to sensitivity to temporal intervals.288<br><br>
Peacocke is mainly concerned with the experience of temporal duration. I do not high-<br>
light conscious perception (experience). And duration is not the only temporal relation <br>
attributed in perception. Sensitivity to temporal order is more fundamental. He also writes <br>
repeatedly, without qualification, of perception of time. (See criticism of this view in <br>
Chapter 3, the section Visual Temporal Perceptual Constancies.) He passes, <br>
without comment, from writing of perception of duration to perception <i>that</i> two events <br>
are separated by a certain duration.289 I think that duration is not strictly perceived, and it <br>
is a serious philosophical and scientific mistake to conflate perceiving and perceiving-that. <br>
The latter is a mixture of perception and thought (conception). (See Chapter 12, the section <br>
Methodology for Finding Perceptual Attributives.)<br><br>

<b>Cont FN</b>287 Peacocke, <i>The Primacy of Metaphysics</i>, 85–91. See also discussion of Peacocke’s criticisms of my views on <br>
perceptual temporal attribution, Chapter 3, the section Visual Temporal Perceptual Constancies. As <br>
Gross recognizes, I do not <i>assume</i> that perceptual states are present-tensed. I argue that they are, by giving them <br>
a contrasting function to past-tense representation in perceptual memory. Peacocke takes it for granted that <br>
perceptual states are present-tensed and focuses on what conditions allow perception to represent temporal <br>
magnitudes.<br>
288 Burge, <i>Origins of Objectivity</i>, 521 (emphasis in original). In the same passage, I write, ‘incorporation of <br>
temporal order in perception of change or movement is probably the simplest sort of temporal representation in <br>
perception’. As Gross in effect points out in his example, temporal order can be harnessed by perception even in <br>
cases in which there is no representation of change. Whether that case, involving very short-term memory, is <br>
simpler than a case of representation of change, perhaps motion, within a single perceptual state, seems unclear. <br>
Coordination occurs in both cases. The coordination includes that between perception and use states laid out in <br>
the argument above.<br>
289 Peacocke, <i>The Primacy of Metaphysics</i>, 72–73. Peacocke also argues that perceptual temporal representa-<br>
tion need not be associated with perceptual constancies, as I think it must be. For argument that this line of <br>
objection fails, see Chapter 3, the section Visual Temporal Perceptual Constancies.</div>
