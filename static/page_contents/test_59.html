Perception as Objectification 59</div>

representational contents that provide different perceptual perspectives on a particular or <br>
attribute.<br>
<br>
So each perceptual state that figures in a perceptual constancy represents the en vir on-<br>
mental element (particular or attribute) that objectification yields. The system of state-<br>
types that make up a perceptual constancy holds together different perspectives, which <br>
derive from different stimulus conditions, in different representational contents of states <br>
in the constancy. Each state in a perceptual constancy represents a given particular or <br>
attribute as that particular or attribute in a representationally different way. This dual <br>
aspect of perceptual representation is basic to the form, content, and semantics of percep-<br>
tual states. These matters occupy Chapters 5–8.<br>
<br>
I stated that I think that perceptual constancies depend constitutively on ob ject ifi ca-<br>
tion. Here is an articulation of this view.<br>
<br>
A perceptual constancy is a capacity to represent a given distal environmental, or bod-<br>
ily, attribute or particular <i>as</i> that attribute or particular despite significant variation in <br>
proximal stimulation. Suppose that a creature’s system does not separate aspects of prox-<br>
imal stimulation that bear more on patterns in the proximal stimulus from aspects that <br>
bear on distal aspects of the environment. Given lack of such objectification, the creature’s <br>
sensory state would correlate better with aspects of proximal stimulation than with at tri-<br>
butes or particulars in the distal environment. On such a supposition, the science would <br>
not have a ground to take the sensory state as perceptual or as representing distal aspects <br>
of the environment. It would not give causal explanations that take the state as being <br>
ac cur ate or inaccurate in virtue of the existence and properties of any distal environmental <br>
entity. It would not identify the sensory state, even partly, in terms of any distal en vir on-<br>
mental entity (as a perception as of red, or as of being cubical, would). Nor should it. The <br>
identity of the sensory state hinges on its role in causal patterns that are law-like and that <br>
ground explanation. If a sensory state is not associated with a capacity specific to a distal <br>
environmental attribute or particular, at least in a wide range of circumstances, a capacity <br>
that is distinguishable from its responding to being caused by a specific, perhaps relatively <br>
abstract type of proximal stimulation, then there is no basis for taking it to represent the <br>
distal environmental attribute or particular. For the kind and causal role of the state can be <br>
completely accounted for in terms of its being caused by proximal stimulation and its <br>
causal relations to other sensory states.<br>
<br>
In each case, any given proximal stimulation has indefinitely many distal antecedents. <br>
There is the putative <i>representatum</i> and the proximal stimulus. There are stimuli (for <br>
example, arrays of light) at various distances between that <i>representatum</i> and the proximal <br>
stimulus. Since the initial sensory states are not associated with a capacity to connect to <br>
any distal attribute or particular in a way that distinguishes that connection from connec-<br>
tion to the specific type of proximal stimulus (or closely related types), there is no ground <br>
to identify the state as specific to (as representing) any one of the distal causes antecedent <br>
to the proximal stimulus. So such states do not represent any distal attribute or particular. <br>
They lack perceptual objectification. They are information registrations of the proximal <br>
stimulus and of types distal antecedents of the proximal stimulus that regularly cause the <br>
proximal stimulus. They can function biologically to register several of these stimuli. But <br>
none of the distal antecedents is as relevant to <i>causal</i> explanations of those states’ occur-<br>
rences as the proximal stimulus is. The sensory states’ identities in grounding causal <br>
ex plan ation are determined by their relations to proximal stimulation. Relations to types </div>
