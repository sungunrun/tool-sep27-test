instances cannot be perceived. One does not perceive a magnitude of a distance or any <br>
instance of the distance itself in space. One does not perceive an ordinal depth relation. <br>
One perceptually attributes such distances and depths. The distance and ordinal depth con-<br>
stancies depend on applied constancies for spatial properties, or perhaps constancies for <br>
other attributes, whose instances <i>can</i> be perceived. One sees something <i>as being</i> at a certain <br>
distance or ordinal depth only by seeing something with a certain shape and size at that <br>
distance—or by seeing two somethings, one of which is perceived <i>as</i> closer than the other.<br>
<br>
Duration is sometimes perhaps a temporal property of an event. Duration can also be a <br>
relation between events, or times. The temporal perceptual constancies that I focus on <br>
here are relational framework constancies.<br>
<br>
Analogously to the case of relational spatial perceptual constancies, relational temporal <br>
perceptual constancies depend on constancies for properties of particulars perceived <i>in</i> <br>
time. One does not perceive time, temporal moments, or temporal relations. They lack <br>
relevant causal powers to affect sensors and set up causal chains that connect perceived <br>
particulars with perceptions of them. Times are indexed and measured in perception, and <br>
temporal relations are attributed. They are attributed to perceived particulars. ‘Perception <br>
of time’ is a misleading short-hand for these perceptual operations.<br>
<br>
Visual perceptual attribution of ordinal depth or distance depends on perceptual attri-<br>
bution that functions to be to one or more particulars <i>in</i> space at a depth or distance. <br>
Visual, perceptual temporal attribution depends on other perceptual attribution that func-<br>
tions to be to one or more particulars <i>in</i> time. Perceptually attributed temporal relations <br>
can hold between an indexed time (a time anchor like that produced in present tense) and <br>
a time related to a perceived entity, or between times each of which is related to a different <br>
perceived entity.<br>
<br>
So a perceptual constancy for a temporal relation is a capacity to perceptually attribute <br>
a temporal relation between perceived entities, or stages of a perceived process, despite <br>
significant variation in proximal stimulation. The variation in proximal stimulation is not <br>
variation through a constant perception of time, because there is no perception of time or <br>
times. It will be variation in proximal stimulation in the picking out a particular (or par-<br>
ticulars), or in attribution of a property to something perceived as in time, through con-<br>
stant perceptual attribution of a temporal relation. Thus, relational temporal perceptual <br>
constancies are derivative from perceptual constancies for other entities besides times and <br>
temporal relations.<br>
<br>
In a relational temporal perceptual constancy, the perceptual attributive indicates a <br>
temporal order or magnitude, which is entirely objective. There is no referential applica-<br>
tion to that order or magnitude. For the temporal order or interval is not perceived. The <br>
attributive functions to attribute that order or magnitude to one or more perceived <br>
particulars.<br>
<br>
Just as non-perceptual navigation of space can be virtuosic, so non-perceptual timing of <br>
order, intervals, and cycles can be remarkable. Multitudes of organisms track time with no <br>
perceptual capacities at all. Even in perceivers, many timing mechanisms are non-<br>
perceptual. Temporal sensing becomes temporal perception when and only when tem-<br>
poral sensing capacities are coordinated with the timing of perception of and perceptual <br>
attribution to particulars <i>in</i> time.<br>
<br>
When temporal sensitivity is incorporated into perception, it need not and probably <br>
usually does not, take on a different form or greater power. Perception tends to use timing </div>
