demonstrative-based thoughts on such perceptions to think about those objects. <br>
Consciousness is not essential to <i>de re</i> empirical thought. Competencies to form percep-<br>
tions and perceptual beliefs are.<br>
<br>
A second failure in the argument lies in its illegitimate comparison of super-<br>
blindsight, on one hand, with attempts to understand the linguistic demonstrative ref-<br>
erences of <i>another</i> individual who gives no cues as to which thing she ‘means’ or <br>
demonstratively refers to in thought, on the other hand. There is no mechanism or <br>
competence that, lacking such cues, could enable one to track which face another indi-<br>
vidual means. We do not read others’ minds except through perceived cues. Absent <br>
such cues and absent a relevant competence and mechanism, getting right what another <br>
person means <i>is</i> guessing. Campbell’s hearer has no route to track the other’s demon-<br>
strative usage, or to replicate it in thought. Here attribution of guessing is plausible. But <br>
this situation differs from both blindsight and super-blindsight. Blindseers and super-<br>
blindseers have a known competence and approximately known mechanism for navi-<br>
gating the world. Super-blindseers understand the demonstratives in their thoughts in <br>
the only sense that is necessary for demonstrative reference. They are competent in <br>
picking out objects through perception and through perception-based demonstrative <br>
thought.<br>
<br>
The goal of Campbell’s argument is to show that consciousness is necessary for blind-<br>
seers’ use of demonstratives in thought. The example should have exhibited a case in which <br>
demonstrative thought is absent and the only feature that can account for its absence is <br>
absence of consciousness. In the thought experiment, not only is consciousness absent. <br>
Also absent is any competence or mechanism for following and replicating the other per-<br>
son’s demonstrative reference. This latter absence suffices to explain the hearer’s failure to <br>
think demonstratively about what the speaker means. Campbell’s drawing his conclusion <br>
from his example is a <i>non sequitur</i>.<br>
<br>
Campbell frames the discussion as if it concerned linguistic understanding. The <br>
 relevant understanding is a perception-based intellectual competence to rely on per-<br>
ception in contextually picking out objects in thought. The super-blindseer has a com-<br>
petence to think perception-based thoughts. The thoughts are just as <i>de re</i> and <br>
demonstrative-governed as the perceptions are. The perceptions are <i>de re</i> and involve <br>
demonstrative-like referential applications. The perceptions pick out objects by <br>
contextual-causal means, embedded in perceptual constancies. The super-blindseer is <br>
competent in unconsciously picking out objects. Demonstrative-like referential appli-<br>
cations in perceptual belief and perception-based thought are automatically formed <br>
from counterpart applications in perception. A competence to consciously pick out <br>
objects and consciously focus on them is not necessary for picking out objects <i>de re</i> in <br>
perceptual belief.482<br><br>

<b>FOOTNOTES</b><br>
<b>Cont FN</b>482 Some of Campbell’s argument rests on the entirely armchair claim that a blindseer <i>only</i> perceives func-<br>
tional properties, “affordances”: Campbell, <i>Reference and Consciousness</i>, 138–145. It is an open empirical question <br>
whether <i>any</i> functional attributives are produced in the visual system (as distinguished from the actional sys-<br>
tem), though I assume here and elsewhere that some are. (See Chapter 12.) Campbell’s claim is, however, flatly <br>
incompatible with science. Vision science never takes perceptual attribution of functional properties to be <br>
entirely independent of perceptual attribution of “categoreal” properties like shape. Shape attribution is certainly <br>
computed first. One can perceive something as prey only by perceiving it as having attributes like specific shape, <br>
size, and motion.</div>
