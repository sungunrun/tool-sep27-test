Constancies and Frege’s Sense vs– <i>Bedeutung</i> Similarities 211</div>
<br><br>
In our example, the same property, (environmental) <i>edge</i>, perhaps even the same <br>
instance of <i>edge</i>, is perceptually represented in both stimulus conditions. In both condi-<br>
tions, the attribute-type <i>edge</i> is indicated and attributed to a particular edge (it may or may <br>
not be the same edge, the constant here is the attribute). Similarly, for the length. The per-<br>
ceiver sees an edge as an edge with length <i>l</i> in both conditions.<br>
<br>
The indication of a given attribute is analogous to the constancy in reference in (a-b). <br>
The difference in attributives is analogous to the difference in senses in (a-b).<br>
<br>
The analogy is so important that I illustrate it with another case. I provide arguments to <br>
support the broadly Fregean understanding of the case.<br>
<br>
Suppose that I veridically perceive instance <i>i</i> of color-shade <i>C</i> (a shade of red) as being <br>
<i>C</i>, where the color shade is illuminated by white light. 330 milliseconds later I veridically <br>
perceive <i>i</i> as <i>C</i>, and the illumination stays the same.204 Suppose that the <i>types</i> of percep-<br>
tions formed at the two times are the same. The key point here is that the ability-general <br>
aspects of the representational contents, the perceptual attributives, in the two occurrent <br>
perceptual states are the same. The perceiver continues to view the unchanged scene in the <br>
same way at the two times.<br>
<br>
Compare that mundane situation with this exercise of color constancy. I veridically per-<br>
ceive an instance <i>i</i> of color-shade <i>C</i> (a shade of red) as being <i>C</i>, where the color shade is <br>
illuminated by white light. I continue 330 ms later to veridically perceive <i>i</i> as being <i>C</i>, <br>
where the color shade <i>C</i> is illuminated by blue light. In this exercise of color constancy, the <br><br>

<b>FOOTNOTES</b><br>
<b>Cont FN</b>204 I choose 330 ms because, given that it is likely that there is a saccade after that interval, it is natural to <br>
assume that there is a succession of two perceptual-state-instances—however similar they are in type. As <br>
described in Chapter 16, the section Trans-Saccadic Memory, perceptual psychology follows this assump-<br>
tion. It takes a form of short-term memory to connect the successive perceptual states. In such successions there <br>
are usually small differences in the ability-general aspects of the two perceptual-state-instances, different at tribu-<br>
tives. Such differences are irrelevant to the larger points that I am making here.Aviewing geometrymode of presentation<br><br>
