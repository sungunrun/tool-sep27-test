function to be sustained by <i>present</i> stimulation. Holding that such instances lack the same <br>
representational content as perceptual attributives that occur in actual perceptual states <br>
would cripple science’s account of perceptual capacities as standing <i>competencies</i> involving <br>
perceptual-attributive kinds. Perceptual attributives enter into psychological patterns. A <br>
temporally pointillistic conception of perceptual attributives deprives them of their role as <br>
repeatable kinds that ground psychological explanation.<br>
<br>
One can distinguish perception from perceptual memory by holding that the former <br>
<i>mode</i>, but not the latter, functions to be causally sustained by current proximal stimula-<br>
tion. This is a distinction between modes. One cannot acceptably require that perceptual <br>
attributives in all their instances function occurrently to be sustained by current <br>
stimulation.<br>
<br>
Perceptual attributives differ from conceptual attributives in that, in every instance, <br>
their representational function in contributing to any veridicality condition into which <br>
they enter is to guide (or for relational perceptual attributives, to coordinate guidance of) <br>
referential applications.<br>
<br>
In instances in which they enter only into conditions for being veridical <i>of</i> entities, their <br>
function is to be disposed to guide or to have guided referential applications.<br>
<br>
For example, in perceptual states, one-place perceptual attributives function to guide <br>
referentially picking out presently perceived particulars or presently indexically anchored <br>
particulars. In perceptual states, relational perceptual attributives relate—coordinate—<br>
perceptual attributions that guide referential applications. In <i>de re</i> perceptual memory and <br>
<i>de re</i> perceptual anticipation, the same point holds. In schematic, ability-general percep-<br>
tual memories, which set only <i>veridicality-of</i> conditions, perceptual attributives function <br>
either to guide framework referential-application anchors or to retain guidance (or co ord-<br>
in ation of guidance) of past, but lost, referential applications in perception. In schematic, <br>
ability-general perceptual anticipations, perceptual attributives that do not guide current <br>
anchoring referential applications function to be disposed to guide future referential <br>
applications. In perceptual imagining, perceptual attributives guide referential applica-<br>
tions that mock picking out of particulars. In unexercised competencies, perceptual attrib-<br>
utives are disposed to take on the constitutive functions in guiding referential applications <br>
just described, when the competence is exercised.<br>
<br>
Some <i>instances</i> or <i>occurrences</i> of <i>conceptual</i> attributives function to be sustained by <br>
present stimulation and to contribute to veridicality conditions by guiding referential <br>
applications. <i>De re</i> conceptual referential applications can be guided by conceptual <br>
attributives. In the perceptual thought, that1 body is (that2) red, the conceptual attribu-<br>
tives body and red guide the referential applications (red makes both cross-and intra-<br>
attribute attributions; body, only an intra-attribute attribution), where body and red <br>
conceptualize perceptual attributives and are sustained by present stimulation. By con-<br>
trast, in the thought some body is red, using the same attributives, neither attributive <br>
functions to guide a referential application. Conceptual attributives necessarily have <br>
some uses, contributions to veridicality conditions, where their representational func-<br>
tion is <i>not</i> to guide referential application. They can take main-verb-phrase position in <br>
propositional structure, outside the scope of any referential application. Perceptual <br>
attributives cannot. They always function to guide or to be disposed, schematically to <br>
guide referential application.</div>
