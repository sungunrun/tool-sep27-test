120 Some BaSicS aBout PercePtion and PercePtual SyStemS</div>
<br><br>
For example, in a human or ape visual system, perceptual attribution of <i>body</i> as hav-<br>
ing a certain size, crescent-shape, and yellow color might trigger perceptual attribution <br>
of the functional property <i>food</i>. Or perception as of a moving shape of certain size <br>
might trigger perceptual attribution of the functional property, <i>danger</i>. A bee’s percep-<br>
tual system might group instances of certain upright colored shapes as destinations <br>
for landing.<br>
<br>
In general, functional attributes are attributed not by themselves, but via perceptual <br>
attribution of physical attributes.126 Food, danger, and other such functional properties <br>
must be determined perceptually by way of physical attributes that dangerous or edible <br>
entities commonly have. One does not perceive instances of functional properties neat.<br>
<br>
Although functional perceptual attributives can, in principle, be formed simultaneously <br>
with shape attributives, perceptual psychology does not take them to be formed before-<br>
hand. Indeed, it is hard to conceive how a functional property could be perceptually <br>
attributed, except by associating the function with some shape, size, motion, or color. The <br>
representational dependence of functional attributives on physical-attribute attributives is <br>
asymmetric.<br>
<br>
Many of the primary types of perceptual attributives are drummed into perceptual sys-<br>
tems through evolution. Learning can produce specific versions of attributives of these <br>
types. I see no principled apriori limit on what can be a perceptual attributive—except that <br>
the attribute must be sensorily discriminable by the system from other prevalent perceiv-<br>
able entities. Details of what attributives, including hierarchies of attributives, occur in a <br>
perceptual system are overwhelmingly empirical matters—to be determined through <br>
best-explanation consideration of individual cases.<br><br>

<b>Two Methodological Points About Natural-Kind <br>
<br>
and Functional Attributives<br><br>
</div>
</b>Recall from Chapter 3, the section ViSual SPatial PercePtual ConStancieS and <br>
Body Categorization, my stipulative use of hyphens, as in ‘dog-shaped’ or ‘x-ray-<br>
machine-body’. Hyphens are used to help indicate a sub-class of shapes or bodies. Visual <br>
systems distinguish such sub-classes via attribution of shape, size, and motion. Use of ‘dog’ <br>
and ‘x-ray-machine’ followed by a hyphen does not imply that the perceiver or the perceiver’s <br>
perceptual system has an attributive that attributes the kind <i>dog</i> or <i>x-ray machine</i>. The shape <br>
attributive groups as equivalent those shapes that are in fact shapes of dogs or x-ray <br>
machines, and attributes groupings of bodies on the basis of those shapes. The usage indi-<br>
cates that attribution individuated in the hyphen-indicated way does not imply distinctions <br>
that the hyphenated qualifier (‘dog’) implies when the term is used with ordinary under-<br>
standing of the term—distinctions between dogs and dog-shaped dog-bodies.<br>
<br>
One must distinguish perceptual attribution of shapes and shaped bodies from more <br>
familiar attributions of natural kinds like <i>dog</i> and attributions of functionally individuated <br><br>
