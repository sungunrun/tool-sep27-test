Wu aims to explain how an intention—say, an intention to search for clothing—penetrates <br>
the motor system and thereby penetrates visual processing. The motor system makes eye <br>
movement commands. The intentions are to look for clothing. Wu provides an intuitive <br>
sense in which the movements of the eyes (leading to corollary discharge that affects pro-<br>
cessing of movement and location attribution) implement the intention to look for cloth-<br>
ing. The visual processing yields a representation that locates surfaces or bodies with <br>
shapes that accord with the command to move the eyes to positions likely (on the basis of <br>
peripheral input) to contain clothing-like shapes.<br>
<br>
Wu compares implementation to a telephone conversation in which person <i>A</i> com-<br>
mands person <i>C</i> to bring a pipe and wear a hated tweed coat for a party. <i>A</i> serves up the <br>
command through an intermediary person <i>B</i>. <i>B</i> knows that <i>C</i> hates tweed and is not likely <br>
to comply unless the command is couched differently. <i>B</i> translates: wear the required coat. <br>
<i>B</i> drops the order of the pipe, knowing that <i>C</i> is not likely to bring it anyway, and empha-<br>
sizes social obligation rather than tweediness. Person <i>B</i> knows that <i>C</i> knows what the <br>
party’s requirements are. <i>C</i>’s bringing the tweed (required) coat is seen as implementing <br>
<i>A</i>’s order. Strangely, Wu comments that this case plausibly satisfies ‘talk of logical relation’. <br>
Although the commands are related in sensible ways, the connection between them is <br>
very far from a relation in logic.<br>
<br>
The ‘Transmitting Implementation’ condition (TI) sets three conditions:<br><br>
(TI)  (a) there is a causal relation between the affecting capacity or state I with content <i>p</i> <br>
<br>
and the penetrated state <i>C</i> with content <i>q</i>;<br>
<br>
(b) <i>q</i>’s being fulfilled would be a way of implementing <i>p</i> or part of <i>p</i>;<br>
<br>
(c) that for any state <i>M</i> that causally mediates between <i>C</i> and <i>I</i>, <i>M</i>’s content <i>r</i>’s being <br>
<br>
fulfilled implements <i>p</i> or the same part of <i>p</i> that would be implemented if we imple-<br>
<br>
mented <i>q</i>.1129<br><br>
(CC) and (TI) focus on the vaguer ideas of transference of information and implementa-<br>
tion of content, which certainly appear in Fodor and Pylyshyn. The conditions ignore the <br>
idea of what is <i>computed</i> by a system from a privileged database, or set of representational <br>
contents. I think that the conditions do not even capture what Fodor and Pylyshyn <br>
intended in vaguer remarks about causal access—for example, what Pylyshyn intended in <br>
writing of logical relation. Wu’s conditions certainly do not touch the second way Fodor <br>
says that a system can be encapsulated.1130<br>
<br>
I doubt that any informed person would take Wu’s explication of his example to sup-<br>
port a change in traditional understanding of vision. The fact that saccades can be <br>
en dogen ous ly controlled, indeed guided by intentions, has long been known by vision <br>
scientists. The fact that many visual attributions of location and motion depend on corol-<br>
lary discharges from motor commands that produce saccades has been known and <br><br>

<b>FOOTNOTES</b><br>
<b>FN</b>1129 The conditions are set out in Wu, ‘Visual Spatial Constancy and Modularity: Does Intention Penetrate <br>
Vision?’, 557, 664. Cecchi, ‘Cognitive Penetration, Perceptual Learning, and Neural Plasticity’, endorses Wu’s <br>
account of penetration.<br>
<b>FN</b>1130 Wu’s point that computations in visual processing use [cognitive] ‘information as a resource’ amounts to <br>
allowing that perceptual computations are sometimes causally and statistically related to cognitive antecedents. <br>
The point is compatible with but does not articulate the idea that what it is to be a visual system is to be a system <br>
of computations.</div>
