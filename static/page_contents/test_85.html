contour registration and contour perception 85</div>

Third, adjacent elements at orientations close enough to be above a given threshold are <br>
connected. If edge element <i>x</i> is adjacent to edge element <i>y</i>, and <i>x</i> and <i>y</i> are similar enough <br>
in orientation, by a specific criterion, they are connected. If element <i>x</i> is connected to <br>
elem ent <i>y</i> (by the relevant criterion), and element <i>y</i> is connected to element <i>z</i> (by the rele-<br>
vant criterion), then <i>x</i> and <i>z</i> are connected—by a computational rule of transitivity. <br>
Psychophysical experiments have discovered what counts as sufficient similarity in orien-<br>
tation, for purposes of the computation.80<br>
<br>
Of course, in actual visual perception of environmental contours (for example, contour <br>
edges of branches or rocks, or of patches of color on a surface), the contours are often partly <br>
occluded. A contour in the retinal image that corresponds to such physical contours is <br>
 broken, not continuous. The visual system needs a way of relating disconnected contours in <br>
the retinal image so as to maximize the probability that they correspond to en vir on men tal <br>
contours, including partly occluded ones. The last stage in the computation meets that need.<br>
<br>
Fourth, disconnected elements at orientations close enough to be above a given thresh-<br>
old are grouped (virtually connected) into a larger line or contour. Both the orientation of <br>
separated line segments and the polarity of luminance contrasts figure in the computation. <br>
For example, if the registration of lighter luminance is on the top of one line and on the <br>
bottom of another, it is less likely that the lines are grouped as belonging to the same con-<br>
tour. Retinal contours within a specific criterion of similarity of orientation within a cer-<br>
tain distance, and similarity of polarity of luminance contrasts, are grouped as line <br>
segments on a single contour in registering the retinal image, even though they are sep ar-<br>
ated from one another.<br>
<br>
Cues regarding orientation, distance, and polarity suffice to enable humans to come <br>
very close to the performance that an ideal observer would produce, given full access to <br>
the actual statistics governing contour continuation in natural scenes. Perceivers’ per form-<br>
ances closely track the statistics of optimally matching contour continuation in a ret inal <br>
image, as produced by contours in natural distal environmental scenes. In this computa-<br>
tion and in tests of human performance, no use is made of 3-D spatial information. In <br>
actual visual processing, such information comes to contribute to a later perceptual <br>
representation.<br><br>

<b>Cont FN</b>80 The criteria are determined by considering statistics of continuation in the physical environment as providing <br>
an optimum, then by checking perceptual performance against this optimum. Geisler’s work provides an elegant <br>
and powerful illustration of the method. See notes 24, 57, and 78.<b>Figure 3.1 </b>Geisler Contours.</div>
