accurately represents the shape. Nearly any psychologically relevant difference in stimuli <br>
will generate a different attributive, a different attributive aspect of a psychological state, <br>
even given that all the attributives in question attribute the same <i>representatum</i>. Each <br>
combination will yield a different psychological state (or different attributive contributor <br>
to a different psychological state) with its own psychological properties, such as properties <br>
of speed of formation and reliability for accuracy. But each state in a perceptual constancy <br>
represents <i>P</i> as such. So there are different visual perceptual attributives that indicate and <br>
attribute <i>P</i>.<br>
<br>
So far, I have mainly focused on visual perceptual attributives for non-relational, non-<br>
perspectival properties, like length, size, and shape. I have done so because the point is <br>
easiest to make intuitive, via illustrations like Figure 7.1. But the point that I have made for <br>
attributives for non-relational properties applies equally to attributives for relations. It <br>
applies to both perspectival relations, like <i>s in orientation o</i> [or <i>distance d</i>] <i>from ego-here</i>, <br>
and non-perspectival relations, like <i>x distance D from y</i>. Each perceptually indicated and <br>
attributable relation is represented by numerous perceptual attributives in any normal <br>
perceptual system. That is, there are psychologically distinct ways of attributing any given <br>
perceptually represented relation.<br>
<br>
For the way in which a specific relation is perceptually represented is derivative from <br>
the particular combination of cues from which the representation is computed. Since per-<br>
ceptual attribution of any given relation can derive from different cues in different com-<br>
bin ations, and since different psychological properties, such as speed of formation, speed <br>
of response, and reliability for being accurate, are inevitably associated with different cues <br>
in different combinations, there are numerous attributives for any given perceptually rep-<br>
resented relation. For example, a perceptual capacity <i>C</i> to attribute a given surface orien ta-<br>
tion generates its perceptual attributive faster or slower than do other perceptual capacities <br>
to attribute the same surface orientation, depending on different stimulus cues (or cue <br>
combinations), and different formation-transformations operating on the different cues <br>
(or cue combinations). Similarly, <i>C</i> will cause action at different speeds, and will have dif-<br>
ferent degrees of reliability in being accurateâ€”again depending on differences in stimulus <br>
cues. A perceptual attribution of the surface orientation that derives from lots of textural <br>
cues, and lots of gestalt cues, with all edges of the surface at a close distances and clearly <br>
visible, will be formed faster, and will be more reliably accurate, than a perceptual attribu-<br>
tion of the same relation that derives from fewer or no textural cues, and from edges that <br>
are partly occluded.<br>
<br>
Since perceptual representation of relations is less phenomenologically vivid than per-<br>
ceptual relations of non-relational properties, it may have seemed to minimalism that one <br>
could assume unique canonical representation of each perspectival relation that is percep-<br>
tually attributed. Then minimalism might have hoped to account for the seeming perspec-<br>
tival nature of attributives for non-perspectival, non-relational properties by associating <br>
each representation of such non-relational properties with a unique canonical representa-<br>
tion of a set of perspectival relations. But this strategy would have things backwards.<br>
<br>
Perceptual representation of relations always depends partly on sub-perceptual cues <br>
that cause computation of intra-attribute attributions of non-relational environmental <br>
properties. For example, perceptual attribution of a given orientation of a surface is com-<br>
puted from some combination of cues that derive from textural surface patterns, shadows, <br>
specularities on the surface or on the edges. Such cues contribute to computation of both </div>
