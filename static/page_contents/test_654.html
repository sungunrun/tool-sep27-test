654 Perception and Cognition</div>
<br><br>
Locke, maintained that differences among “ideas” occur entirely along a spectrum of <br>
degree of abstractness, or degree of clarity and distinctness.1058 Kant attacked this trad-<br>
ition, maintaining a basic distinction between intuitions and concepts. Empirical intuition <br>
is Kant’s analog of perception. He took empirical intuitions to be singular immediate <br>
(hence <i>de re</i>) representations. For him, concepts function constitutively as predicates in <br>
propositional judgment. Concepts are mediated, general representations.1059 Such a <br>
distinction remains dominant in modern scientific and philosophical thinking. Even <br>
independently of the debate over cognitive penetration, some psychologists have, I <br>
think usually unreflectively, held onto the Lockean idea that there is only a difference in <br>
degree of abstraction between perception and thought. A few take their views on cog-<br>
nitive penetration to support such a line, and to undercut any principled distinction <br>
between perception and thought.<br>
<br>
I take <i>concepts</i> to be ability-general, possibly but not necessarily attributive, capacities <br>
that function constitutively as non-propositional constituents in propositional representa-<br>
tional contents. <i>Perceptual attributives</i> are ability-general attributives that function to con-<br>
tribute to a perceptual, non-propositional representational content. (See Chapter 2, the <br>
section The Three Fundamental Representational Constituents in <br>
Perceptual States.) There is no evidence that the perceptual states’ representational <br>
content is propositional, and substantial evidence that it is not. (See Chapter 9.) There is <br>
massive evidence, most obviously in human linguistic behavior, that many psychological <br>
states <i>are</i> propositional. Propositional states are paradigmatically cognitive. So a distinc-<br>
tion between perception and perceptual-level capacities, on one hand, and propositional-<br>
level capacities, on the other, is well grounded. I delay until the section What Should <br>
Count as Cognition? discussing whether there is scientific ground to use the term <br>
‘cognitive’ for a psychological kind that includes non-propositional, supra-perceptual-<br>
level states together with propositional states.<br>
<br>
I do not take seriously the idea that there is <i>no</i> distinction between perception and con-<br>
ception, or perception and cognition. The divide between perceptual-level representation <br>
and propositional representation is solidly supported, deep, and principled.<br>
<br>
As indicated, I believe that the visual system and the visuo-motor system are unified <br>
systems, counting as natural psychological kinds. These systems include sub-systems that <br>
are themselves natural psychological kinds. There are definite distinctions between per-<br>
ception and its satellite capacities, on one hand, and anything appropriately called ‘cogni-<br>
tion’, on the other. I elaborated the point in Chapters 10–18.<br>
<br>
My focus in this chapter is not to save science from pseudo-threats to its objectivity. It is <br>
not to argue for a perception-thought distinction, a distinction that I think is already well-<br>
established. It is to refine our conception of central natural psychological kinds. I think <br>
that discussing issues of cognitive penetration may contribute to understanding notions of <br>
<i>perception</i>, <i>perceptual-level state</i>, <i>perceptual</i> or <i>perceptual-level system</i>, <i>cognition</i>, and <i>pene-<br>
tra tion</i>. These issues bear on first forms of mind—the topic that drives the book.<br><br>
