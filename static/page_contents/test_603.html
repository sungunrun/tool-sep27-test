of task-relevant attributions, or picked out as a target of interest, may be forgotten, often <br>
before they become consciously accessible.929<br>
<br>
Perceptual representations that are retained last for about 8 seconds, unless they are <br>
coded into long-term memory. Representations for many sequentially presented pictures <br>
can be retained, despite masking, each over the roughly 8 second period. Each retention of <br>
a perception of a picture has its own, roughly 8 second, duration. So one can think of a <br>
sequence as sitting sequentially on a conveyor belt, or assembly line, within the memory. <br>
Up to four pictures can be at the same stage on the assembly line. The sequence can be 6 to <br>
20 stages long, depending on presentation conditions.<br>
<br>
Attributions that are activated, but not formed into a structure, or otherwise not <br>
selected for further processing, are forgotten within a few hundreds of milliseconds. Initial <br>
attributions that do not fit into some pictorial or conceptual structure are unstable. So, for <br>
example, some detail in a picture is forgotten very quickly, though the richness of what is <br>
retained is impressive. In the case of a sequence that does not yield a structure, (such as <br>
sequence of unrelated words or a sequence of scenes that lack a targeted item), only a <br>
small part of the perceptual and initially retained perceptual information is consolidated. <br>
Remembering a more structured item can be aided by collaboration with antecedent <br>
structures in long-term memory. Consolidation into structured or otherwise significant <br>
items takes less than a half a second.930 Again, consolidated items are held in CSTM for <br>
approximately eight seconds. Those that pass into long-term memory are held much longer.<br>
<br>
Understanding rapid forgetting of perceived and briefly retained material was sharp-<br>
ened via further findings by Potter. If two cued targets are presented among distractors in <br>
a rapid (say, 10 per second) sequence of visual presentations, the two targets are likely to <br>
be identified and recalled, unless the second target is presented within 200–500 ms of <br>
onset of the first target. This interval, in which the second target is not responded to, is <br>
known as the <i>attentional blink</i>. The phenomenon is relevant to CSTM in that it shows the <br>
limits of selective processing and consolidation of new pre-set target-categorizations into <br>
CSTM. An initial categorical attribution occurs in 60–120 ms. If processing that attribu-<br>
tion into memory overlaps with occurrence of a second perceptual state that requires new <br>
categorization, processing the new categorization into memory is blocked or severely <br>
degraded. As discussed in Chapter 10, if the second perception is presented within 150 ms <br>
of the first, both can be recalled on demand. If the second perceptual state occurs in the <br>
200–500 ms window, CSTM cannot hold it.<br>
<br>
As its acronym indicates, Potter takes CSTM to retain conceptual representation as well <br>
as perceptual representation. What do she and her associates mean by ‘conceptual repre-<br>
sentation’? Word meanings are clear cases of concepts retained in CSTM. After words are <br>
presented to designate cue targets, their meanings are retained through the rapid serial <br>
presentation of pictures. The word meanings affect subsequent memory of pictures.931<br><br>
