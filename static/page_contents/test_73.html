Misguided approaches to perceptual constancies 73</div>
<br><br>
or ‘object-position constancy’—is a standard topic in the science. The claim that distance <br>
and location constancies are not recognized as perceptual constancies in the science is <br>
simply not true.67<br>
<br>
Distance constancy and location (or object-position) constancy differ importantly from <br>
lightness constancy. Distance is a relation. Lightness is a property. Although the authors <br>
write casually of perception of distance, I think that we do not literally perceive distance, <br>
or even instances of distance. We perceive particulars <i>as being</i> at a given distances, or <br>
or din al depths. By contrast, we perceive instances of lightness, color, shape, size, body. <br>
Instances of distance lack relevant powers to cause perception of them. Perceptual attribu-<br>
tions of distance are attributions of a relation to particulars—surfaces, color tropes, bod-<br>
ies—with respect to an egocentrically indexed anchor point. Similarly, one perceives one <br>
surface as closer than another from an anchor point.<br>
<br>
Distance constancy is a <i>framework constancy</i>. A framework constancy depends on <br>
other constancies for other attributes of particulars in a relational framework. One could <br>
not perceptually attribute a distance if one could not perceive instances of something else. <br>
As far as I know, all attributes for which there are framework constancies are relational.<br>
<br>
Distance constancy is integrated with constancies for attributes attributed to particulars <br>
as being at a given distance—normally in a spatial framework, where the framework is <br>
egocentrically anchored on the perceiver’s body. So the “significant differences” in prox-<br>
imal stimulation through which they yield constancies in representation are not only dif-<br>
ferences in proximal stimulation. They are also always differences in things perceived and <br>
types of things perceptually attributed. Framework-type perceptual constancies cannot be <br>
expected to be analogous in every respect to perceptual constancies for attributes of <br>
en tities that are perceived.<br>
<br>
The authors write that if distance constancy is taken to be a constancy ‘under the loose <br>
notion of constancy as just any sort of measurable stability through changes in proximal <br>
stimulation, constancy would extend to chemoreception, thermoreception, nocireception, <br>
and other cases where constancies are unnecessary’. This loose notion is not mine. The <br>
notion that the authors specify applies to any invariance, perceptual or not. I empha-<br>
sized—and here re-emphasize—that the notion of perceptual constancy is not that of just <br>
any constancy or invariance. The constancy or invariance must be perceptual. It must <br>
involve objectification. Distance invariances in vision are clearly invariances that <i>are</i> <br>
perceptual.<br>
<br>
The authors make the mistake of relying on unarticulated assumptions about what a <br>
perceptual constancy is. The assumptions appear to generalize from a very narrow base. <br>
Their conception of perceptual constancy is incompatible with standard usage in percep-<br>
tual psychology.<br>
<br>
Perceptual constancy is a natural kind found not by definition or antecedent char ac ter-<br>
iza tion, but by looking to perceptual science itself. A key factor is whether an invariance <br>
can be adequately explained as an invariance in proximal stimulation—as chemoreception <br>
and thermoreception are—or, to the contrary, as an invariance in response to some aspect <br>
of the distal environment. The latter case signals objectification. Distance constancies are <br><br>
