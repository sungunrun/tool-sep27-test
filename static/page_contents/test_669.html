Uses and Misuses of the Term ‘Cognition’ 669</div>

The point applies not just to gist memories’ effects on object categorization but also <br>
their effects on object recognition.1092 At the perceptual level, <i>object recognition</i> is just cat-<br>
egor iza tion of an object while connecting the categorization either with a (possibly non-<br>
representational) sense of familiarity or with a <i>de re</i>, fallible-tracking index-file from short-or <br>
long-term memory. Such connections are perceptual-level or lower. Computational models <br>
of perceptual object-recognition in later stages of perceptual processing are entirely <br>
perceptual-level.<br>
<br>
Although anatomical and neuro-psychological studies can contribute to guiding and <br>
constraining psychological theory, the psychological function of representational states, <br>
not anatomy, is dispositive in understanding the perceptual system. Psychological kinds <br>
must be understood in psychological terms. Virtually all the larger, anatomically dis tinct-<br>
ive brain areas that are known to support higher cognitive functions support perceptual <br>
functions as well. For example, the pre-frontal cortex supports clearly perceptual func-<br>
tions as well as reasoning via language. Similarly, the temporal cortex, which supports <br>
some of the most important perceptual constancies, also supports linguistic and other <br>
“cognitive” functions.<br>
<br>
Few psychologists or philosophers would, if pressed, defend a simple inference from <br>
broadly defined brain areas to type or level of representational function. The following <br>
type of admonition is common in the literature: ‘It is widely agreed that . . . [showing] that a <br>
cortical region is more responsive to one stimulus characteristic (such as color, depth, <br>
motion) than another does not imply that this region performs a single function, or that <br>
this function is computed only in this region.’1093 Nevertheless, there are widespread <br>
implicit assumptions that feedback from certain broad areas, like the pre-frontal cortex or <br>
parietal areas, grounds feedback from cognition into processing in the visual system. Such <br>
assumptions often blur perceptual and conceptual levels.<br>
<br>
A second use of ‘cognition’ that deserves criticism derives from outdated science. I dis-<br>
cussed the superceded claims in Chapter 10, the section Marr’s 2½-D Sketch. I review <br>
them here, focusing on a current use of ‘cognition’ that derives from them. A the or et ic al <br>
claim—common from the 1970s to the 1990s, first supported by David Marr, Shimon Ullman, <br>
and other founders of modern vision science, was that strictly perceptual processing gets only <br>
as far as a 2½-D sketch. The idea was that after that stage, some hybrid of “cognition” and per-<br>
ception takes over. The view held that bottom-up processing is almost exclusive until attribu-<br>
tives of surfaces are formed. All categorization was taken to be cognition. Bottom-up <br>
processing was seen as ‘involved in the analysis of the incoming image’. Top-down processes <br>
were seen to ‘originate with stored models and information associated with them’.1094 <br><br>
