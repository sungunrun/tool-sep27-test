</b>A Bird, came down the Walk— . . .<br>
<br>
I offered him a crumb,<br>
<br>
And he unrolled his feathers,<br>
<br>
And rowed him softer Home—<br>
<br>
Than Oars divide the Ocean,<br>
<br>
Too silver for a seam . . .<br>
<br>
Emily Dickinson, ‘A Bird Came Down the Walk’<br><br>
In this chapter, I discuss three further capacities that are auxiliaries of perception: learning, <br>
anticipation, and imagining. I center on perceptual-level species of the generic capacities.<br><br>

<b>Perceptual Learning<br><br>
</div>
</b>Perceptual learning is sometimes studied as if it were a self-standing phenomenon. Some <br>
perceptual learning resets perceptual processes directly. But quite a lot of perceptual learn-<br>
ing depends on perceptual memory.<br>
<br>
Psychologists who work on perceptual learning regard it as a sensory or perceptual phe-<br>
nom enon, not a cognitive phenomenon. The specifically perceptual constraints on rele-<br>
vant tasks and the locations of neural support motivate counting it perceptual. Since it is <br>
specialized to perception, it is often not even generalized associative learning, which in <br>
itself is not taken to be cognitive.978 So the practice—engaged in by some philosophers <br>
and a very few psychologists—of citing learning, without qualification, as a cognitive <br>
capacity is out of step with standard views in the sub-field. Being out of step has no con-<br>
ceptual or experimental justification.<br>
<br>
<i>Perceptual learning</i> is relatively stable change, usually improvement, in sensory acquisi-<br>
tion of information by a sensory perceptual system, as a result of sensory interaction with <br><br>
