As I explain in Chapter 16, I use the term ‘memory’ to apply only to a representational <br>
state. “Muscle memory” is a retention that I do not count as memory. The example postu-<br>
lates perceptual states. There is representational content to be retained over time, however <br>
brief: the time from one state to the next. The content of the use state shows that a memory <br>
state is formed. Memory just <i>is</i> a capacity to carry forward, preserve, or retain representa-<br>
tional content over time. That capacity is shown to be present by the fact that the use state <br>
includes the perceptual state’s attributive for color. Gross’s example appeals to intuitive <br>
psychology that takes postulation of memory to require some <i>substantial</i> time lag. As <br>
trans-saccadic memory illustrates, science does not place any such requirement. I think <br>
that science is thinking carefully and at a finer grain about relevant phenomena than intui-<br>
tive psychology does.<br>
<br>
In any case, postulating memory is not a momentous matter. I think that doing so is <br>
apriori necessary to accounting for the causing and guiding powers of perception, which <br>
are themselves apriori necessary.286 It is a mistake to think that invoking memory to <br>
understand the example is an otiose postulation. A correct description of the example <br>
<i>requires</i> acknowledgment that memory is involved. It is distinctive of memory that it is <br>
past-oriented—it is made accurate by events in a past—here, at a time before the memory <br>
is fully formed.<br>
<br>
The representational contents of all types of memory are past-tensed. Perceptual mem-<br>
ory content is made accurate or inaccurate by situations in the past—in this case, situ-<br>
ations that antedate the time of the use state and the memory state. The content is made <br>
accurate or inaccurate by the subject matter that the retained perceptual content repre-<br>
sents. That subject matter antedates the time of the memory.<br>
<br>
It is obvious on reflection, and certainly supported in the science, that a perception can <br>
be accurate and a succeeding perceptual or use state that functions to track the initial <br>
perception <i>could</i> be inaccurate because the situation changes. Consider the use state and <br>
the succeeding perceptual state (if any) that is contemporaneous with the use state. The <br>
referential applications that occur in these two states are not anaphorically connected to <br>
those in the first perceptual state—as the referential applications in the perceptual mem-<br>
ory may be. Any new perceptual state is controlled by new proximal stimulation that could <br>
come from new distal causes. The use state functions to produce a response that operates <br>
on the current situation. It is caused and guided by the original perceptual state and its <br>
succeeding perceptual memory. It is likely to be poised to rely on a contemporaneous sec-<br>
ond perception in carrying out its operation. (See note 285.) The use state and its contem-<br>
poraneous perceptual state function to represent the current situation (or perhaps a near <br>
future situation, for the use state). The initiating perception, and its memory, function to <br>
represent the earlier situation.<br><br>

<b>FOOTNOTES</b><br>
<b>Cont FN</b>286 A different consideration shows why postulating memory, when one postulates perception, is not a <br>
momentous step. (I do not need to rely on this consideration in the account.) It is apriori that sensory perceptual <br>
systems take in physical stimuli in a way that depends on the physical impacts of the stimuli on the perceptual <br>
systems’ sensory receptors. It is nearly apriori that physical stimulation of the physical receptors leaves a residue <br>
in the physical system as a perception is formed and after it is formed. This residue supports a residue-like reten-<br>
tion of the perceptual state. The memory begins to be formed during the duration of the perception. The reten-<br>
tion is visual sensory memory. (See Chapter 16, the section Visual Sensory Memory.) Visual sensory <br>
memory, as well as the perceptual state, figures in causal transitions between a perceptual state and a use state <br>
caused and guided by the perceptual state over a short-time lag.</div><div id="PGHEADER">
