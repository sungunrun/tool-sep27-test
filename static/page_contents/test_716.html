716 Perception and Cognition</div>

Although empiricist taxonomy is easily shown to be defective, empiricist ways of think-<br>
ing are very much alive among scientists. Scientists doing the most serious computational <br>
modeling in perceptual psychology are less susceptible. But intuitive appeals to abstrac-<br>
tion as a mark of the cognitive, or to similarity to concrete images as a mark of perception, <br>
are rife among psychologists who write about perception and cognition. The appeals tend <br>
not to take the form of explicit statements of principle. They are guided, however, by the <br>
empiricist picture: perception presents images; thought or cognition presents abstractions <br>
from such images. Relations among perceptual images are relations of similarity—usually <br>
intuitive similarity, open to phenomenological inspection. Representations too dissimilar <br>
to an image, by these standards, are taken to be poor candidates for perceptions and good <br>
candidates for cognition. Relevant notions of similarity and abstraction are not made <br>
explicit. Judgments guided by them are often errant. If such practice continues, progress in <br>
understanding the architecture of the mind will lag.<br>
<br>
Here is an example of the empiricist idea, expressed by the developmental psychologists <br>
Laura Namey and Deidre Genter:<br><br>
. . . there is considerable evidence that children’s categorization of objects is conceptually <br>
<br>
driven. Young children often categorize on the basis of deep, non-obvious conceptual <br>
<br>
aspects of objects such as function (e.g., can be eaten), causal properties (e.g., has eyes so <br>
<br>
it can see), and relations to other things in the world (e.g., grows on trees), and can also <br>
<br>
make inferences on the basis of such properties. In striking contrast to studies demon-<br>
<br>
strating children’s appreciation of the non-obvious aspects of category organization, <br>
<br>
many studies of children’s early naming suggest that children often rely primarily on per-<br>
<br>
ceptual features such as shape (e.g. round) and distinctive features (e.g., wheels) rather <br>
<br>
than on conceptual knowledge as a basis for categorization.1167<br><br>
The mistake here lies in thinking that one can determine from outside perceptual psych-<br>
ology what counts as a perceptual attribution or categorization. All three of the examples <br>
cited may well illustrate perceptual as well as conceptual capacities.<br>
<br>
It is an open question whether perceptual capacities include attributives for functional <br>
properties like <i>food</i> (or <i>edible</i>)<i>.</i> I think it likely that they do. There are certainly such attrib-<br>
utives in perceptual-level action systems, if not in perceptual systems as well. A perceptual <br>
attributive for food would have to have an application base in attributives for shape, size, <br>
motion, color, linked to dispositions to treat relevant bodies as edible. The application <br>
base could include different combinations of shapes, sizes, motions, colors—many of <br><br>

enormous number of articles in various areas of psychology that make similar assumptions about perception and <br>
conception, where conception is clearly taken to be supra-perceptual and cognitive. The main discussion in this <br>
article is excellent. The distinctions it makes are real. Only the offhand, empiricist way of distinguishing percep-<br>
tion from cognition (or conception) is objectionable. Other articles guided by the empiricist model make <br>
unqualified appeals to abstraction to motivate counting a representation non-perceptual and cognitive are: <br>
