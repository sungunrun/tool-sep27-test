Perceptual Attribution of Relations 177</div>
<br><br>
One perceives instances of properties and kinds. One perceives an instance of yellow <br>
in perceiving a banana, or a sulphurous gas, or a yellow flower. One perceives instances <br>
of bodies and instances of explosions—bodies and explosions. Similarly, for instances <br>
of shapes.<br>
<br>
However, I think that individuals do not perceive instances of the relations <i>to the left of</i> <br>
or <i>larger than</i>, or <i>before</i>. Instances of these relations would be particulars. But such par-<br>
ticulars would, I think, lack causal powers that figure in perceptual reference.183 Instances <br>
of distance relations, for example, are simply line-tracks in space. Even if space-time has <br>
causal power, it is not plausible that parts of it stimulate perceptual states in a way relevant <br>
to perceptual psychology.<br>
<br>
A significant type of perceptual attribution of relations is attribution in spatial and tem-<br>
poral frameworks. Perceptual attributives in such frameworks do not betoken anything. <br>
They do not engage in intra-attribute attribution. In perception, they make only cross-<br>
attribute attributions to <i>relata</i> that figure in those relations. For example, perceptual states <br>
attribute spatial relations among perceived bodies. Referential applications apply to the <br>
bodies. Instances of the spatial relations are not perceived and therefore not betokened <br>
or attributed.<br>
<br>
Although individuals do not perceive relation instances, perceptual states attribute <br>
relation-types. The perceptual states are stimulated by and refer to the <i>relata</i>. For example, <br>
individuals do not perceive instances of the <i>next-to</i> relation. If perception attributes rela-<br>
tion instances, it is only because the instances are carried along in the attribution of the <br>
relation-type. The instances are not perceived. Individuals attribute relations like <i>next-to</i> <br>
to perceived instances of non-relational types (such as instances of <i>body</i>) that are the <i>relata</i> <br>
of the relation.<br>
<br>
Individuals do not always perceive all the <i>relata</i> when in perception they attribute <br>
relations accurately. In perceptual attributions of location with respect to the perceiver, <br>
individuals do not perceive instances of the specific location (distance and direction). <br>
What figures in causing the perceptual state is some particular entity in the location. In <br>
such cases, one perceives only one of the <i>relata</i>, the particular that occupies the relevant <br>
location. One does not perceive oneself or the position on one’s body marked by indexical, <br>
referential application of an egocentric index ego-here. So one does not attribute the <br>
spatial relation-type by <i>perceiving</i> both <i>relata</i>. There are, however, referential applica-<br>
tions to each of the <i>relata</i>. One application is indexical—a perceptual application of a <br>
framework. It is an application of an anchoring index, not a referential application to <br>
something  perceived. See Chapter 8 for further discussion of indexical schematic <br>
constituents.<br>
<br>
Temporal relations comprise another case in which a <i>relatum</i> of a perceptually at tri-<br>
buted relational type is not perceived. Some internal clocks that ground representation of <br>
temporal relations derive from endogenous bodily rhythms. I believe that body clocks <br>
become representations, as opposed to non-perceptual information registrations, only <br>
when they are co-opted by perception. The clocks’ temporal beat precedes perception, and <br><br>

<b>Cont FN</b>183 This point may have been what Kant had in mind when he wrote that we do not perceive time by itself (<i>für <br>
sich</i>): Kant, <i>Critique of Pure Reason</i>, A181/B225. Nothing large in my view hinges on whether there are instances <br>
of such spatial and temporal relations. It seems to me, however, that there are lines in space or space-time that are <br>
such instances.</div>
