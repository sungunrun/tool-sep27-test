Framework 375</div>
<br><br>
The first point concerns acuity. Mammalian vision is by far most acute in the foveated <br>
area of a scene. The optical nature of the cornea and lens and the anatomical structure of <br>
the retina render sharp focus impossible outside the central area of the direction of the <br>
eyes. In humans, this area makes up two or three degrees of the visual field. One degree is <br>
roughly the width of one’s thumbnail held at arm’s length. Outside this area, resolution <br>
grades off precipitously. Out to about 15 degrees from the foveal area, where resolution <br>
stabilizes, resolution drops by about fifty percent for every 2½ degrees distance from <br>
the center.<br>
<br>
Many visual processes that produce representation of physical attributes are carried out <br>
even in low-resolution areas of the visual field. For example, determination of depth from <br>
disparity does not require high resolution information. So one should strictly distinguish <br>
low acuity from lack of objective representation of physical attributes. A full account of <br>
perceptual representational content should distinguish between great detail in the repre-<br>
sentational contents near the center of the visual field and less detail out from the center, <br>
with quite a lot of indistinctness in the peripheral areas. (I will not try to deal with this <br>
important issue.) For example, peripheral color discriminations are very poor, almost <br>
gone. By contrast, movement representation and some shape and depth representation <br>
remain intact with, again, much less precision and detail than in foveal areas.<br>
<br>
A second preliminary point is a reminder that perception can be unconscious as well as <br>
conscious. Although conscious perception can be formed under very brief exposures,394 it <br>
is not securely known when in the processing sequence consciousness emerges. Some of <br>
what I say depends on a distinction between conscious <i>memories</i> of perceptions that retain <br>
perceptual representations and unconscious memories that do so.<br>
<br>
A third preliminary point concerns relations between visual perception and visual <br>
memory. Whereas relatively extensive perception of a scene on short exposure is con-<br>
scious, much of this richness is frequently not retained in memory in a form that allows <br>
report about it on demand. Much of the richness can be shown to be retained uncon-<br>
sciously in memory. Some of the experiments that I discuss show that quite a lot of rich-<br>
ness of perceptual representation is lost to <i>easy conscious access</i> to a memory shortly after <br>
exposure. This point must be understood in the context of a complex memory system that <br>
can be probed by other means than simply by asking an individual what he or she remem-<br>
bers. So although certain experiments have seemed to suggest that individuals perceive <br>
and remember very little on any given short exposure, these experiments must be set in a <br>
wider experimental context. Lacking easy access to consciousness in perceptual memory is <br>
not the same as lacking any perceptual memory at all, much less having lacked perception <br>
(conscious or unconscious) in the first place. (See Chapter 16.)<br>
<br>
A fourth preliminary point is that the perceptual representational content formed in <br>
the first milliseconds of processing has many sketch-like features. It is known that low-<br>
frequency spatial information tends to be computed faster than high-frequency spatial <br>
information. Global sketch-like representations are formed micro-seconds before more <br>
detailed representations. As explained in Chapter 4, the sections Representational <br>
Dependence Hierarchies in Perception and Taxonomic Hierarchies in <br>
Perception, a representation of a 3-D volume shape <i>having a connected outer boundary</i> <br>
or <i>being an animal-body-shape</i> is commonly computed before a representation of the most <br><br>
