Betokening and Four Types of Perceptual Attribution 173</div>

functions are fallible. This fallibility holds not only for perception, but for perceptual-level <br>
representational structures, like perceptual memory. It also holds for perceptual belief.<br>
<br>
Any referential application that functions to refer to a perceived particular can fail to <br>
refer. Again, the sensors could be stimulated artificially to generate a perceptual state that <br>
functions to represent perceived particulars, but fails to do so. Natural referential illusions <br>
are also possible. These occur when environmental conditions conspire to cause sensory <br>
registration that is sufficiently similar to the registration that normally causes successful <br>
perceptual reference.<br>
<br>
Although rare, indication of an attribution type can fail if there is no attribute to indi-<br>
cate. Escher-like shape arrangements are impossible. Complex perceptual indication that <br>
represents according to such impossible arrangements fails to secure a <i>representatum</i>.<br>
<br>
An attributive’s functioning to betoken an attribute-instance can fail, if the referential <br>
application associated with that attributive fails to secure a perceived referent, or if the <br>
referent that it secures is not an instance of an attribute-type indicated by the betokening <br>
attributive. A perceptual state could be a referential illusion as of a shape. Or a perceptual <br>
state could indicate the attribute-type <i>cubical</i> and attribute it to a body; but the perceived <br>
shape could be an instance of <i>cylindrical</i>, not an instance of <i>cubical</i>. The referential appli-<br>
cation associated with cubical refers to an instance of cylindricality. Then the attribute <br>
cubical fails to betoken anything. In either case—referential failure or failure of intra-<br>
attribute attribution—, the cross-attribute attribution by cubical (to the perceived body) <br>
would fail. The perceiver would perceive the body and the instance of <i>cylindrical</i>, while <br>
mis-attributing the attribute <i>cubical</i> to the body and to that shape-instance.<br>
<br>
Is the instance of cylindricality somehow attributed to the body? I think so. It is not <br>
attributed by the attributive cubical, which does not succeed in betokening it, or otherwise <br>
connecting with it representationally. I take it, by (AA2) from Chapter 5, that the percep-<br>
tual referential application that succeeds in referring to the instance of <i>cylindrical</i> is guided <br>
by at least one perceptual attributive for shape, other than cylindrical and cubical, that is <br>
accurate of that instance. The seen instance of <i>cylindrical</i> is also instantiates more generic <br>
shape-types than <i>cylindrical</i> and <i>cubical</i>. The perceptual system characterizes it by one or <br>
more attributives for more generic shape-types, at least an attributive for <i>shape</i>. The seen <br>
instance of <i>cylindrical</i> is attributed to the body, but not attributed as an instance of <i>cylin-<br>
drical</i>, only as an instance of a more generic shape. The more generic attributive’s mode of <br>
presentation does, however, depend on the attributive for <i>cubical</i>: that is how <i>shape</i> looks <br>
on the occasion. An attributive for <i>shape</i> suffices to distinguish the instance from particu-<br>
lars in the environment, including others in the causal chain that begins with the instance <br>
of <i>cylindrical</i> and culminates in causing the perceptual state.<br>
<br>
Any perceptual attribution can fail if there is a failure of relevant referential application, <br>
or if the attribution of an indicated attribute or betokened attribute-instance is not ac cur-<br>
ate of a relevant, perceived particular.<br>
<br>
I summarize these types of failure, often referencing our standard example.<br>
<br>
<i>Cross-attribute attribution</i> of an attribute-<i>type</i> fails:<br><br>
 (1) if the relevant attributive does not indicate an attribute-type (the Escher-type case); <br>
<br>
[hence no attribute-type is attributed by the relevant attributive, although the at tribu-<br>
<br>
tive functions on an occasion of attributive application to make an attribution];</div>
