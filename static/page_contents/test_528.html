528 Perceptual-Level Conation and Action</div>
<br><br>
I qualified the sort of practical rationality presaged in relatively primitive actional sys-<br>
tems as means–end rationality. In the relatively primitive actional systems of non-human <br>
animals and human infants, actional states are mostly reflections of basic animal functions <br>
inherited by each member of the species. They mostly serve eating, mating, navigating, and <br>
so on. Bayesian accounts of even mature, human, relatively primitive action simply take <br>
the conative target-setting states as given. Motor commands are then produced according <br>
to cost-benefit weightings that are applicable relative to the target-setting state. However, a <br>
large part of human practical rationality involves evaluations of conative states themselves. <br>
Bayesian principles for means–end rationality do not capture reasoning about whether <br>
conative states are themselves practically rational. Other considerations besides cost–<br>
bene fit enter into fuller uses of practical reason.<br>
<br>
Still, I think it valuable to see roots of an important aspect of practical rationality <br>
embedded in operating principles that govern relatively primitive action. Psychologies <br>
with conceptual-propositional capacities need not acquire new principles for manipulat-<br>
ing their resources to become means–end practically rational, at least at generic levels of <br>
operation. Bayesian principles for relatively primitive action can just take on propositional <br>
states as new units for processing. At the propositional level, individuals have more con-<br>
trol in setting and evaluating targets. But since the simplest propositional states involve <br>
conceptualizations of perceptual states, the first carry-over for Bayesian principles from <br>
the perceptual to the propositional level is not structurally complicated.<br>
<br>
Recall from Chapter 6, the section Perceptual Contents, Propositions, and <br>
Noun Phrases, that a conceptualization of a perceptual attributive makes essential use <br>
of the mode of presentation of the perceptual attributive that it conceptualizes, and func-<br>
tions to indicate and attribute the same attribute that the perceptual attributive does. <br>
Conceptualizations differ from the perceptual attributives that they conceptualize in that <br>
they function constitutively in a network of propositional competencies.725 Although <br>
these matters must be investigated empirically, it is reasonable to conjecture that process-<br>
ing propositional, conceptualized analogs of perceptual-level representational states track <br>
many of the perceptual-level states’ processing characteristics.<br>
<br>
The second philosophical issue concerns how reflecting on relatively primitive actional <br>
systems can shed light on action <i>per se</i>. I said at this chapter’s outset that accounts of the <br>
nature of action in terms of cognitive conative states miss the mark. Some action is not <br>
psychologically guided at all. Some animal action is guided only by perception, and <br>
perception-level conative states. Some animals engage in this relatively primitive action, <br>
and lack supra-perceptual-level states. Even humans who have propositional-level inten-<br>
tions engage in such relatively primitive action.<br>
<br>
What roles do propositional-level intentions have in relatively primitive action? Roles <br>
vary. Often, an initial conative state is a propositional-level intention. A perceptual-level <br>
target-setting state may be caused by understanding an experimenter’s instructions. The <br>
subject forms an intention that then causes a perceptual-level conative state. Reaches, <br>
ducks, or eye movements that are initiated on the spur of the moment and not part of <br>
a plan seem often not to be initiated by propositional-level intentions. There is nothing in <br>
the computational psychology of human action that <i>requires</i> that the initial conative state, <br><br>
