312 The Iconic Nature of Perception</div>

general view of imagery. The evidence is naturally explained if perceptual imagery is taken <br>
to have the geometrical or topological iconic format of perception.328<br>
<br>
Similar evidence supports the widespread view that some aspects of the iconic form <br>
of visual perceptual representation are retained in visual working memory and visual <br>
anticipation.329 There is also evidence that iconic form remains in visual perceptual <br>
long-term memory.330 Retention often comes with reduced richness, in something like <br>
the way sketches are less rich than realist paintings. In long-term memory, especially in <br>
beings with linguistic capacities, there are surely both iconic and non-iconic types of <br>
representation.<br>
<br>
The fact that perception, perceptual memory, perceptual anticipation, and imagery all <br>
share the format and much of the content of visual perception helps suggest, what I will <br>
argue in Part IV, that they operate at the same representational level in a single perceptual-<br>
level system.<br><br>

<b>Temporal, Qualitative, and Packaging Iconic Aspects of Visual Perception<br><br>
</div>
</b>Spatial representation is most refined and complex in vision and touch. Temporal repre-<br>
sentation is most refined in vision and hearing. All three of these systems, and the pro-<br>
prio cep tive system, are iconic in temporal representation as well as spatial representation.<br>
<br>
The iconic nature of temporal perceptual representation is even more obvious than that <br>
of spatial representation. Perceptual states are extended in time. Attributional applications <br>
(hence contents) can be temporally extended. Natural correlations between temporal <br>
 relations in vision and in what is perceived render temporal perceptual attributions in <br>
vision iconic.<br>
<br>
For example, a temporally extended perception may have a sequence of referential <br>
applications that apply attributives to different events that occur sequentially. The tem-<br>
poral order of the referential applications matches the temporal sequence of events. <br>
Temporal order is a natural property. Mapping between perception and represented events <br><br>

<b>Cont FN</b>328 See also Shepard and Cooper, <i>Mental Images and Their Transformations</i> and Kosslyn, <i>Image and Mind</i>. The <br>
view that imagery is iconic and non-propositional is disputed in Z. Pylyshyn, ‘Return of the Mental Image: Are <br>
There Pictures in the Brain?’, <i>Trends in Cognitive Sciences</i> 7 (2003), 113–118; Pylyshyn, <i>Seeing and Visualizing: It’s <br>
Not What You Think</i>. I believe that Pylyshyn’s criticism of some of the proposed neural evidence for an iconic <br>
view of mental imagery is correct. However, I think that the most natural explanation of psychophysical evidence <br>
is that the formats or structures of the representational content of many instances of perceptual imagery, pro-<br>
duced either in short-term memory or endogenously produced on demand, share iconic structure with percep-<br>
tions. Such imagery is typically less rich and differs from perceptual representation in other ways. I do not go <br>
into the issues in depth. Even Pylyshyn does not dispute the standard view that perceptual representational con-<br>
tent itself is iconic. I think it fair to say that the mainstream in the science of visual imagery and of relations <br>
between perception and imagery has not followed Pylyshyn. Further evidence for relations between visual per-<br>
ceptual imagery and visual perception: L. Cooper and R. Shepard, ‘Chronometric Studies of the Rotation of <br>
