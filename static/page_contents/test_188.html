188  Form and Semantics of Perceptual Contents</div>
<br><br>
Our visual abilities both to categorize edges and surfaces and to relate them to other <br>
specific entities that they are seen as edges <i>of</i> and surfaces <i>of</i> suggests postulation of pairs <br>
of nominal and relational attributives: edge and edge-of, surface and surface of.<br>
<br>
Vision can pick out instances of <i>cubical</i>. It can characterize them in intra-attribute attri-<br>
butions. It can also attribute the instances and the attribute <i>cubical</i> to instances of other <br>
attributes in cross-attribute attribution. The question which instance of <i>cubical</i> a body is <br>
seen to have does not arise. There can be only one instance of <i>cubical</i> in the whole body. <br>
Pressure for a relational attribution is absent.<br>
<br>
Color attributives may differ from shape attributives in that a given color-instance can <br>
be present in different perceptually characterized entities. The same color-instance can be <br>
seen as being in a body and also in the body’s overall surface.191<br>
<br>
The visual system does not attribute many-one relations between shape or color-<br>
instances, on one hand, and instances of entities that they are shapes or colors of, on <br>
the other.<br>
<br>
Assume that an individual attends to the shape of a body, not the body that it is a shape <br>
of. Let us compare this case to the case discussed earlier, in which the system focuses on <br>
the surface of a body, not the body that it is a surface of. To repeat an abbreviated form of <br>
the latter case:<br><br>
(that x1)[(that x2)(body(i)(x2), surface-of(c)(x1, x2), surface(i)(x1))].<br><br>
The form for the case in which the shape is categorized and attended to is:<br><br>
(that x1)[(that x2)(body(i)(x2), cubical(c)(x2), cubical(i)(x1))].<br><br>
There is only one instance of <i>cubical</i> in the whole body. There is no occasion for a visual <br>
system to <i>represent</i> there being more. So the question of which instance characterizes the <br>
body does not arise. So there is no need for a relational cubical attributive.<br>
<br>
Although the point about shape attributives is partly grounded in ontology, it depends <br>
also on a conjecture about perceptual competence. Sometimes perceptual capacities do <br>
not line up with ontology. I conjecture, however, that not only is it ontologically im pos-<br>
sible for there to be two instances of a given shape for a whole single body at a given time, <br>
but also that the visual system cannot represent there being two. The system could prod-<br>
uce a double image of shape on what is perceived to be a single body. I doubt, however, <br>
that the case is best construed as the visual system’s presenting the same body as having <br>
two instances of the shape in the body.<br>
<br>
Let us shift from discussion of the form of shape, surface, and edge attributives, to the <br>
attributive body. Referential applications governing body are usually scope-dominant. For <br>
us, dealing with bodies is commonly most important, ecologically, for survival. In certain <br>
contexts, as noted, they can be less psychologically central, for attention, action, or mem-<br>
ory than surface attributives, or shape attributives, or color attributives, or even edge <br>
attributives. Does body differ from the other types of attributive in some more funda-<br>
mental way?<br><br>

<b>FOOTNOTES</b><br>
<b>Cont FN</b>191 In actual fact, analogous points do apply for whole body-shapes. A given shape-instance can be both in a <br>
statue and in the rock-body of which the statue is made, where the statue and rock-body are not identical.</div>
