perceptual constancies vs other invariances 67</div>
<br><br>
biological functions in enabling an individual to interact successfully with the environ-<br>
ment. For example, the initial neural registrations of light arrays are simply not individu-<br>
ated in terms of visual referents. They are not explained as elements in patterns that <br>
involve veridical or illusory representations as of environmental features that are perceived <br>
or misperceived.<br>
<br>
Here is an example of a fairly common avowal, in the science, of the distinction:<br><br>
The Rfs [Receptive Fields] of V1 neurons are well described as spatially localized filters, <br>
<br>
jointly tuned for orientation and spatial frequency. The “lines” or “edges” that may stimu-<br>
<br>
late these cells do so not because they form the contours of surfaces or objects in any <br>
<br>
perceptual context. Rather, they do so merely because the cells are tuned for the specific <br>
<br>
two-dimensional spatial frequency content of these stimuli, regardless of their perceptual <br>
<br>
context. The tuning characteristics of V1 RFs for color and binocular disparity are like-<br>
<br>
wise well described as simple filters that have no direct connection to the perceptual <br>
<br>
interpretation of distal world structure.58<br><br>
I think that causal-computational explanation in science specifies sensory states in <br>
terms of their representational content and accuracy conditions when and only when sen-<br>
sory states are constituents in perceptual constancies. Non-perceptual sensory states are <br>
caused by environmental features with which they co-vary. They have biological functions <br>
to co-vary with such features. They <i>informationally register</i> such features. If they are not <br>
constituents in perceptual constancies, causal scientific explanations of their formation do <br>
not specify them via a representational content. Their relations to the environmental fea-<br>
tures reside in causal co-variance and biological functions, not in representational content <br>
that both represents the environment and sets accuracy conditions.<br>
<br>
As indicated in Chapter 2, there is a general reason why explanations of an organism’s <br>
states that appeal to success in realizing biological functions are different from (and can-<br>
not do the work of) explanations of an organism’s states in terms of a state’s representa-<br>
tional states with veridicality conditions. Realizing biological functions is a practical <br>
matter—a matter of contributing to survival long enough to reproduce. Being accurate is <br>
not in itself a practical matter. Explanations that appeal to these different notions are cat-<br>
egor ic al ly and apriori different.<br>
<br>
The <i>representata</i> of perception are set through interaction between the objectifying <br>
capacities that reside in the constancies and a pre-perceptual background of interaction <br>
between the perceiver (or the perceiver’s species ancestors and their sensory systems) and <br>
an environment. The relevant pre-perceptual background of interaction is a set of patterns <br>
of sensory interaction, and response to such interaction that meets the needs of individuals.<br>
<br>
Perceptual <i>representata</i> are constitutively determined partly through <i>pre</i>-perceptual <br>
sensory and actional interaction with aspects of the environment. The ecological setting in <br>
which a perceptual system developed helps limit and partly determine the kinds of at trib-<br>
utes that a perceptual system has perceptual attributives for, and hence the kind of particu-<br>
lars that the perceptual system refers to. Perceptual representation operates in a restricted <br>
context of environmental alternatives. What entities a perceptual state refers to—that is, <br><br>
