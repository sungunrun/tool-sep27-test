referent. Perception of a particular occurs only in the event of a perceptual state’s being <br>
caused by the particular. So the noun-like structure is dominated by a context-bound <br>
demonstrative-like schematic determiner, that. The structure is usually dominated by <br>
many such determiners. Huge numbers of particulars are picked out in any normal human <br>
perceptual state. The nominal structure reflects the function of referring aided by charac-<br>
terizing particulars, in that the context-bound determiner, or determiners, scope-<br>
dominate one or more perceptual attributives.<br>
<br>
For now, let us ignore multiple determiners, relational perceptual attributives, and the <br>
sheer multitude of attributives commonly dominated by the determiners. I discuss these <br>
matters in later chapters. Keeping things simple and idealized, the form of perceptual rep-<br>
resentation is<br><br>
 (thatx)F(x). <br><br>
That(x) is the schematic marker of the repeatable competence to engage in perceptual ref-<br>
erence—in perceptually singling out particulars. F is a perceptual attributive that func-<br>
tions to guide the referential competence. An occurrent exercise of this competence, or <br>
occurrent application of this form, is (that x1)F(x1). The subscript marks a referential <br>
application.<br>
<br>
Recall that the form of perceptual representation is simultaneously the form of percep-<br>
tual representational content. Assuming that ‘F’ is filled out with a specific perceptual <br>
attributive, (that x1)F(x1) is a perceptual representational content.<br>
<br>
Recall also that representational contents set veridicality conditions. So (that x1)F(x1), <br>
for a specific attributive F and referential application marked by subscript, sets an ac cur-<br>
acy condition.<br>
<br>
(That x1)F(x1) is accurate if and only if that x1 picks out a particular and F is accurate of <br>
that particular. F is accurate of that particular if and only if F indicates an attribute that the <br>
particular in fact has or instantiates. Thus (that x1)body(x1) is accurate if and only if that x1 <br>
picks out a particular body. That x1 succeeds in picking out a body if and only if the body is <br>
relevantly perceived via the perceptual state. In such a case, the body causes the perceptual <br>
state’s occurrent referential application that x1. If multiple bodies are perceived, each body <br>
must cause a different occurrent aspect of the perceptual state, including a different refer-<br>
ential application. If (that x1)body(x1) is accurate, the perceptual state constitutes a percep-<br>
tion of a body as a body. Perception of the body is perceptually picking out, or perceptually <br>
referring to, the body. Perceiving the body <i>as</i> a body is attributing the perceptual attribu-<br>
tive body to the perceived particular. In an accurate perception, the attributive body is <br>
accurate of the perceived particular; and the attribution to (characterization of) the body <br>
as a body is accurate.<br><br>

<b>Perception as Objectification<br><br>
</div>
</b>I now turn to the last of the key notions in the rough explication of what perception is. <br>
Perception is <i>objective</i>. It is objective in two ways. First, it is capable of being veridical <br>
of a subject matter that it is either mind-independent or at least constitutively </div>
