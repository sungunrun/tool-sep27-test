and the rise of representational psychology. Discussion of them and subsequent kindred <br>
experiments has occupied a large place in the psychological literature.<br>
<br>
Many controversies over mental imagery have been settled empirically. I think it no <br>
longer reasonable to doubt that imagery occurs in mental life, or that imagery discussed in <br>
empirical work has an iconic format derivative from perception.1026 No one thinks that <br>
imagery must always be consciously pictorial. No one thinks that images, like pictures, are <br>
internally “looked at”.1027<br>
<br>
Although the format and representational content of imagery derive from perception, <br>
imagining and perception are dissociable. Some brain-damaged patients who cannot gen-<br>
erate images can respond to perception. Some who can generate images have serious per-<br>
ceptual deficits. There is evidence that the capacity for imagining is carried out by joint <br>
operation of several processes.1028 Of course, imagining can occur without current input. <br>
Some uses of visual imaging do not engage lower visual areas (such as V1). Some do. One <br>
can perceive without using memory. Perceptual imagining requires some reliance on <br>
remembered perceptual contents.1029<br>
<br>
However, there is evidence that imagining and perception share some of the same brain <br>
areas, sometimes specialized to the specific entities that are imagined or perceived. For <br>
example, both perception and imagining of faces are supported in the fusiform face area. <br>
Both perception and imagining of places, or scene-types, are supported in the hippocam-<br>
pal complex.1030<br>
<br>
Not all visual imagery is driven by manipulating visual-perceptual capacities. Some <br>
solutions to mental rotation problems may be driven by imagining what one would see if <br>
one rotated the object, as contrasted with what one would see if the object rotated via <br>
some outside force. In some responses to mental-rotation-type experiments, subjects’ sen-<br>
sorimotor systems are strongly activated. In other cases, not.1031 I focus on the latter type. <br>
What I have to say about imagery’s relation to perception applies to the former type, with <br>
qualifications.<br>
<br>
A key result in the initial Shepard and Metzler experiments and in subsequent ex peri-<br>
ments of the same type is that the time it takes subjects to answer a question about whether <br>
two images (2-D or 3-D) that are rotated (either in a plane or in depth) have the same <br>
shape is proportional to the degree of angle of rotation between the figures.1032<br><br>
