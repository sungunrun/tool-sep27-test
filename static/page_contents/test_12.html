perceptual psychology. Some of these capacities produce intuitively familiar features of <br>
conscious perception. But many others produce aspects—especially categorizing aspects—<br>
of perception that depend on specific species-needs or individual-needs and on statistical <br>
patterns in the environment that perceptual systems have capitalized upon. Some of these <br>
do not line up with intuitive senses of image-similarity. In focusing on <i>capacities</i> and <i>use</i> <br>
not introspection, the account also finds perception to engage in levels of abstraction that <br>
can easily seem not to be capable of being represented directly by an image. Yet, I believe <br>
that in being iconic, visual perception is always grounded in image-like representation. <br>
Developing this combination of ideas is a central part of this initiative in the book.<br>
<br>
I reject the empiricist way of distinguishing perception and thought (or cognition, or <br>
conception)—which cites differences in levels of abstraction. Both perception and prop os-<br>
ition al thought occur at highly concrete and highly abstract levels. Thought can rely on <br>
perception in its modes of presentation, and be every bit as concrete and detailed as per-<br>
ception can be. Conversely, perceptual representation extends from very concrete and <br>
finely discriminated to very generic groupings. Thoughts share various levels of concre-<br>
tion and abstraction with perceptions by constitutively relying, partly, on perception for <br>
representing. Of course, some thoughts are abstract in ways that no perceptions are. <br>
Thoughts can be about unobservables. Some thoughts are amodal, independent of a sen-<br>
sory modality. Some represent logical functions or numbers that lack instances in space or <br>
time. But since perceptions can be very abstract and thought can be very concrete, the <br>
empiricist way of distinguishing them is misdirected.<br>
<br>
The difference between perception and thought resides not in what can be intuitively <br>
introspected in an image. It resides in different forms, functions, uses, and capacities <br>
(or competencies). Although thought shares perception’s basic representational  capacities—<br>
specifically reference and attribution—, it constitutively involves further capacities, func-<br>
tions, and forms not present in perception. Use and competence ground constitutive <br>
differences between perception and thought, not image-like format and not (primarily) <br>
levels of concreteness or abstraction.<br>
<br>
These themes run throughout the book. They emerge first in Chapter 2, Perception as <br>
Objectification. They become much more prominent in Chapter 4, Taxonomic Hierarchies <br>
in Perception. They run strongly through Chapters 8–10 and 12. They mark all discussions <br>
of categorization. They culminate in the last two sections of Chapter 19.<br>
<br>
Replacing the traditional empiricist introspective approach to perception aids the fifth <br>
main aim of the book: developing notions of <i>perceptual system</i> and <i>perceptual-motor sys-<br>
tem</i>. This aim occupies Chapter 19. The aim is guided by the attempt to understand differ-<br>
ences between perceptual-level and supra-perceptual-level capacities, which has as <br>
background Chapters 13–18. I think that the deepest divide in the mind is between <br>
perceptual-level states and propositional-level states. Otherwise put, the divide is between <br>
the level of perception and the level of propositional reasoning or thought. I explore pos-<br>
sible non-propositional, supra-perceptual capacities. But the key target is understanding <br>
the large perceptual and perceptual-motor systems. These systems mark, I think, the terri-<br>
tory of lower representational mind.<br>
<br>
What immediately follows is an unnuanced forecast of some ideas to be developed <br>
about relations between perception and conception. More detailed discussion of exactly <br>
how I understand relations between higher-level representational resources and percep-<br>
tion, or perceptual-level ones, occupies Part IV, especially Chapter 19.</div>
