Beck uses my work, often to good effect, in explaining his views. He uses his notion of <br>
stimulus dependence to make interesting proposals about differences between referen-<br>
tial failures that derive from perception and referential failures that derive from <br>
imagining.<br>
<br>
There are, however, further difficulties for taking temporal removal from present prox-<br>
imal stimulation as the main basis for understanding cognition. Consider Beck’s attempt <br>
to show that perceptually informed beliefs do not meet his condition for being perceptual. <br>
Beck uses a notion of stimulus dependent demonstrative thoughts.1102 Take a present, <br>
occurrent demonstrative thought, that1 body is red. A prima facie problem that Beck tries <br>
to solve is that perceptually grounded demonstrative thoughts are instances of cognition, <br>
but they ‘have the function of being stimulus-dependent’—that is, being occurrently caus-<br>
ally sustained by present proximal stimulation. This fact seems to contradict (Beck). <br>
Appealing to my account, Beck states that key elements of the demonstrative thought are <br>
its conceptual attributives—in this case bodyc and redc. (The subscript ‘c’ just marks the <br>
attributives as conceptual.) These concepts derive from perceptual attributives, bodyp and <br>
redp that occur in the perceptual state from which the thought derives.<br>
<br>
Beck tries to solve the prima facie problem by claiming that the demonstrative element <br>
(the referential application of that) in the demonstrative thought has the function of being <br>
stimulus dependent, but the attributive elements (bodyc and redc) do not have this func-<br>
tion.1103 By implication, the perceptual attributives (bodyp and redp) do.<br>
<br>
Of course, both perceptual and conceptual attributives have representational functions <br>
(among other functions). Neither type of attributive has a specific function, in all uses or <br>
instances, with respect to the temporal occurrence of proximal stimulation. Temporal <br>
functions of the sort that Beck highlights apply to psychological modalities, like percep-<br>
tion, perceptual memory, or perceptually applied perceptual belief, not to attributives. <br>
Such functions also apply to <i>instances</i> or <i>occurrences</i> of attributives. In their occurrences in <br>
occurrent perceptual beliefs, concepts bodyd4concept and redr7concept function to be sustained <br>
by proximal stimulation. They betoken their instances. These concepts and their percep-<br>
tual counterparts, bodyd4percept and redr7percept, can function to guide reference to particulars <br>
(a particular body; a particular trope of redness). Both pairs can function to be causally <br>
sustained by present proximal stimulation, insofar as they are present in a psy cho logic al <br>
mode that has such a function—for example, they occur respectively in a perception and <br>
in an occurrent perceptual belief. In fact, constitutively, both pairs have such a function in <br>
some occurrences. This is obviously so for the perceptual attributives, but insofar as the <br>
conceptual attributives are capable of occurring in perceptual beliefs, they too constitu-<br>
tively have the function of being sustained by present stimulations in some <br><br>

<b>FOOTNOTES</b><br>
<b>FN</b>1102 In discussing the problem, I use Beck’s notion of demonstrative thought. I do not agree with some aspects <br>
of his construal of this notion. For example, he thinks that one cannot veridically sustain the visually grounded <br>
demonstrative thought that1 book is large if one closes one’s eyes: Beck, ‘Marking the Perception–Cognition <br>
Boundary: The Criterion of Stimulus-Dependence’, section 5. I see not the slightest reason to think that one can-<br>
not continue to think this thought veridically if one closes one’s eyes and holds the thought in memory. <i>De re</i> <br>
referential applications do not lapse; they can be retained in memory.<br>
<b>FN</b>1103 I have always allowed referential applications to be preserved in memory and even across speakers in <br>
discourse. See Burge, ‘Russell’s Problem and Intentional Identity’. In memory, they lack the function of being sus-<br>
tained by current proximal stimulation that Beck specifies. So on his view (see (Beck)), if perceptual referential <br>
applications are allowed to be preservable in memory, perceptual content itself is not perceptual, because such <br>
applications do not <i>necessarily</i> or <i>constitutively</i>  have the function of being sustained by present stimuli, even <br>
though they are, contingently, sustained by present stimuli when they occur in perception.</div>
