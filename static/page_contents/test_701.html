traditional ways of doing vision science.1151 I regard them as challenges only to dubious <br>

</b>Let us consider more closely indirect effects of beliefs and belief-level intentions on per-<br>
ceptual processing through visual perceptual attention. The selection <i>effects</i> of attention, <br>
exogenous and endogenous, are effects in, hence parts of, visual processing. It is well to <br>
distinguish the effects of attention and the initiations of attention—especially endogenous <br>
attention commands. The effects of perceptual attention are selection effects—results <br>
within perceptual processing and perceptual states of biased competition among resources. <br>
They are simply the results of selectivity in visual processing. Sometimes these effects are <br>
caused exogenously by the stimulus. Sometimes initiation of attention effects is <br>
endogenous.<br>
<br>
When attentional selection effects on perception derive from endogenous initiation, <br>
attention initiation may have a content:<br><br>
select: (here-cego x1)(that x2)(F(i)(x), LocL1(c)(x2, x1)).<br><br>
Feature-based attention anticipating rather than operating on current perception can <br>
have the form:<br><br>
select: (that x2)redr1(i)(x).<br><br>
Normally such anticipation involves only schematic representation of particulars, suppos-<br>
ing that there is not yet any causal connection to particulars through future action or <br>
through memory. Impetus to object-based attention during a current perception has the <br>
form illustrated by:<br><br>
select: (that x1)bodyd1(i)(x1).<br><br>

<b>FOOTNOTES</b><br>
<b>FN</b>1151 I have not discussed alleged cases of cognitive penetration that hinge specifically on the linguistic nature <br>
of penetrators. A summary of such cases can be found in Lupyan, ‘Not Even Wrong: The “It’s Just X” Fallacy’. A <br>
larger sampling of relevant literature is as follows: G. Lupyan and M. Spivey, ‘Perceptual Processing is Facilitated <br>
by Ascribing Meaning to Novel Stimuli’, <i>Current Biology</i> 18 (2008), 412–414; A. Landau, L. Aziz-Zadeh, and <br>
R. Ivry, ‘The Influence of Language on Perception: Listening to Sentences about Faces Affects perception of Faces’, <br>
<i>The Journal of Neuroscience</i> 30 (2010), 15254–15261; V. Pelekanos and K. Moutoussis, ‘The Effect of Language on <br>
Visual Contrast Sensitivity’, <i>Perception</i> 40 (2011), 1402–1412; Boutonnet, and Lupyan, ‘Words Jump-Start Vision: <br>
A Label Advantage in Object Recognition’. Landau <i>et</i> <i>al</i>., an impressive piece of work, makes no claims about <br>
cognitive penetrability. For apt discussion of such cases, see Firestone and Scholl, ‘Cognition Does Not Affect <br>
Perception: Evaluating the Evidence for “Top-Down” Effects’, section 4. All cases in these articles involve effects <br>
(on attention, or priming, or anticipatory sets) that occur <i>before</i> the onset of the stimulus. No defender of impen-<br>
etrability has maintained that cognitive effects cannot be put in place—at least indirectly, through attention, <br>
priming, and setting of priors—before a perceptual stimulus occurs. However, I think it likely that there are cases <br>
in which effects of language are ongoing—during perceptual processing. Even so, all cases of causal influence on <br>
non-linguistic visual processing appear to fit the pattern that I have been discussing.<br>
