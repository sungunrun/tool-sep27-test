though the blind can certainly have conceptual attributives as of red. Similarly, for shape <br>
concepts whose applications are mathematically, not perceptually, based.<br>
<br>
Another consideration that weighs against counting an attributive perceptual concerns <br>
attributives for certain natural kinds. As discussed in Chapter 4, the section Two <br>
Methodological Points About Natural-Kind and Functional <br>
Attributives, having chemical and biological natural-kind attributives requires sensi-<br>
tivity to a distinction between perceivable properties and underlying, non-perceivable <br>
properties that may determine the kind. A major advance in young children is recognition <br>
that some words/concepts are not securely applicable on the basis of perceptual exposure, <br>
together with perceptual anticipations, alone. The possibility that two things may look the <br>
same but be of different kinds is recognized by 3–4 years of age in human children. <br>
Sensitivity to this possibility grounds having relevant natural kind concepts—concepts <br>
that apply to entities on the basis of the entities’ natures, as contrasted with the entities’ <br>
perceivable properties. These attributives can be eliminated as candidates for being per-<br>
ceptual attributives. Perceptual systems can be assumed not to represent attributes whose <br>
distinguishing depends on more than perceptual-level capacities.<br>
<br>
A type of evidence often invoked in scientific work is activation of brain areas that are <br>
known to serve vision during applications of a candidate for inclusion in the perceptual <br>
system. Such evidence can have prima facie force. As relations between areas of neural <br>
activation and psychological function are better understood, this type of evidence will be <br>
increasingly useful.<br>
<br>
Another type of evidence derives from adaptation.556 If subjects are repeatedly shown <br>
clear, paradigmatic instances of a perceivable property—say, a shape or a facial expres-<br>
sion—, then when they are presented with a less paradigmatic or borderline instance of <br>
the property, they are less likely to judge that that instance instantiates the property. For <br>
example, if before adaptation a facial expression is judged about equally to be a fear <br>
expression or an anger expression, and subjects are repeatedly shown clear instances of <br>
anger expressions, then, when they are again shown the first facial expression, they are <br>
more likely to judge it to be a fear expression.<br>
<br>
There is extensive evidence that adaptation has its root in sensory phenomena.557 It <br>
occurs in processing supported by visual brain areas V1–V5, and in the inferior temporal <br>
cortex, IT. In tested cases, applications of amodal conceptual attributives have not shown <br>
adaptation. It is a mistake, however, to think of adaptation as a prima face <i>criterion</i> for a <br>
state’s being perceptual. Adaptation shows that a state is closely connected to a sensory <br>
state. But perceptual applications of an attributive’s exhibiting adaptation is not in itself <br>
reason to conclude that the attributive <i>is</i> perceptual. Conversely, it is not certain that all <br>
perceptual states adapt.558<br><br>

conjectures that some perceptual states—such as perceptions that attribute symmetry—may not adapt. The con-<br>
