254 Attributives, Referential Applications in Constancies</div>
<br><br>
The perception is fully accurate if and only if all referential applications refer to a par-<br>
<br>
ticular; all attributions of attributives are accurate of the particulars that they are <br>
<br>
(at tribu tively) applied to; and all referential applications marked by the same super-<br>
<br>
script (in a given tracking linkage) refer to the same particular.<br><br>
For example, the representational content of the second, tracking perception, dis-<br>
cussed above,<br><br>
(that xa2)bodyd1(i)(xa2)<br><br>
is fully accurate if and only if<br><br>
(that xa2) refers to a particular; bodyd1(i)(xa2) is accurate of the particular that (that <br>
<br>
xa2) refers to; and (that xa1) (from the preceding perception) and (that xa2) refer to the <br>
<br>
same particular.<br><br>
There can be a type of perceptual accuracy in a perceptual state even if it fails to track a <br>
previously perceived particular that it functions to trackâ€”as long as the referential appli-<br>
cations have referents, and attributions of indicated attributes are accurate of those refer-<br>
ents. The second perceptual state has this kind of accuracy if the first two clauses of the <br>
just-stated accuracy condition are met. Both the preceding and the present perception <br>
(which perceives accurately but fails its function to track) might be accurate, taken by <br>
themselves. Since the second perception functions representationally to track the first, <br>
however, there is also a type of inaccuracy in the second perception, if it fails to do so. <br>
Tracking particulars is a basic representational function of perception.</div>
