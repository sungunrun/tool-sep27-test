<b>Perceptual Attention<br><br>
</div>
</b>The relation [between intention and attention] is therefore . . . one not of <br>
<br>
immediate but of mediate control.<br>
<br>
Helmholtz, <i>Handbuch der Physiologischen Optik</i> (author’s translation)<br><br>
I count <i>perceptual attention</i> any attention that occurs in, or has its initial main direct effect <br>
on, perceptual-level states or processing. Perceptual attention contrasts with <i>conceptual <br>
attention</i>. Conceptual attention is any attention that occurs in, or has its main direct effect <br>
on, propositional transactions. Having one’s attention captured by sudden, perceived <br>
movement, or directing one’s attention to red bodies in visual search, is perceptual attention. <br>
Concentration on a mathematical problem while deferring ruminating on an election is <br>
conceptual attention. Attention can also mainly affect sub-representational states. I do not <br>
much discuss either conceptual attention or sub-representational attention. I focus on per-<br>
ceptual attention, specifically the visual kind.<br>
<br>
Perceptual attention can have causal sources outside perceptual processing, indeed, <br>
outside the visual system. It can have conceptual/propositional sources. I think that such <br>
sources operate through perceptual-level initiations of attention, often attention com-<br>
mands. <i>Attention commands</i> are initiations of attention that have representational con-<br>
tent. Attention usually is an effect of task-relevance, some conative orientation. As seen <br>
in Chapter 14, conative states are not all conceptual or propositional. Many are <br>
perceptual-level. Perceptual-level attention commands are part of the perceptual system. <br>
One of the grounds for taking direct initiations of perceptual attention as being <br>
perceptual-level is that conceptual, propositional, and other clearly cognitive influences <br>
on attention are not invoked in computational explanations of visual attention. Such <br>
explanations do not and need not appeal to the extra sophistication and representa-<br>
tional structure involved in  cognitive, paradigmatically conceptual-propositional, states. <br>
They appeal to attention commands, conative states, and memories that use perceptual <br>
attributives. They appeal to no operations more complex or sophisticated than those at <br>
work in perceptual processing.<br>
<br>
Perceptual attention is a natural concomitant of visual perception. Differences in reso-<br>
lution in different parts of the eye and the fact that perceptual systems always serve action <br>
and reaction make a capacity to enhance some sub-part of perception’s representational <br>
capacity evolutionarily inevitable. Basic forms of attention initiation are not more sophis-<br>
ticated than perception. They—like memory, anticipation, and conative states that initiate <br>
motor action—operate at the same representational level that perception does. They are part <br>
of the visual or visuomotor system.</div>
