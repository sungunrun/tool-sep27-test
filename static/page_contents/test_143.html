(AA1a)  In every perceptual-state-instance that functions to pick out more than one par-<br>
<br>
ticular, each occurrent referential application applies an attributive or attributives <br>
<br>
that differ from the attributive or attributives applied by every other referential <br>
<br>
application in the same perceptual state-instance.<br><br>
If the perceptual state functions to pick out more than one instance of <i>blue</i> as parts of an <br>
instance the <i>blue</i>, it represents each part and the whole as an instance of <i>blue</i>. The state <br>
might function to distinguish parts’ spatial relations relative to one another: that blue to <br>
the left of that blue, with respect to ego-here, and by relational part-of attributives.<br>
<br>
(AA1a) does <i>not</i> claim that the differentiating attributives associated with each referen-<br>
tial application must be accurate of the different perceived particulars, or must <i>accurately</i> <br>
differentiate the perceived particulars. In cases of successful perceptual reference to differ-<br>
ent particulars via a perceptual state, the differentiation among different perceived par-<br>
ticulars need not be even partly <i>effected</i> by the attributives. The differentiation is, as always, <br>
a combination of the causal chain, from a perceived particular and an occurrent aspect or <br>
part of the perceptual state (a referential application), and a perceptual attributive. Strictly <br>
speaking, the causal chain that runs from the whole color patch to the perceptual state is a <br>
different chain from the one that runs from any part of the color patch to (an aspect of) <br>
the perceptual state. And each part figures in a different causal chain from any other part. <br>
If different particulars are perceived, but the only accurate attributives apply to all of them, <br>
the different causal chains are the source of differentiation. (AA1a) claims only that per-<br>
ceptual states function to exercise their repeatable competencies, their attributives, in dif-<br>
ferentiating among particulars that are purportedly (or actually) perceived.<br>
<br>
Since (AA1a) is not central to my primary concerns, I do not linger over it. I do, how-<br>
ever, conjecture that it is true, necessary, and apriori, given that perceptual states exist.<br><br>

<b>Support for (AA2)<br><br>
</div>
</b>I turn to (AA2):151<br><br>
(AA2)  In every perceptual state, each occurrent, demonstrative-like, perceptual referential <br>
<br>
application that succeeds in referring to a particular must be associated with appli-<br>
<br>
cation of at least one perceptual attributive that functions to dis crim in ate that par-<br>
<br>
ticular from some other particulars in the environment, and that is <i>accurate of</i> that <br>
<br>
particular. That is, every perception of a particular must involve an application of at <br>
<br>
least one discriminatory perceptual attributive that is ac cur ate of that particular.<br><br>
An opponent of (AA2) holds:<br><br>
(Not-A A2) It is possible for some perceptual referential application to succeed in referring <br>
<br>
to a particular, even though no perceptual attributive associated with that referen-<br>
<br>
tial application is accurate of that particular.<br><br>
