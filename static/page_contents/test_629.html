perceptual processing. Very simple animals with perception, such as insects, clearly <br>
undergo perceptual learning.991<br>
<br>
The point that perceptual learning derives from mechanisms that are perceptual-level <br>
or lower does not rest on thinking of all such mechanisms as classical Pavlovian or operant-<br>
conditioning mechanisms, though some are. Some of the mechanisms incorporate repre-<br>
sentation of spatial relations, in addition to simple associations.<br>
<br>
A further reason to think that perceptual learning—hence both categorizations and <br>
memory that serves and preserves perceptual learning—is perceptual-level is that it has a <br>
close link to perceptual constancies. To illustrate the point, I discuss an experiment on <br>
perceptual learning that focused on size constancy. A central mechanism that contributes <br>
to size constancy is a computation that takes retinal size and distance information as <br>
inputs and yields an environmental size as output. Subjects were shown displays and asked <br>
to respond ‘yes’ or ‘no’ depending on whether a pair of displays were instances of an <br>
unnamed attribute X. The subjects’ task was to discover what information determines hav-<br>
ing attribute X, based on feedback after each response.<br>
<br>
A pair of rectangles is presented on each trial. On half the trials, the rectangles have the <br>
same size. The correct answer is ‘yes’ if and only if the two presented rectangles are same-<br>
sized. Although sizes and other stimulus-values change across trials, subjects normally use <br>
feedback gradually to discover this regularity and classify accurately.<br>
<br>
If the two rectangles are presented at the same distance and orientation, the same size <br>
attribute could be learned in either of two ways. The subject might learn that pairs of <br>
rect angles have either equal environmental size or equal retinal-image size—since rec-<br>
tangles’ size and the size of the retinal projections of the rectangles would be the same <br>
(or different) in all the same cases. In a separate condition, stereoscopic depth differ-<br>
ences are presented between the two rectangles. Then pairs can have same retinal sizes <br>
but different perceived distances. Differences in perceived distance affect rectangles’ <br>
perceived sizes, but can be presented in ways that the differences do not affect the rec-<br>
tangles’ projected retinal sizes. When the two candidate ways of learning are disassoci-<br>
ated in this way, ex peri ments showed that shape size, <i>not</i> projected retinal-image size, is <br>
learned. In fact, it seems that, in such cases, sameness of projected retinal-image size <br>
cannot be learned. The learning follows the <i>representata</i> of perceptual constancies. <br>
Similar experiments were run on lightness constancy and direction of motion con-<br>
stancy—with similar results.992<br>
<br>
These experiments suggest a pattern of perceptual learning along the following lines:<br><br>

Cognition, and Expertise’. Garrigan and Kellman assume that the experiments test perceptual learning. The fact <br>
that the subjects were queried in language leaves open the possibility that the learning was linguistically medi-<br>
ated. I think the authors’ view overwhelmingly plausible. Any cognitive learning that occurs seems grounded on <br>
perceptual learning. Running similar experiments on non-linguistic animals or pre-linguistic children could <br>
support the view. As far as I know, the experiments have not been run. I think, however, that the outcome of such <br>
experiments is predictable.</div>
