Two Changes in Scientific Understanding of Perception-Formation 411</div>

thought of as higher-up in the visual-processing hierarchy—what is known as <i>recurrent <br>
processing</i>. As soon as a retinal signal reaches a later area, it initiates feedback to earlier <br>
areas. There is input from capacities that are not strictly perceptual—such as attention, <br>
anticipation, memory, and so on—at various stages of processing.<br>
<br>
A common error by advocates of this large shift of perspective is to caricature the <br>
 “trad ition al” picture that prevailed from the 1970s to the early 1990s. It has been claimed <br>
that input from non-visual modalities into early stages of visual processing was not recog-<br>
nized. This claim is simply not true. Effects of proprioception, including efferent copy, on <br>
visual perception have long been emphasized in the science. Depth perception has long <br>
been known to use extra-retinal cues from the directions in which the eyes point—cues <br>
from sensors in the eye muscles. Intermodal phenomena such as the McGurk effect, in <br>
which auditory perception affects visual perception, were studied long before the shift. It <br>
has been claimed that effects of attention or learning on early visual processing were <br>
ignored. Again, such claims false. Pre-cueing, which usually involves direction of attention <br>
and is often taken to exhibit a type of perceptual learning, has long been a standard topic. <br>
Perceptual settings have long been known to result from both innate and learned factors.<br>
<br>
What is different is discovery of the sheer volume of multi-directional processing and <br>
the fact that multi-directionality occurs at all stages <i>within</i> the visual system, even after <br>
a visual stimulus occurs. Also different is discovery of the large effects of input from <br>
 not-strictly perceptual sources—such as endogenous attention—at various stages of visual <br>
processing.<br>
<br>
Both psychophysics and neuro-science contributed to the shift in perspective. Neuro-<br>
science provided much of the evidence. I discuss some of this evidence. I remark first on <br>
its status. The psychophysics of vision aims to state laws or law-like principles by which <br>
representations of specific environmental attributes and particulars are formed, and to <br>
state conditions under which such representations are veridical or non-veridical. The <br>
neuro-science of vision focuses on neural pathways and laws governing the formation of <br>
neural states. It also centers on functions of such states in grounding vision. Psychophysics <br>
and neuro-science have different explanatory foci.<br>
<br>
It is, of course, philosophically controversial how neural states relate to perceptual <br>
states. It is not controversial whether psychophysics and neuro-science explain evidence <br>
in different terms. The aim of psychophysics is the fundamental aim of the psychology of <br>
vision. Neuro-science contributes. Explanations that it provides are, so far, not <i>psy cho-<br>
logic al ly</i> deep, as the best current psychophysical explanations are. Neuro-scientific <br>
ex plan ations do not provide principles for how specific visual representations about the <br>
environment are formed. Neuro-science can give rigorous and deep explanations of the <br>
occurrence, structure, and function of neural states in neural terms. Such explanations are <br>
not themselves deep explanations of psychological processes.<br>
<br>
I see much neuro-science of vision as standing, explanatorily, to the psychology of <br>
vision (to psychophysics) roughly as geography stands to geo-physics. I do not draw an <br>
ontological analogy here, just an analogy regarding types and levels of explanation. <br>
Inasmuch as neuro-science has contributed to psychophysics, it largely maps functional <br>
territory and furthers understanding of early, pre-perceptual coding. Discovery that cer-<br>
tain brain areas correlate with exercise of certain functions is important science, but not <br>
deep science. It is a crucial preliminary that constrains and guides psychological ex plan-<br>
ation. It does not explain psychological processes in psychological terms. It does not </div>
