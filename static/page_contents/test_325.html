Being iconic is not essentially representational, though it does essentially depend on use <br>
of information.<br>
<br>
Another misconception is to think that being an iconic representation, or representa-<br>
tional content, requires that every representational constituent be iconic. Obviously non-<br>
iconic words can be used as labels in maps. Referential applications are constituents in <br>
iconic representational content and contributors to semantical structure. An occurrent <br>
referential application is not <i>in itself</i> even the kind of thing that could be iconic. It is not <br>
“discursive” either. The basic semantical functions—referential application and attribution— <br>
are not in themselves iconic. They do not in themselves map into natural structures in the <br>
represented, natural world. Whatever iconicity referential applications seem to have is <br>
derivative from the attributives that they apply. The natural sciences do not study attribu-<br>
tion. They study instantiation. In itself, attribution (as distinguished from attributives) is <br>
not iconic. All iconic <i>representation</i>, even representation that lacks occurrent referential <br>
applications, contains non-iconic aspects.<br>
<br>
A corollary mistake is that of identifying representational constituents too closely with <br>
parts of a picture, where ‘part’ is understood in a commonsense way, not guided by semanti-<br>
cal reflection. I have criticized versions of this error that take parts of the picture to be repre-<br>
sentational units, when they are not. The Fodor–Kosslyn claim that one can cut a picture any <br>
way one likes embodies this error. Another version of the error is to assume that every repre-<br>
sentational constituent is a part of the picture, in an unqualified, intuitive sense of ‘part’. <br>
Referential applications are representational constituents, but not intuitively parts of a picture.<br>
<br>
Recall some basic points about the relation between parts of <i>sentences</i>  and semantical <br>
constituents. I stipulate that letters and parts of letters are not parts of sentences. Let us <br>
assume, for the sake of illustration, that words or morphemes are basic parts of sentences. <br>
Some parts, so understood, are not representational units. Words embedded in some <br>
 idioms are not semantic constituents of sentences. Conversely, some representational con-<br>
stituents are not morphemes, words, or word combinations. In context-dependent uses of <br>
sentences, representational constituents include occurrent, contextual, referential applica-<br>
tions. These are the referential events that constitute occurrent uses of demonstrative-<br>
governed phrases. No word or symbol, in the language, expresses or stands in for the <br>
occurrent, referential application.<br>
<br>
Word-types like the demonstrative ‘that’ are schemas. Such word-types do not represent, <br>
demonstratively, any given entity. Occurrent use is needed to carry out such representation. <br>
The occurrent event of referential application, not the word itself, is the semantical unit <br>
that is central to referential representation. There is no separate part of the sentence that is <br>
specific to the occurrent event of application. Ultimately, language <i>must</i> rely on applica-<br>
tions that are not themselves terms or parts of sentences. They are not themselves symbols. <br>
They are events of application.<br>
<br>
The same point applies to pictures and perceptual states.352 In a picture, reference to a <br>
particular is effected by an occurrent use. Singular reference to a real particular is effected <br><br>

<b>FOOTNOTES</b><br>
<b>Cont FN</b>352 Linguistically specified allocentric maps can avoid context-dependent referential applications to their <br>
anchors and positions. However, many allocentric maps use ordinary proper names, which involve context-<br>
dependent determiners. See Burge, ‘Reference and Proper Names’. Even non-context-dependent, canonical <br>
names must, in the end, be explained in terms of context-dependent referential applications. Egocentrically <br>
anchored maps all involve referential applications, at least of the applied spatial indexical markers of the “home” <br>
anchor position.</div><div id="PGHEADER">
