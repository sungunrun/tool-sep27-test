right. Given that the motivation is ungrounded, I see no reason in this case to take percep-<br>
tual states as representing intervals.<br>
<br>
Vision science does <i>not</i> take perceptual states to represent intervals in such cases. <br>
Instead, there are probability distributions of perceptual estimations that cluster, more or <br>
less precisely, around a single dominant value. Scalar visual estimates are taken to be fairly <br>
exact, and usually slightly inaccurate.762 The inaccuracy is taken to result from various <br>
factors, including noise and insufficient acuity. Hess and Field comment, ‘Some degree of <br>
inaccuracy will always be expected in a noisy system even when sampled at a sufficiently <br>
high resolution’.763<br>
<br>
Block interprets imprecision in terms of the representation-of-intervals proposal. The <br>
wider the interval, the less precise the perceptual representation. Vision science interprets <br>
precision differently—in terms of how diverse the most common perceptual estimates are <br>
in a given stimulus condition, holding other factors, such as attention, as constant as pos-<br>
sible. Accuracy is distinguished from precision. If perceptual estimates in controlled con-<br>
ditions tend to be very close to one another, the perceptual capacity is precise, whether or <br>
not the estimates cluster around accurate representation. Optimality theorems in vision <br>
science take estimates to be relatively precise—not estimates of intervals. The theorems <br>
investigate whether, and how, such estimates cluster around an accurate representation. <br>
These theorems and the standard conception of precision assume definite, specific scalar <br>
estimates, not representations of intervals.764<br>
<br>
Assuming that perception represents intervals makes prima facie nonsense of such <br>
work. The interval idea would at the very least require a major reinterpretation of the <br>
work. No good reason has been given for doing so. One cannot know, from armchair <br>
philosophical argument, whether or to what degree a set of perceptual representations in a <br>
perceptual system is accurate.<br>
<br>
A further problem for the proposal that attribution of scalar properties be counted <br>
accurate by taking them to represent intervals is that the experiments are not confined to <br>
attribution of scalar properties. As I indicated, experiments show degradations of ac cur-<br>
acy for movement up or down, two flashes or one, left flash before or after right flash. <br>
Error about these matters cannot be reinterpreted as representation of scalar intervals.<br>
<br>
Block emphasizes a difficulty in determining which definite, specific perceptual repre-<br>
sentation as of a scalar property is accurate, when one is backed by attention and another <br>
is not. He uses this difficulty as a supplementary motivation to count all relevant states <br>
accurate.765 It is true that it is a delicate matter to determine empirically which perceptual <br>
representations exhibit “ground-truth”—exact accuracy for scalar properties. There is no <br>
standard, general way.<br><br>

<b>FN</b>762 <i>Exactness</i> is a feature of the representational content of a particular state. It concerns whether the content <br>
specifies one scalar value. It contrasts with representation of intervals. <i>Precision</i> is a dispositional property of a <br>
perceptual capacity—the extent to which, in a given situation, perceptual states, given the same stimulation and <br>
holding other factors such as attention constant, yields states with the same or similar accuracy conditions (here, <br>
scalar estimates). Precision is a tendency to represent in ways that cluster closely around correct representation <br>
of a targeted distal stimulus.<br>
