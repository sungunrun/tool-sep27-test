598 Perceptual Memory: Short-Term Systems</div>
<br><br>
Symbolic working memory feeds long-term memory. Reciprocally, it can receive input <br>
from activated long-term memory.<br>
<br>
Retrieval of concepts expressed by words like ‘red’ or ‘piano’ can activate visual search. <br>
Linguistic working memory retains the symbolized concept to guide searches.909 I believe <br>
that the conceptual guidance is always via its initiating a match between the concept and a <br>
counterpart perceptual attributive—for example redp piano-shapep, or piano-bodyp.<br>
<br>
Analogously, working memory feeds long-term visual memory. Long-term visual as so-<br>
ci ations can also stimulate a perceptual content held in working memory so as to influence <br>
search.910 Conceptual long-term memory, perceptual long-term memory, and perceptual <br>
working memory, improve the speed and accuracy of search. For example, the behavioral <br>
effects of general knowledge about where a kettle is to be found in a cluttered kitchen are <br>
enhanced by holding a recently seen picture of a kettle in working memory.911 The as so ci-<br>
ation of the conceptual representations kettlec and kitchenc parallels an as so ci ation <br>
between perceptual attributives that are counterparts of the concepts: kettle-shapedpkettle-<br>
bodyp and kitchen-ensemblep of bodiesp. Perceptual working memory can be affected by <br>
these long-term perceptual-level associations. Usually, the long-term conceptual as so ci-<br>
ations will be caused by the long-term perceptual-level associations, though in principle <br>
causation could go either way.<br>
<br>
Working memory representations of size can be biased by long-term memory of an <br>
object’s normal size.912 Short-term memories are biased toward normal sizes of familiar <br>
objects, stored in long-term memory. Such biases are probably in place because, in a com-<br>
plex, dangerous world and with a noise-affected psychological system, it is safer for <br>
repeated perceptions stored in memory to guide action, even if this pattern yields errors in <br>
short-term memories of what was just perceived.<br>
<br>
Long-term memory can increase the number of items retained in visual working mem-<br>
ory.913 Long-term memory of familiar types of objects or patterns can also improve work-<br>
ing memory’s accuracy. Unfamiliar objects reduce its capacity and accuracy. For example, <br>
subjects perform better on working memory tasks with upright faces than with inverted <br>
ones, and with objects about which they are experts than with unfamiliar objects.914 <br>
Unconscious learning via working memory can build up information about statistical ten-<br>
dencies that can enable individuals to use working memory to remember more items, <br>
again by an analog of chunking. Subjects were shown displays of a few objects and asked <br>
to remember the objects’ colors. The subjects were unaware that some colors, in over 600 <br><br>
