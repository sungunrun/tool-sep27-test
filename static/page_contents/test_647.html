<b>Perception and Cognition<br><br>
</div>
</b>Encoded in the large, highly evolved sensory and motor portions of the <br>
<br>
human brain is a billion years of experience about the nature of the world and <br>
<br>
how to survive in it. . . . We are all prodigious Olympians in perceptual and <br>
<br>
motor areas, so good that we make the difficult look easy. Abstract thought, <br>
<br>
though, is a new trick, perhaps less than 100 thousand years old. We have not <br>
<br>
yet mastered it. It is not all that intrinsically difficult; it just seems so when <br>
<br>
we do it.<br>

Hans Moravec, <i>Mind Children: The Future of Robot and Human Intelligence<br><br>
</i>In Chapters 10–11, I sketched core perceptual processing. I emphasized that first forma-<br>
tion of perceptual states is very fast. I stressed that first-formed perceptual states do not <br>
depend on occurrent input from attention or memory. I emphasized that first-formed per-<br>
ception extends to categorization. In Chapter 11, I discussed recurrent processing and <br>
input from endogenous attention and memory into production of perceptual states, <br>
micro-seconds after the first perceptual states are produced. In Chapter 12, I elaborated <br>
two cases of probable perceptual attributives—cause and act—that are late, both in the <br>
order perception-formation and in the evolution of perceptual systems. I speculated on <br>
the existence of perceptual functional attributives.<br>
<br>
Chapters 13–18 centered on categorization and on capacities other than perception that <br>
are natural companions of perception—attention, conation, affect, memory, learning, <br>
anticipation, and imagining. I emphasized that each of these generic capacities has a <br>
perceptual-level species—a species that uses only perceptual attributives and that has <br>
operations that are not more advanced than those in perception-formation. Although it is <br>
not certain that conation uses only perceptual attributives, I conjectured that <i>all</i> attribu-<br>
tives in these associated, perceptual-level capacities are borrowed from one or another <br>
perceptual modality. I conjectured that representational conation adds only command <br>
mode, not attributives not already provided by perception. Even if this conjecture is mis-<br>
taken, there seems to be a level of explanation at which all motor attributives are embed-<br>
ded in operations not more sophisticated than those that occur in the perceptual <br>
modalities. With few exceptions (possibly episodic memory and endogenously controlled <br>
imagining), all the companion capacities evolved in conjunction with, not later than, per-<br>
ceptual systems.<br>
<br>
A central point of this work in Chapters 10–18 is to lay the groundwork for two themes.<br>
<br>
One is a conception of the visual system and visuo-motor system as large complexes. <br>
The former begins, after stimulus onset, with dominantly feed-forward processing, allow-<br>
ing input from the proprioceptive system and other systems, such as touch and hearing. <br>
These processes issue in simple, sketch-like categorizations, grounded in the inferior tem-<br>
poral cortex (IT), by 70–80 after stimulus onset. By 80–140 ms, input from task-relevant </div>
