422 Intra-Saccadic Perception and Recurrent Processing</div>
<br><br>
Other early processes besides contour integration provide shape cues for perception of <br>
surfaces and bodies. Boundaries of wholes can be found very quickly not only through <br>
registering edges, but also through registering boundaries in texture patterns. Such regis-<br>
tration often relies on lower spatial frequencies than those involved in contour detection. <br>
Textural boundaries are fairly well determined by about 90 ms after retinal stimulus, via <br>
firings in post-V1 occipital areas. Processing this information is dominantly feed-forward. <br>
This textural boundary information is projected forward to temporal and parietal areas <br>
between 104 and 120 ms.<br>
<br>
Surface segmentation is first supported by neural activity in V4 and the temporal area, <br>
and then projected back into the occipital areas, V1 and V2, by about 170 ms. Surface <br>
segmentation relies partly on cues from textural boundaries, which are computed more <br>
quickly. Feedback of surface segmentation to V1 and V2 by about 170 ms follows a pattern <br>
that has close analogs in various other aspects of the visual system. First, there are initial <br>
firings in V1 and V2 with very local response fields, followed by feedback from ana tom ic-<br>
al ly higher areas. Such feedback leads to re-tuning V1 and V2. The re-tuning supports <br>
responses to spatially larger units—here surfaces.519<br>
<br>
There is substantial evidence that, for cluttered scenes with hard-to-parse stimuli, the <br>
elementary operation of distinguishing figure from ground uses feedback from object <br>
templates, in memory or categorization, and uses prior training that affects feed-forward <br>
operations. The feedback from temporal (IT) and other areas, including the pre-frontal <br>
cortex, re-calibrates early areas, like V1 and V2, refining their first products. As noted, <br>
horizontal processing in V1 and some feedback from V4 occur even in relatively rapid, <br>
dominantly feed-forward contour integration.520<br>
<br>
After receiving feedback from V4 and temporal areas, where spatial constancies are first <br>
established, V1 appears to support perceptual constancies of contour shape.521 That is, a <br>
given contour shape can be attributed despite differences in orientation of the contour, <br>
hence large differences in the retinal image. V1 also seems to support perceptual constan-<br>
cies for surface orientation, surface shape,522 surface size,523 color, and lightness,524 in later, <br>
feedback stages.<br><br>
