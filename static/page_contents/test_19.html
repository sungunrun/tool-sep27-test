</b>…while a sense is what is receptive of sensible [or perceptible] forms without <br>
<br>
the matter, just as the wax receives the seal-imprint of the ring without the <br>
<br>
iron and the gold, but takes the golden or the brazen imprint, but not qua gold <br>
<br>
or bronze, yet in a similar way too the sense is affected by each thing that has <br>
<br>
color or flavor or sound, but not qua each of those being called, but qua of <br>
<br>
such-a-sort [paralleling qua as golden or as brazen], and according to propor-<br>
<br>
tion [or as a measurement]<br>

In <i>Origins of Objectivity</i>, chapter 9, I proposed a rough explication of what perception is. <br>
Here I set out that account with minor refinements. The explication is not a definition. It <br>
does not purport to give necessary and sufficient conditions. I think that the notion of <br>
perception is a primitive notion that cannot be defined in other terms in an illuminating <br>
way. The explication functions to provide orientation and background.<br>
<br>
Here is the explication:<br><br>
Perception is sensory, objective representation—paradigmatically by individuals—that <br>
is generated from current stimulation and normally (except in unusual circumstances) <br>
represents a roughly present subject matter as roughly present.<br><br>
I say ‘paradigmatically by individuals’. I doubt that all perception is <i>necessarily</i> attributable <br>
to an individual perceiver. Perhaps there are cases in which it is attributable <i>only</i> to an indi-<br>
vidual’s sub-system. I know of no clear cases. Certainly, all cases of perception occur in <br>
individuals and serve perception attributable to individuals. Paradigmatically, in di vid uals <br>
perceive.16 Here, the key concepts in this explication are sensory, representation, and objective.<br><br>

<b>FOOTNOTES</b><br>
<b>Cont FN</b>16 <i>Origins of Objectivity</i>, 369, where I write:<br>
<br>
I do not claim that <i>all</i> perceptions are perceptions by an individual. I claim that necessarily and <br>
<br>
 constitutively, some perceptions in an individual’s perceptual subsystem are perceptions by the <br>
<br>
 individual. And I claim that all perceptions, including any that are not attributable to the individual, <br>
<br>
serve perception by individuals.<br>
<br>
I do not push cases of perception that are <i>not</i> imputable to an individual. My reason for allowing for them is not that <br>
I have specific cases in mind. It is that I know of no apriori reason for disallowing them. I do not think that a percep-<br>
tion’s being inaccessible to consciousness, in itself, renders it a perception that is not attributable to the individual.<br>
<br>
I lay aside perception by groups. If there is such a thing, parallel points would apply. Paradigmatically, percep-<br>
tual states are attributable to the macro-perceiver, whether the individual or the group. Of course, all perceptual <br>
states attributable to perceivers are also attributable to their sub-systems. For criticism of a debate about uncon-<br>
scious perception that misuses my views on perception “by the individual”, see T. Burge, ‘Entitlement: The Basis <br>
for Empirical Warrant’, in P. Graham and N. Pedersen eds., <i>Epistemic Entitlement</i> (Oxford: Oxford University <br>
Press, 2020), 69n45.(<i>cont</i>.)</div>
