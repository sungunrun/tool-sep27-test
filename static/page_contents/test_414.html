Information from the right retina is conveyed to left LGN. Information from the <br>
left retina is conveyed to right LGN. LGN receives signals, not only from the eyes, but <br>
from other sensory organs, and from the cortex itself. In fact, it receives three times as <br>
much input from V1, the first cortical visual area, as from the retina. LGN has various <br>
functions—for example, control of the two eyes in converging and focusing on a plane, <br>
producing an elementary mapping of the retinal image, tagging prominent retinal <br>
velocities, and improving temporal redundancies between successive registrations of the <br>
ret inal image.<br>
<br>
Two further sub-cortical structures connected to LGN are the left and right superior <br>
colliculus. These latter structures function to support guiding exogenous visual attention— <br>
attention determined by a sudden movement, for example. They also figure in motion <br>
detection, sending very fast signals via the pulvinar pathway to MT/V5.493<br>
<br>
The most studied visual pathway exiting LGN conveys signals to the primary visual <br>
cortex, also known as the striate cortex, and as V1. V1 spans both hemispheres. It is <br><br>
