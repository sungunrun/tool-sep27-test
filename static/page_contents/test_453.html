Primitive Attribution of Mechanical Causation 453</div>
<br><br>
The fact that children may not be able to represent some types of causal relations is <br>
irrelevant to whether they represent causation as such. Some causal relations are too big or <br>
small to be appreciated by children. There are causal relations such as magnetic, electrical, <br>
or gravitational causation that children, and many adults, omit from their repertoire of <br>
causal representation. These points hardly show that the children or adults lack an attribu-<br>
tive for causation as such.<br>
<br>
Adults cannot identify all instances that satisfy their concepts. Thinking that children <br>
can represent causation only if they can identify all types of causation may derive from <br>
identifying content with verification conditions. This holdover from positivist views <br>
should be rejected. The basic causal content in primitive representation as of causation <br>
derives from children’s discriminative/representational tracking capacities. One can be on <br>
to an environmental attribute without being able to identify all its manifestations.<br>
<br>
Infants need not <i>understand</i> significant aspects of even the causal relations that they <br>
can discriminate. They may not understand that mechanical causation involves transfer of <br>
energy. Again, this point is not decisive for whether they represent causation as such. <br>
Adults often understand their concepts incompletely. The fact that infants (or apes) do not <br>
understand mechanism or other central features of mechanical causation is no ground for <br>
denying that a primitive attributive for causation occurs in their perceptual systems, or <br>
other low-level pre-propositional systems of representation. The fact that children see <br>
instances of and track the relation of causation in prototypical cases, and the fact that this <br>
tracking is best explained by their representations’ obtaining their content via sensory <br>
interaction with the instances of causation, suffice to establish that children represent both <br>
specific types of causation and a genus <i>causation</i>.<br>
<br>
Michotte thought that primitive causal representation is <i>innate</i>. He meant that although <br>
it is triggered by experience and other natural concomitants of development, it arises early, <br>
naturally, and automatically in individuals—independently of the content of their specific <br>
inferences or experiences. He had little evidence for his view. It remains controversial.<br>
<br>
I think that current evidence supports the hypothesis, though not overwhelmingly. Of <br>
course, 4–6-month-olds have time to <i>learn</i> that certain patterns of motion are distinctive. <br>
However, the specificity and regularity of the development favor the innateness hy poth-<br>
esis, perhaps with an overlay of learned variations. Moreover, it seems plausible that some-<br>
thing as central as causation would have been encoded into representational capacities <br>
over evolutionary time scales and not reserved for the learning histories of individuals.583<br>
<br>
I am less interested in the innateness issue than in the hypothesis that the most primi tive <br>
causal representation is perceptual. Michotte argued that primitive representation of caus-<br>
ation does not derive from propositional inference. The causal impression seemed to him to <br>
have the signature features of perceptual representation. The process of forming the causal <br>
impression is fast and automatic. It is not accessible to introspection, conscious guidance, or <br>
rethinking. The causal impression, like various perceptual illusions, is present and persists <br>
in equal strength, even though one believes that the phenomenon is not actually present.<br>
<br>
Subsequent research extended this last point. Dependence of the causal impression on <br>
minute differences in spatio-temporal arrangements and integration with very low-level <br><br>
