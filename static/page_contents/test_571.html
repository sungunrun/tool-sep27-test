of <i>perceptual</i>  priming as involving memory, at least in many cases. Pre-perceptual settings <br>
can, of course, also be changed by priming.<br>
<br>
Priming for features, like color, spatial position, spatial frequency, depends on uncon-<br>
scious short-term memory, not stimulus predictability. Experiments by Vera Maljkovic <br>
and Ken Nakayama teased apart these factors. They showed that sameness of stimulus, <br>
retained in short-term memory, not even <i>completely certain</i> anticipation of a stimulus, was <br>
the cause of typical priming changes. Typical changes like speeded response and distractor <br>
inhibition accumulate over several trials.815 Priming effects from stimulus repetition do <br>
not mainly derive from visual attention to the stimuli.816 Priming is a large factor in shap-<br>
ing exogenous attention.817<br>
<br>
Priming and priming-associated memory occur at various levels in the perceptual sys-<br>
tem. It is likely that priming occurs in different systems of perceptual memory, from short <br>
to long-term. That is, both priming and priming-associated memory interact with stimuli <br>
at different processing levels. Under some stimulus conditions, priming can affect process-<br>
ing of retinal motion at a pre-perceptual stage. Then, later <i>perceptual</i> representations of <br>
motion, embedded in a perceptual constancy, are derivatively affected by priming at the <br>
earlier stage, especially if retinal position of the motion is constant. Pre-representational <br>
effects of such priming are not stored in (representational) memory. The effects at the per-<br>
ceptual level may be.<br>
<br>
Under other conditions, priming is invariant to retinotopic position, suggesting that <br>
such priming directly affects a later, perceptual processing stage.818 Priming can operate <br>
directly at the level of higher-order spatial relationships among objects in a scene, reflect-<br>
ing abstract, gist-like perceptual constancies. In different stimulus conditions, priming can <br>
be feature-based, object-based, or object-part-based.819 Cases of priming associated with <br>
these various types of visual processing seem to be mutually dissociable.820, 821<br><br>

vision formed within 100 ms. See notes 791–792 above. He assimilates pre-cueing to an effect on attention. <br>
I think this assimilation not quite right. The priming that pre-cueing produces can operate independently of <br>
attention.<br>

cueing produces short-term perceptual learning, or at least a short-term analog of perceptual learning. Like <br>
Raftopoulos (see note 816), these authors rightly reject the idea that the production or results of priming in <br>
themselves constitute any sort of cognitive penetration into the visual system.<br>
