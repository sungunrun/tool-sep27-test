186  Form and Semantics of Perceptual Contents</div>
<br><br>
Priority of body (or any) representation is malleable. Shape tropes, such as instances of <br>
<i>cubical</i>, cannot <i>exist</i> without inhering in something—a body, a surface, an array of light. <br>
I think, however, that they can be perceived without attributing them to anything further. <br>
One might perceive a color-instance, without perceptually attributing color to any further <br>
entity. Perhaps such attributions of shape and color could occur even normally in simple <br>
psychological systems. They can almost certainly occur in human visual pathology or in <br>
unusual circumstances.<br>
<br>
Even when shapes and shape-instances are attributed to bodies, perception of the <br>
shape-instances can in principle have psychological priority over simultaneous perception <br>
of the bodies. So the referential applications to shape-instances can scope-dominate refer-<br>
ential applications to body-instances. Such priority is marked as follows:<br><br>
(that x3)[(that x1)(that x2)(brown(c)(x1), brown(i)(x2), cubical(c)(x1), body(i)(x1), <br>
<br>
cubical(i)(x3))].<br><br>
Note that the application marked by ‘3’ figures not only in the intra-attribute attribution <br>
marked by ‘cubical(i)(x3)’. It also figures in the cross-attribute attribution cubical(c)(x1), <br>
which attributes not only the type <i>cubical</i> but the betokened (perceived) instance of the <br>
type to the body. The applied determiner (that x3) binds the variable x3, as it occurs in both <br>
attributions.<br>
<br>
As noted earlier, I do not represented attributions of type and instance separately. For <br>
the attribution (as distinct from the perception) of the attribute-instance succeeds if and <br>
only if the attribution of the attribute-type succeeds.<br>
<br>
Flexibility in psychological priority among referential applications, and connections <br>
between scope and the two main types of attribution—the intra-attribute and cross-<br>
attribute attribution—bring out that we need to recognize additions to the already large <br>
trove of attributives that normally occur in perceptual states.<br>
<br>
Edges are always, or nearly always, perceived as edges or boundaries <i>of</i> something—a <br>
surface or a 3-D volume shape, a textural pattern, a body, a part of a rainbow. To capture <br>
abilities to track edges and to take them as bearers of properties, one should, I think, <br>
assume a one-place edge attributive. A psychology might set up a memory file that tracks <br>
an edge, perhaps as its attributes (for example, position) change. It might lose track of what <br>
the edge is an edge of. A relational attributive, x edge-boundary of y or x edge-of y, marks <br>
the visual competence to relate the particular edge to some other specific particular that it <br>
is seen as edge <i>of</i>—a surface or a body.<br>
<br>
Whether edges are always perceived not only as edges but as edges of something is an <br>
empirical question. They are certainly represented in both classifying and relational ways. <br>
I doubt that surfaces are always seen as surfaces <i>of</i> something—a body or a 3-D volume <br>
shape. In humans they usually are. In any case, the same considerations just expounded for <br>
the edge attributives reapply for surface attributives. When surfaces are presented in vision, <br>
they are commonly presented not only as surfaces, but also as surfaces of bodies. So there <br>
is a relational surface attributive, as well as the categorizing one-place surface attributive. <br>
Attributives are types of psychological competencies. Since there are two competencies, <br>
there are two attributives.<br>
<br>
I continue to table the iconic format of these perceptual attributives until Chapter 9.</div>
