326 The Iconic Nature of Perception</div>
<br><br>
by the intentional act of putting a picture part onto the canvass or interpreting a picture of <br>
a real particular, not by any picture part, token or type, taken on its own. The same colored <br>
shape could have represented a different particular, or no particular at all, in a different <br>
context. There are no two picture parts, one of which indicates a repeatable color property <br>
and another refers to a concrete instance of the property. In a perceptual state, reference to <br>
particulars is effected by occurrent events that instantiate a repeatable representational <br>
competence-type. No separate symbol or part of the content, of either a picture or a per-<br>
ceptual state, distinguishes the occurrent application from the representational, attributive <br>
type(s) that it applies.353, 354<br>
<br>
Depiction always involves a combination of occurrence-based singular application and <br>
a characterizing attribution. Like assertion and perception, depiction is not a semantical <br>
primitive—at least in cases of pictures that pick out particulars. Similarly, for maps and <br>
perceptual representation. All perception is via combinations of singular applications and <br>
attributions.<br>
<br>
A central way in which parts (ordinarily understood) in an iconic representation do not <br>
correspond to constituents resides in representation of <i>relations</i>. No <i>part</i> of a picture spe-<br>
cifically represents the depth relation between an object in the foreground and one in the <br>
background. Yet the picture pictures iconically the foreground object as closer than the <br>
background object.<br><br>

<b>FOOTNOTES</b><br>
<b>Cont FN</b>353 Both Fodor in <i>LOT 2: The Language of Thought Revisited</i>, 175, and J. Quilty-Dunn in ‘Iconicity and the <br>
Format of Perception’, <i>Journal of Consciousness Studies</i> 23 (2016), 255–263, take a <i>term</i> that symbolizes the singu-<br>
lar reference to be required, if an iconic representation (the whole perception or picture) is to represent a par-<br>
ticular. Quilty-Dunn writes, ‘. . . icons lack the representational apparatus to bind features by picking out an object <br>
and attributing those features to the object’ (261). To the contrary, that is exactly what paradigmatic icons, like <br>
realist paintings of individuals and like perceptions, do.<br>
Green and Quilty-Dunn, ‘What is an Object File?’, make much of the supposed non-iconicity of memory <br>
index files. Anaphoric or, alternatively, tracking applications in memory—in index files—that derive from refer-<br>
ential applications in perception may or may not have a ‘symbol’ that effects the reference. Such a symbol’s occur-<br>
ring would not prevent perceptual memory from being iconic. Memory files always contain more than the <br>
referential index. They contain attributives. Perceptual attributives in memory that guide a perceptual memory <br>
file remain iconic. The file cannot represent without some, perhaps changeable, attributional guidance. Since <br>
iconic representations can have non-iconic, even symbolic elements, presence of a symbol in memory files would <br>
not prevent them from being iconic.<br>
Moreover, if symbols are arranged in relations that bear natural correspondences to relations in a subject mat-<br>
ter, the arrangement of symbols is iconic. Recall the example of matches representing tanks, and the iconic repre-<br>
sentation of positions of light-rail stations by the arrangement of their names. (This chapter, the section <br>
Noun-Phrase-Like Structure and Iconic Representation in Perception.) As the light-rail <br>
map example indicates, many iconic representations have non-iconic symbolic elements. However, a symbol is <br>
not needed in perceptual memory that functions to retain perceptual singular reference, any more than a symbol <br>
for a referential application is needed in perception, or indeed in natural language. Both anaphoric and non-<br>
anaphoric tracking can be effected through occurrent events that are causally and functionally connected to the <br>
occurrent referential application event(s) involved in the original perception(s). Such a causal connection can <br>
underlie the changing iconic perceptual attributives that guide reference by the memory file. There need be no <br>
symbol for either a perceptual referential application or the file itself—a referential application in memory fed by <br>
perceptual applications.<br>
A significant error in Quilty-Dunn’s article is mis-attribution to me, in <i>Origins of Objectivity</i>, of the view that <br>
the difference between perception and cognition consists (sometimes he says ‘partly consists’) in perceptual rep-<br>
resentations’ being iconic, and in cognitive representations’ being discursive, or language-like. No passage is <br>
cited to support the attribution. I think that some cognitive, even propositional, representations are iconic. <br>
I think that <i>all</i> beliefs immediately formed from perception<i>—perceptual beliefs</i>—are iconic. (See Chapter 6, the <br>
section Perceptual Contents, Propositions, and Noun Phrases.)<br>
354 One can take statements, as distinguished from sentences, to be hybrid combinations of application event <br>
tokens and attributive (and schematic) types. Then one could count the event tokens as parts of the statements. <br>
Of course, this is not an intuitive notion of <i>part</i>. It is a notion motivated by a serious semantics. The event tokens <br>
are still not symbols.</div>
