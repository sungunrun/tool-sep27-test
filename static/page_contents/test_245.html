Accuracy Conditions for Attributives in Constancies 245</div>

perceptual state derives from the fact that it does not represent the color-shade in a way <br>
appropriate to its lighting conditions.<br>
<br>
It may well be that in this case, the problem arises only because the full representational <br>
content of the perceptual state has not been displayed. No indication or attribution of il lu-<br>
min ation is included in the displayed formulation of the representational content. If one <br>
included attributives for illumination, the second perceptual state would be inaccurate. For <br>
the attributive would attribute white illumination whereas the illumination is in fact red.<br>
<br>
This response may be correct as far as it goes. <i>If</i> illumination is among the <i>representata</i> <br>
in the accuracy condition of the perceptual state—, then a simple extension of the ac cur-<br>
acy conditions just sketched handles the intuitive problem. It is not, however, known <br>
whether there are perceptual constancies for illumination, or whether illumination is rep-<br>
resented, as distinguished from just informationally registered. (See Chapter 7, the section <br>
Minimalism: Defocus and Color Constancy.)<br>
<br>
The issue whether and in what sense illumination is represented in vision is connected <br>
with an area of research that bears on relations between visual systems and the <i>physical <br>
light field</i>—the luminance as a function of spectral energy (wavelength), position, and <br>
direction in regions of space. A plane (roughly) in the physical light field is the proximal <br>
stimulus for vision. It is the plane of luminance that affects the retinal sensors. The full <br>
physical 3-D light field extends well beyond the sensors. What information about this 3-D <br>
light field is coded in a visual system?<br>
<br>
The issue is framed by this fact. Light cannot be seen, unless one looks at the source, or <br>
unless light reflects off an occupant of space. So when, intuitively, we see shafts of light, we <br>
are seeing particulate matter off which light reflects. The relevant body of research centers <br>
on light, whose properties are recovered from its effects (shadows, highlights) on perceived <br>
objects. The properties coded are gross direction patterns (in broad spatial zones), diffuse-<br>
ness, and intensity. It is plausible that these properties and relations can be represented <br>
perceptually, though some authors do not regard it as established that they are. <br>
Representing the attributes perceptually would depend on transformations from states in <br>
perceptual constancies for other attributes, such as positioning of a surface in 3-D space. If <br>
such light properties are represented perceptually, representation of them enters into the <br>
accuracy conditions of a perceptual state.226<br>
<br>
There are limits to how much of the light patterns are represented, if any are repre-<br>
sented. Certain aspects of light affect visual perception without being perceptually repre-<br>
sented. The problem of the drawing that we began with could be resurrected for such <br>
cases. <i>Atmospheric perspective</i>, sometimes called ‘aerial perspective’, is the effect of the <br>
atmosphere on the appearance of an object, viewed from a distance. At certain distances, <br>
contrast between an object and its background decreases. The object’s apparent color is <br><br>
