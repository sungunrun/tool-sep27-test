Attention commands thereby guide perceptual representation.1153 They utilize percep-<br>
tual attributives and sometimes referential applications. Endogenous perceptual attention <br>
is often not driven by beliefs or intentions. (See Chapter 15.) Such commands can occur <br>
multiple times in a second. By far the majority are automatic responses to contextual needs <br>
and perceptual-level conation. For example, they govern covert attention shifts between <br>
saccades, driven by task-relevant representation, often in peripheral vision. Such com-<br>
mands coordinate with motor commands that initiate saccades. The attention commands, <br>
their effects, and the conative target representations and motor commands are all <br>
perceptual-level. The operations governing them are also perceptual-level. Standard com-<br>
putational accounts include them in the visuo-motor system.1154 (See Chapter 15, the last <br>
two sections.)<br>
<br>
When endogenous attention commands are caused by beliefs or intentions, they can be <br>
counted cognitively driven. The direct commands themselves are perceptual-level. In such <br>
cases, selectional effects in visual processing are indirectly caused by cognitive states that <br>
cause the perceptual-level attention commands.<br>
<br>
The same types of perceptual-level attention commands and attention effects can occur <br>
with or without propositional or other cognitive states as causal antecedents. The com-<br>
mands and effects do not in general depend on having such antecedents. When attention <br>
commands <i>are</i> cognitively driven, the commands are inputs into perceptual-level compu-<br>
tations; the cognitive “drivers” are not. Their effects are from outside the process for which <br>
we have computational models. Cognitive drivers often cause effects in principled content-<br>
relevant ways—effects like perceptual-level attention commands and motor commands. <br>
The cognitive drivers are not, however, inputs into computations of either perceptual states <br>
or perceptual-level auxiliaries, like the commands.<br>
<br>
So beliefs and intentions operate, non-pathologically, on visual processing only via <br>
perceptual-level attention commands, perceptual-level motor commands, or perceptual-<br>
level memories. Noting this indirectness is important but <i>not</i> sufficient for understanding <br>
why the counter-examples are non-revolutionary. As some proponents of the counter-<br>
examples recognize, attention commands, motor-commands, input from perceptual-level <br>
memory <i>are</i> part of the visual or visuo-motor system. Some proponents find it niggling <br>
for opponents to insist that propositional cognitive states do not directly affect one <i>part</i> of <br>
that system—the formation of perceptions.<br>
<br>
I do not doubt that there are cases of indirect cognitive causal influence on aspects of <br>
visual processing as it occurs—cases of cognitive penetration, understood in the ways this <br>
phrase is conventionally understood. The cases of cognitively driven attention, motor <br><br>

<b>FOOTNOTES</b><br>
<b>FN</b>1153 Gross, ‘Cognitive Penetration and Attention’, draws the distinction between attention initiations or com-<br>
mands and attentional effects, presumably for endogenous attention, very clearly. The anatomical basis for some <br>
initiation is known—for example, feedback supported by the frontal eye fields, parietal areas, or other visuo-<br>
motor areas that feed into the central perceptual processing stream. These matters are discussed Chapter 15, the <br>
section Sources and Levels of Attention.<br>
Attentional feedback into visual processing is associated with lower-level aspects of the executive control sys-<br>
tem. See Chapter 15, the section Attention, The Executive Control System, and Propositional <br>
Drivers. Compare Lee and Maunsell, ‘A Normalization Model of Attentional Modulation of Single Unit <br>
Responses’; Reynolds and Heeger, ‘The Normalization Model of Attention’.<br>
<b>FN</b>1154 Gross, ‘Cognitive Penetration and Attention’, waffles on whether the attention commands or initiations are <br>
“cognitive”. I think that the ones that invoked in computational models are clearly not cognitive. They are very <br>
much like low-level motor commands.</div>
