<b>Conation: Relatively Primitive,  <br><br>
Perceptually Guided Action<br><br>
</div>
</b>In the beginning was the act.<br>
<br>
Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, <i>Faust<br><br>
</i>Sensory systems, including perceptual systems, evolved because they were part of a pack-<br>
age of capacities that serve action and reaction. Evolution of perception was not driven <br>
basically by its accuracy, but by its contribution to the survival value of action and reac-<br>
tion. In nature, perceptual systems are always linked to systems for generating action or <br>
other responses to the world. This book is primarily about perception. I discuss relations <br>
between perception and action to place perceptual and supra-perceptual representation in <br>
a realistic psychological setting. I stress that, despite its complexity, the motor system is <br>
representationally low-level. Processes that yield perceptually guided action occur at the <br>
representational level of perception. In fact, at this level, representation by conative states <br>
is, largely or wholly, via content derived from perception.<br><br>

<b>Action Imperialism<br><br>
</div>
</b>I start by criticizing claims that representational perceptual content is to be accounted for <br>
in terms of the actional consequences of sensory intake, or dismissed in favor of accounts <br>
that center on action, not representation. I call such accounts cases of ‘<i>action imperialism</i>’.<br>
<br>
Most action imperialisms are slight liberalizations of behaviorism. They show up in <br>
both philosophy and psychology. They have lost any serious place in mainstream percep-<br>
tual psychology.<br>
<br>
A classical over-emphasis, in psychology, of action in understanding perception was <br>
Gibson’s view that perception is fundamentally, even only, about affordances—functional <br>
properties, like <i>danger</i> and <i>shelter</i>.669 There remain Gibsonian echoes in a small fraternity <br>
of perceptual psychologists and from some philosophers influenced by Gibson.670 These <br><br>
