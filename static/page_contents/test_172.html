172  Form and Semantics of Perceptual Contents</div>
<br><br>
I proceed on the assumption that the intuitive difference between ‘x is an instance of <br>
<i>cubical</i>’ and ‘x is cubical’ can be captured without postulating two one-place attributives <br>
that indicate <i>cubical</i>. There <i>is</i> an intuitive difference between ‘x is an instance of <i>cubical</i>’ <br>
and ‘x is cubical’. I think the distinction sufficiently captured on the assumption that <br>
cu bic al is univocal across the two cases. It attributes the same attribute-type in both cases, <br>
but in different ways: by <i>intra-attribute attribution</i> and by <i>cross-attribute attribution</i>.<br>
<br>
So I refine our specification of representational content, just above, to:<br><br>
(that x1)[(that x2)(that x3)(brown(c)(x1), brown(i)(x2), cubical(c)(x1), cubical(i)(x3), <br>
<br>
body(i)(x1))]<br><br>
The subscripts ‘(c)’ and ‘(i)’ on the attributives mark the attributives as engaging in cross-<br>
attribute attribution and intra-attribute attribution, respectively.<br>
<br>
A perceptual attributive can exercise these functions (intra-attribute and cross-attribute <br>
attribution) even if it fails to indicate or betoken anything. Then it attributes nothing. It <br>
does exercise its attribution function. It functions to make a certain type of attribution, <br>
even if it does not connect to the world well enough to fulfill the function. Perceptual <br>
states are individuated by their representational functions, and their capacities to exercise <br>
these functions. The complex results of these exercises set accuracy conditions.<br>
<br>
The second distinction among types of attribution concerns what is attributed—<br>
attribute-type or attribute-instance. In cross-attribute attribution, if an attributive suc-<br>
ceeds in indicating an attribute-type and betokening an attribute-instance, then when it is <br>
applied, it attributes both type and instance. Suppose that the visual perceptual state<br><br>
(that x1)[(that x2)(that x3)(brown(c)(x1), brown(i)(x2), cubical(c)(x1), cubical(i)(x3), <br>
<br>
body(i)(x1))]<br><br>
is accurate. Then it succeeds not only in indicating <i>brown</i> and <i>cubical</i>, but also in betoken-<br>
ing instances of those types. The attributives brown and cubical attribute their indicated <br>
<i>types</i> (<i>brown</i> and <i>cubical</i>, respectively) to a particular body. They also attribute the <br>
be tokened instances of those types to that body. And the body has the relevant attribute-<br>
types and attribute-instances.<br>
<br>
The attributions of indicated type and betokened instance, in each case, are always <br>
coordinated—they go together—when both indication and betokening succeed. For each <br>
attributive, they are different attributions, different kinds of attribution. I call the former <br>
‘<i>cross-attribute attribution of an attribute-type</i>’, and the latter ‘<i>cross-attribute attribution of <br>
an attribute-instance</i>’.<br>
<br>
In intra-attribute attribution, only indicated attribute-types are attributed to an <br>
attribute-instance. As far as I can see, attribution of instances occurs only in cross-attribute <br>
attribution in perception. The point applies to both perception and perception-derived <br>
states, like perceptual memory and perceptual belief. No betokened attribute-instance is <br>
attributed to itself. I see no relevant function for attributing an instance of <i>body</i>, to itself—<br>
or an instance of <i>brownness</i> to itself.<br>
<br>
With these points about referential applications and perceptual attributives in hand, <br>
I return to the semantics of these structures. I emphasize again that all the representational </div>
