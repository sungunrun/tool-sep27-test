Egocentric Spatial Indexes in Perception 257</div>
<br><br>
None of this is to say that there are no object-centered frameworks, or other allocentric <br>
frameworks, in visual perception. It is just to say that they are not basic. They are always <br>
connected to egocentric frameworks. They do not do the full job of mapping shape and <br>
other spatial attributes. They must be coordinated with egocentrically anchored frame-<br>
works. I return to object-centered frameworks at the end of this subsection.<br>
<br>
A residue of Marr’s proposal is recurrent careless use of the basic notions of ego cen tri-<br>
city and allocentricity in the scientific literature. Sometimes retinal and other pre-<br>
representational forms of information registration are taken to be in “egocentric” spatial <br>
frameworks. Frameworks that perceptually represent physical space are sometimes taken, <br>
<i>ipso facto</i>, to be “allocentric”.243<br>
<br>
This terminology is misleading. Invitation to confusion is two-fold. First, the ter min-<br>
ology blurs information registration that correlates closely with the retinal image (the <br>
array of light hitting the retina) with perceptual representation, which has as <i>representata</i> <br>
entities in the distal spatial environment. It tends to assume that the former is “egocentric” <br>
because of this relation. If retinal registrations represented environmental spatial at tri-<br>
butes at all, they would, trivially, be egocentric or viewer-centered. Although retinal regis-<br>
trations correlate with positions in the retinal image, they do not represent anything, in <br>
the sense of ‘represent’ that I am using—a sense that corresponds to scientific usage of <br>
‘estimation’ of environmental attributes. So a contrast with (representational) allocentric <br>
mappings would be misleading. Second, representing distal physical space does not make <br>
a framework object-centered or otherwise allocentric. Being allocentric or egocentric has <br>
to do with how a representational framework is anchored, not what its subject matter is.<br>
<br>
The idea that shape representation is purely in an object-centered, allocentric frame-<br>
work still occurs occasionally, even in sophisticated articles. For example, Goker Erdogan <br>
and Robert Jacobs propose that visual perceptual representation of 3-D volume shapes <br>
occur (apparently purely) in object-centered frameworks.244 It is plausible that visual 3-D <br>
volume shape representation includes object-centered frameworks. Further, at some level <br>
of processing—certainly at some conceptual levels—object-centered frameworks are <br>
extracted from egocentric frameworks. And they are employed in ways fully free from <br>
egocentric frameworks. But the idea that visual perceptual shape representation occurs <br>
<i>outside</i> any egocentric framework is, I think, without merit.<br>
<br>
The authors claim, ‘ . . . people discount viewpoint to a large extent when judging simi-<br>
larities [of shape]’.245 This discounting is the result of the natural focus on a constant shape <br>
in a shape constancy. The authors present no evidence that perspective is <i>lost</i> or dispensed <br>
with in the perceptual representation of shape. As we shall see in Chapter 9, the section <br>
Iconic Aspects of Perceptual Spatial Representation, there is very sub-<br>
stantial evidence that spatial perspective is not lost in perceptual representation of 3-D <br>
volume shape. Thus the double-indexing that involves a shape-representation’s not only <br>
representing shape, but representing it in a specific perspectival way, in any given case of <br>
perception, is completely consistent with the authors’ results.<br><br>
