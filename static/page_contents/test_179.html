<br>
(ego-here x1)(that x2)(that x3)(body(i)(x2), body(i)(x3), farther-than(c)(x2, x3, x1))<br><br>
These are read:<br><br>
that x1 body, that x2 body, x1 being larger than x2<br><br>
ego-here x1, that x2 body, that x3 body,<br>
<br>
x2 being farther than x3 with respect to x1.<br><br>
The English noun phrases are awkward. Even so, they render the perceptual contents <br>
roughly.<br><br>

<b>Scope Hierarchies in Perceptual Content<br><br>
</div>
</b>In this chapter’s section Perception of Property-Instances, I illustrated the <br>
form of some perceptual representational contents. The illustrations contained a widest-<br>
scope referential application that functioned to apply to a body. The scope was wider than <br>
that of the referential applications that functioned to apply to color and shape-instances. <br>
In the preceding section, Perceptual Attribution of Relations, I illustrated <br>
some perceptual contents in which three referential applications shared widest scope. Are <br>
these illustrations arbitrary with respect to scope? If not, what determines scope of refer-<br>
ential applications in a perceptual representational content?185<br>
<br>
There is a fundamental motivation for taking some referential applications in perception <br>
to have widest scope. Form follows function. The function of perception is to pick out par-<br>
ticulars partly by characterizing them. So the form is nominal, not propositional. Is there <br>
any motivation for taking some referential applications in the noun-phrase-like structure of <br>
perception to have different scopes? Or do all referential applications have widest scope?<br>
<br>
Scope in logical form of <i>sentences</i> usually concerns the logical role of quantifiers, <br>
 determiners, or other operators. In language, some scope differences matter to truth <br>
 conditions; others do not. For example, in<br><br>
(∀x)(∃y)Larger-than(x, y)<br><br>
the quantifiers cannot exchange places without changing the sentence’s truth conditions.<br>
Similarly, in<br><br>
(∀x)[(∃y)Brown(y) → Cubical(x)].<br><br>
If the existential quantifier, ‘(∃y)’, were to be moved from governing just the antecedent <br>
of the conditional to governing the whole conditional, the result would set a different <br>
truth condition.<br>
<br>
On the other hand, some scope differences do not set different truth conditions.<br><br>
