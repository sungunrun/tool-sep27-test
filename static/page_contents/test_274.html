The points about the potential for change of a bearer’s attributes over time affect the <br>
form of the perceptual representational content. I do not develop these complications in <br>
detail. But it is worth saying a bit more about them here. A body could be perceived as <br>
changing its features, whether or not it moves. Inasmuch as <i>brown</i> and <i>cubical</i> are at tri-<br>
buted (in the cross-attribute way) to a body, the conditions for the attributives’ being <br>
ac cur ate of the body are time-relative. So as mentioned, brownr1(c)(x1) and cubicalb1(c)(x1) <br>
should be replaced by temporally relative attributives. The time parameter should change <br>
over the span of the broad present time established by now xt1, <t1, t1+n> ≊ xt. So, as time <br>
passes in the interval between t1 and t1+n, the feature attributives apply not only to the <br>
body but to each passing moment—even assuming that the body is not perceived as <br>
changing attributes during the time interval. If it does, then the new attributive will replace <br>
the old one and itself take on as time parameter the time at which the perceived <br>
change occurs.<br>
<br>
Here emerges a difference between forms of intra-attribute attributions and cross-<br>
attribute attributions. A body can be brown at one time and green at another. But a <br>
feature-instance—say, an instance of <i>brown</i>—cannot change from being an instance of <br>
brown to being an instance of some other feature, although the mode of presentation for it <br>
can change. So the attributive browna1 applied to an instance of <i>brown</i> is not relativized to <br>
a time. It is non-relational—one-place.<br>
<br>
This point requires refinement in our understanding of attribution. The relational <br>
attributive browna1(c)(x1, t) (applying to a body at a time t) functions to attribute the <br>
attribute-type <i>brown</i> to the body relative to a time. The time-relative attributive betokens <br>
an instance of <i>brown</i>, and attributes that instance, as well as the type <i>brown</i>, to the relevant <br>
body. I think that that attributive may also function to attribute a token of the relation <i>__<br>
brown at __</i> (assuming there is one) to body and time.<br>
<br>
The relational and non-relational attributives are, of course, not the same attributives. <br>
So, strictly, the superscript ‘a1’ cannot mark them as the same. The relational attributive <br>
indicates and attributes a relation. The non-relational attributive indicates and attributes <br>
only the property-type. The two attributives are, however, constitutively connected. They <br>
attribute the property-type <i>brown</i>. As contents of a perceptual state, they betoken the same <br>
instance of <i>brown</i>. Further, they attribute the same property and the same property-<br>
instance under the same stimulus and perspectival condition. I propose to mark the con-<br>
nection with the superscripts ‘a1’, which is subscripted as ‘a1(c)’ or ‘a1(i)’ to indicate strictly <br>
different contents. They set different conditions for being veridical. So they have different <br>
modes of presentation. There is an intuitive sense in which the two attributives share a way <br>
of presenting the given property-instance of <i>brown</i>. The perception of the color and the <br>
attribution of the color in the time-relative way to the body derive from the same proximal <br>
stimulus and filter out the same illumination. The two attributives respond to the same <br>
lighting and scene conditions and play the same role within the relevant perceptual con-<br>
stancy. Similar points apply to the two attributives that betoken the instance of <i>cubical.<br>
<br>
</i>So a <i>somewhat</i> less idealized content that still specifies only the beginning and endpoint <br>
of the motion, within the duration of the perceptual state, and specifies the body and its <br>
features at only one time during the motion—say, the start time—is as follows:<br><br>
(here-cego xp)(nowego xt)(now xt1, <t1, t1+n> ≊ xt)(that x1)(that x4)[(that x2)(that x3)<br>
<br>
(brownr1(c)(c)(x1, xt1), brownr1(i)(i)(x2), cubicalb1(c)(c)(x1, xt1), cubicalb1(i)(i)(x3),</div>
