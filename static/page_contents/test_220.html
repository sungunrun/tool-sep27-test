specific shape or size. The point applies equally, however, to relational spatial attributes, <br>
like ordinal depth, orientation, distance from the viewer, distance between two perceived <br>
entities. I will explain the point through a series of reflections.<br>
<br>
The three conditions follow:<br><br>
(1) The egocentric coordinate system is fixed to the perceiver—for example, to the <br>
<br>
cyclopean eye.216<br>
<br>
(2) The relevant spatial attributes are represented by means of the coordinate system.<br><br>
Given these first two conditions, spatial attributes are not represented via an attributive <br>
that—like the linguistic predicate ‘length <i>l</i>’ or ‘3 meters long’—might place the attribute in <br>
a coordinate system, but does not use a coordinate system in representing the attribute. <br>
Meeting condition (2) requires situating any attribution within a network of other attribu-<br>
tions. It requires an environmental edge to be specified not merely as an edge with length <br>
<i>l</i>. It requires it also to be specified in a way that situates, or maps, or <i>plots</i>, the edge and <br>
length via a coordinate system. Spatial <i>plotting</i>, or spatial mapping, is representing length <br>
and shape, using the system’s spatial specifications. I use the term ‘<i>plotting</i>’ rather than <br>
‘mapping’, because there are other types of mapping in my account, for example, mapping <br>
of retinal images, that are distinct.<br>
<br>
Spatial plotting is not <i>tracing</i>. Tracing is extended in time. Tracing also occurs in <br>
vision—for example, in visual search that follows a curving line in space. But tracing is <br>
distinct. Plotting represents units, such as edges, as <i>wholes</i>, normally not via temporally <br>
extended tracing. Spatial plotting, or spatial mapping, is not trans-temporal. Plotting <br>
specifies an edge length as a whole and also simultaneously represents parts of the edge of <br>
discernible sub-lengths. Connecting smaller units into larger units has already occurred at <br>
pre-perceptual processing stages. (See Chapter 3, the section Retinal Image Contour <br>
Registration and Surface Contour Perception.) Plotting also requires situ-<br>
ating an edge in a mapping of other edges, with some of their spatial properties and rela-<br>
tions. Spatial plotting connects any spatial specification with others in a system of <br>
specifications. There can, of course, be fragmented frameworks and frameworks with <br>
elem ents of indeterminacy.<br><br>
(3) There can be change in the spatial relation between the coordinate system and <br>
<br>
represented attribute-instances—either because the observer’s angle of view changes <br>
<br>
or because environmental entities change.<br><br>
I believe that all normally functioning systems of natural spatial perception meet these <br>
three conditions. If they are met, then for any given spatial attribute or attributive-complex <br>
that can be indicated and attributed in a perceptual system, there are multiple basic per-<br>
ceptual attributives (and attributive-complexes) in the perceptual system that can attribute <br>
that same attribute (or attribute-complex). I explain and develop this point in what follows.<br><br>

<b>Cont FN</b>216 Sometimes there are plural spatial coordinate systems. In mammals, one is anchored at the Cyclopean eye <br>
and another is anchored at each eye. I assume a single system here. The point applies, however, to any coordinate <br>
system that has the three relevant properties.</div>
