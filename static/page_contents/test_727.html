than some perceptually attributed relations. The example is typical of examples meant to <br>
show a move to higher-order relations in analogizing. What relations count as higher-<br>
order is not very clear.<br>
<br>
The danger of relying on the empiricist model here is obvious. Intuitive ideas of what is <br>
stimulus-driven or more abstract are poor bases for determining whether a representation is <br>
perceptual. One must reflect carefully, case by case, on whether relations that are intuitively <br>
more abstract, or are further from the intuitively concrete perceptually attributed relations, <br>
<i>are attributed in perception</i>. It is plausible, though not established, that actions are attributed <br>
in perception. Action attribution induces quite a number of relations (<i>target of</i>, <i>target-object <br>
of</i>, <i>by</i>, <i>to</i>, <i>with</i>) that are intuitively abstract and not stimulus driven. I see no reason why rela-<br>
tively simple types of <i>giving</i> could not be attributed in advanced  perceptual systems.<br>
<br>
There is indeed a progression, in child development and child learning, from a tendency <br>
to <i>focus</i> on properties like color and shape and simple spatial relations like <i>next-to</i> or <i>to the <br>
left of</i> toward a stronger disposition, at least with appropriate triggering mech an isms, to <br>
attend to and utilize a common generic relational structure in a wider range of con-<br>
texts.1183 A corollary of this progression is that individuals are quicker to be sensitive to <br>
the <i>roles</i> of particulars in a structure. Over the course of development and education, indi-<br>
viduals become better at focusing on similar roles of particulars in relations, despite differ-<br>
ences in perceived features of the particulars, and different roles of particulars in relations, <br>
despite similarities in perceived properties.<br>
<br>
This attention to and use of common relational structure across contexts is what is <br>
called attending to analogies and engaging in <i>analogizing</i>.1184 It has been claimed that <br><br>

‘Analogical Reasoning’. In what follows, I use ‘<i>analogical operation</i>’ or ‘<i>analogizing</i>’, instead of ‘<i>analogical reason-<br>
ing</i>’, because I question whether all operations commonly called ‘analogical reasoning’ involve reasoning. as <br>
opposed to perceptual-level operations, or cognitive operations that are non-propositional. I take reasoning to <br>
involve reasons, and I take reasons to be constitutively propositional. Reasons provide explanations or answers to <br>
potential why-questions. Only propositional contents can provide either. I cannot elaborate these points here. <br>
I cite them just to flag caution about assuming that analogical operations are all even cognitive, much less <br>
propositional-level.(a)(b)<br><br>
