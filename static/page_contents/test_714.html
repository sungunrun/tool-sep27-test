 followed the small-to-large strategy. To understand the visuo-motor system, there had to <br>
be a fairly secure grip on the visual system. To get a grip on the visual system, scientists <br>
had to understand various stages of processing, and their relations, if any, to memory, <br>
learning, and attention. Of course, despite this small-to-large emphasis, insight can always <br>
be multi-directional.<br><br>

<b>The Empiricist Model of Perception and Conception: <br>
<br>
Degrees of Abstraction<br><br>
</div>
</b>Before reflecting on distinguishing perceptual-level and cognitive capacities, I return to a <br>
traditional empiricist model of the distinction. This model remains prominent in psych-<br>
ology. I have criticized it several times. (See Chapter 4, the section Taxonomic <br>
Hierarchies in Perception and Chapter 9, the section Iconic Perception, <br>
Iconic Concepts, Iconic Representation in Propositional Thought; <br>
Chapter 13, the section Perceptual Categorization is Perceptual; Chapter 16, <br>
the section Conceptual Short-Term Memory.)<br>
<br>
An extreme ancestor of the model holds that all distinctions among all representations <br>
are present in the sensory intake of the representer. This view would disallow <i>concepts</i> for <br>
non-perceivables and concepts for perceivable entities individuated by their functions. <br>
I take it that few philosophers or psychologists are tempted by such a view now.<br>
<br>
A less extreme ancestor of the model holds that all distinctions among perceptual <br>
 representations are present in the initial sensory intake. On this view, since the percep-<br>
tual attributive for <i>body</i> cannot be distinguished in sensory intake alone from a perceptual <br>
attributive for a corresponding 3-D volume shape, there could not be two such percep-<br>
tual attributives. Similarly, there could be no perceptual attributives for causation. I rejected <br>
this view in discussing <i>body</i> and <i>causation</i> categories in Chapters 3–4, 11–12. Similar <br>
points apply to functional attributives. A predator does not produce different present sen-<br>
sory intake from a corresponding 3-D volume shape by which it is identified. A persistent <br>
theme in the book has been to reject this empiricist principle. Perceptual attributives are <br>
differentiated not just by present sensory intake but by <i>use</i> in conation, memory, and <br>
anticipation. Although some philosophers and psychologists accept this empiricist model, <br>
it has no support from mainstream computational perceptual psychology.<br>
<br>
The empiricist model that I target holds that conception differs from perception in <br>
being more abstract. Often it is added that concepts derive from perception by acts of <br>
abstraction.<br>
<br>
The briefest reflection undermines a simple version of this empiricist idea—the version <br>
that says that there is a continuum of abstractness, beginning with the concrete, specific <br>
imagistic states of perception and continuing up to the abstract, generic states of thought. <br>
To the contrary, any perception no matter how concrete can be conceptualized. As a con-<br>
sequence, using a mode of presentation individuated by a perceptual attributive, we can <br>
think propositionally about any attribute that we can perceive—say, any shade of color—<br>
no matter how concrete the property is. While perceiving the property, we can think about <br>
it, and as such, even if it is hard to remember it long-term.<br>
<br>
One can think propositionally using the most concrete iconic representation of the <br>
most concrete perceptually representable attributes. Relevant representational </div>
