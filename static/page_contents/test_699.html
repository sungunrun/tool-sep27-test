The Cognitive Penetration Controversy 699</div>

via affecting attention. They point out that attention is a standard topic in vision science. <br>
<i>Its</i> role in affecting perceptual states is postulated in classical models of visual functioning. <br>
So, they claim, invoking it is not plausibly taken to be invoking a “cognitive factor”. They <br>
add that if visual attention is to be taken as a cognitive penetrator, it is unclear why anyone <br>
should be interested in cognitive penetration. Further, it is merest common sense and <br>
never questioned in the science that attention can be affected by beliefs and belief-level <br>
intentions. So they dismiss such purported examples of cognitive penetration as non-<br>
revolutionary and uninteresting in the dispute over modularity.1147<br>
<br>
This response does not answer the way in which some opponents of cognitive pene tra-<br>
tion argue. Some opponents do not count attention or relevant attention commands cog-<br>
nitive. They regard attention as ‘cognitively driven’—caused in ‘content specific’ ways by <br>
states that are certainly cognitive—beliefs, belief-level intentions.1148<br>
<br>
Firestone and Scholl argue that there is no evidence against the view that ‘what and how <br>
we <i>see</i> is functionally independent from what and how we think, know, desire, act, and so <br>
forth’.1149 To the contrary, a belief that a red object of a certain shape is nearby and an <br>
intention to find such an object functionally affect feature-based and object-based atten-<br>
tion. They do so in normal, functional ways. The affected attention affects what and how <br>
one sees in a normal, functional way. One may see shape or color aspects of objects in dif-<br>
ferent ways, as a result of the initiation of attention and the belief and intention. The effect <br>
on perception, hence the effect of the belief and intention, can occur during perceptual <br>
processing. The effect of propositional attitudes on perception meets Firestone and Scholl’s <br>
stated condition for cognitive penetration of what and how we see. It constitutes a source <br>
of counter-examples to their claims. (See Chapter 15, the last three sections.)<br>
<br>
The difficulty is that Firestone and Scholl’s notion of being functionally independent is <br>
not strong enough to rule out “penetration” by belief and intention. When a belief or <br>
intention directs an initiation of attention and the attention affects ongoing perceptual <br>
processing (rather than merely setting what stimulus-input the system receives), the func-<br>
tioning of the system that contains the application of attention depends functionally—<br>
causally and in a “content-specific” way—on the belief and intention. So although this <br>
characterization avoids Pylyshyn’s metaphors of reason and logic, it does not rule out cases <br>
that impenetrability proponents want to rule out. Counting such cases non-revolutionary <br>
does not show that they are not cases of cognitive penetration, by the characterization of <br>
cognitive penetration that Firestone and Scholl employ.<br><br>

<b>FN</b>1147 Firestone and Scholl, ‘Authors’ Response: Seeing and Thinking: Foundational Issues and Empirical <br>
Horizons’, 42. They credit Ned Block, who dismisses MacPherson’s case in a similar way: Block, ‘Tweaking the <br>
Concepts of Perception and Cognition’, 22. He seems to regard relevant visual imagining as cognitive. He may <br>
accept the case as one of “cognitive” penetration. He asks, in response to MacPherson’s example, ‘if this is cogni-<br>
tive penetration, why should we care about cognitive penetration?’, because <i>that</i> sort of “cognitive” penetration <br>
does not threaten a joint between perceiving and thinking. I think it a mistake to take visual imagining as cogni-<br>
tive. Even so, the fact that the visual <i>perceptual</i> imagining is driven, in a content-specific way, by unquestionably <br>
cognitive states (propositional attitudes) makes the case a prima facie problem for defenders of impenetrability <br>
like Firestone and Scholl. I do not see that their formulations of impenetrability accommodate the cases. On the <br>
large issue, however, I think that they are right to characterize such cases as posing no threat to normal ways of <br>
doing vision science or to the idea that the visual perceptual system does not process cognitive representations <br>
computationally, even in its later stages, after 150 ms.<br>
