Linkage of Attributives in Perceptual Constancies 239</div>
<br><br>
Similarly, the relation between a perceptual attributive for a green color shade that <br>
applies veridically in bright sunlight and a linked perceptual attributive as of the same <br>
shade that applies veridically when a shadow falls on the color shade depends partly on <br>
the fact that, in normal conditions in the actual environment, edges of shadows are softer <br>
(produce a less abrupt shift in registered light frequency) than differences in surface <br>
reflectance. One’s capacity to see the surface as green, both when it is in shadow and when <br>
it is not, depends partly on the fact that the visual system registers the contingent, but <br>
deep, physical pattern just described into psychological laws governing perceptual-state <br>
formation. Such laws help make color constancy possible.221<br>
<br>
The empirical informativeness is implicit. The perceptual system does not represent the <br>
environmental patterns or laws. They are encoded in the system’s formation laws and in <br>
the ways attributives that are linked in perceptual constancies relate to one another. A sci-<br>
entist studying the perceptual system can recover the empirical information from under-<br>
standing how the system works.<br>
<br>
Thus empirical information carried by perceptual attributives linked in a perceptual con-<br>
stancy is often information about environmental patterns that relate different types of con-<br>
ditions under which instances of given attributes appear. Empirically informative patterns <br>
may occur in the perceptual system itself. The differences between foveated and unfoveated, <br>
focused and defocused representations connect to <i>intra</i>-psychological patterns that ground <br>
representational differences. Even in these cases, environmental patterns play a role.<br>
<br>
There are, I think, taxonomic truths that are in a sense “part of understanding” certain <br>
concepts and linguistic meanings, and yet can be known only empirically. For example, it <br>
is part of a relatively full understanding of the concept cat and of the meaning of the word <br>
‘cat’ that one understand that cats are animals. I believe that our knowledge that cats are <br>
animals is empirical. Cats are animals is, I think, a metaphysically necessary truth. It is, <br>
however, known only on the basis of empirical tracking of deep patterns in the phys-<br>
ic al world.222<br>
<br>
This case bears obvious similarities to the case of perceptual attributives linked in a <br>
perceptual constancy. There is a connection, through the nature of the representational <br>
contents of different attributives, to a common attribute. This connection is knowable only <br>
empirically.<br>
<br>
There remain differences between the conceptual and perceptual cases.<br>
<br>
In perception, an attribute that is <i>indicated and attributed</i> by linked attributives—an <br>
attribute that the attributives represent—is what is constant. In the cat-animal case, the <br>
represented attributes are different from one another. In the perceptual case, the differ-<br>
ences among the linked perceptual attributives are perspectival, not taxonomic. In per-<br>
ceiving something as green under different stimulus conditions and despite different <br>
illuminations of the green, one does not represent different types of green. One represents <br>
green (or a shade of green) in perspectivally different ways.<br><br>
