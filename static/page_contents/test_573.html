Visual Sensory Memory 573</div>
<br><br>
Some type of visual sensory memory is part of every known visual perceptual system. <br>
In mammals, there are two phases, or sub-systems, of visual sensory memory. One is a <br>
phenomenally conscious after-image which, in humans, is accessible to higher powers.<br>
<br>
The phenomenally conscious image, or ‘<i>sensory icon</i>’, is a residue from phenomenally <br>
conscious perception. This image persists for about 100–200 ms after offset of stimulation. <br>
How long it lasts depends on stimulus intensity and duration, and on previous and subse-<br>
quent stimulation. The longer a stimulus lasts, the shorter the subsequent sensory icon <br>
lasts. The more intense the stimulus, the shorter the sensory icon lasts after stimulus offset. <br>
The duration of the sensory icon is probably most nearly constant if it is measured from <br>
stimulus onset.<br>
<br>
The sensory icon was once thought to depend entirely on persistence of activity by <br>
photo-receptors and neurons in the earliest stages of visual processing. There is, however, <br>
evidence from staggered stereoscopic presentations that sensory icons can derive from <br>
binocular processing and contain stereoscopic depth representation. Thus at least some <br>
aspects of some sensory icons may depend on <i>perceptual</i>, not just information registra-<br>
tional, processing.825<br>
<br>
A second type of visual sensory memory is <i>iconic memory</i>. This is what Max Coltheart <br>
called ‘informational persistence’. Since informational persistence in iconic memory shows <br>
the results of perceptual processing, such as stereopsis and other forms of depth percep-<br>
tion, iconic memory is in some of its aspects a genuinely perceptual form of memory.826<br>
<br>
Both the sensory icon and iconic memory are named in ways that refer to their iconic <br>
format. This practice should not be thought to contrast them with non-iconic perceptual <br>
memory (in my sense of ‘iconic’—see Chapter 9). All perceptual memory has iconic for-<br>
mat. The labels are used because these primitive types of short-term memory are approxi-<br>
mately as rich as visual perception itself. Although other types of visual memory are <br>
iconic, they are more sketch-like.<br>
<br>
Iconic memory is both rational-access unconscious and phenomenally unconscious, at <br>
least inasmuch as it persists past fading of the sensory icon. One can think of iconic mem-<br>
ory as starting with the conscious sensory icon, but continuing as that icon’s unconscious <br>
underbelly after consciousness fades. Alternatively, one can think of iconic memory as a <br>
phase of visual sensory memory that begins when the sensory icon fades. In any case, <br>
representational content that represents the same attributes and particulars, outlasts the <br>
sensory icon. It persists at a level of detail somewhat less full than that of the sensory icon <br>
for about 500 ms from stimulus onset.<br>
<br>
Unlike the sensory icon, iconic memory is not influenced by the duration or intensity <br>
of the initial stimulus. Although spatial and color information are less precise than that of <br>
the sensory icon, iconic memory has a high representational capacity, almost comparable <br>
to that of the sensory icon and the initial perception.<br>
<br>
Evidence for iconic memory and its main properties derives from detailed reports after <br>
post-stimulus cueing, forced-choice tests, and priming experiments—not from free <br>
report. George Sperling established existence of iconic memory through an experimental <br>
design known as <i>partial report technique</i>. Displays of 12–18 letters in blocks were shown <br>
individuals for 50 ms. Subjects were asked to report as many letters as possible. They <br><br>
