shape with very specific locations of surface-parts. In principle, with sufficient cues, a per-<br>
ceptual system might commit itself to a determinate plotting of the occluded shape-aspect <br>
(for example, the exact contour of the boundaries of the occluded parts of the branch’s <br>
shape) and locations of parts, even though the occluded shape-aspects and parts are not <br>
perceived or remembered.<br>
<br>
It seems clear that such representational commitments are attributional. They derive <br>
entirely from plottings of shape in an egocentrically anchored spatial framework. There <br>
is no intuitive or theoretical ground to count them referential. The perceptual system <br>
lacks a uniqueness (the one and only) operator. (See Chapter 6, the section Absence <br>
in Perception of Negations, Conditionals, Disjunctions, and <br>
Quantifiers.) Its only referential capacity is via context-dependent, referential applica-<br>
tions, which depend here on causal-perceptual relations to relevant particulars. Here such <br>
relations are lacking. The ability-general, formally general attributions can be <i>semantically</i> <br>
singular. (For accounts of these notions, see Chapter 2, the section The Three <br>
Fundamental Representational Constituents in Perceptual States, <br>
including note 39.) By applying a spatial framework attributive, the perception could <br>
determine a unique shape and size and unique parts—via their occupying unique pos-<br>
itions at a time. The attributions could be plotted in a specific attribution of boundary <br>
positions. So maximally specific unseen shape-aspects and unseen parts could be attrib-<br>
uted—tagged to the plotted positions of the shapes. The attribution could in principle <br>
determine these things uniquely. It could be semantically singular. But the form that sur-<br>
face with such and such [determinately plotted] surface shape [entailing a specific shape <br>
for the occluded surface shape-aspects] with surface-parts in such and such positions <br>
[entailing parts in specific positions in the occluded surface, relative to the egocentric <br>
anchor] is schematic. No referential applications pick out unseen, unremembered <br>
particulars.<br>
<br>
The third case is similar. In a perception of an unoccluded body, there is no perceptual <br>
reference to the body’s non-facing surfaces or those surfaces’ parts, or to shape-aspects of <br>
those non-facing surfaces. No perceptual referential applications apply to them. A percep-<br>
tual anticipation is formed that schematically represents, in singular form, non-facing <br>
surfaces and their shapes. The perceptual state may involve attributions congruent with <br>
those in the perceptual anticipation state. For bodies that have not been previously seen <br>
from all sides, and perceptually remembered, the attributives for the unseen surfaces, <br>
surface-parts, and shape-aspects are likely to be generic. Such attributions would leave the <br>
specific shapes, specific parts, and parts’ locations of non-facing surfaces indeterminate. <br>
The generic attributions are of 3-D volume shape with surfaces that are occluded by the <br>
body’s facing surfaces. The specific positions of these surfaces and the specific 3-D volume <br>
shape are likely not to be plotted as being in determinate locations. They are likely to be <br>
indeterminate, but constrained as being within certain parameters.<br>
<br>
In principle, however, with sufficient cues, a perceptual state might plot in its spatial <br>
framework the specific locations of the body’s unseen surfaces, unseen surface-parts, and <br>
unseen specific unseen shape-aspects. Perceptual representations of these unseen aspects <br>
of the seen whole body would remain attributional not referential. If perceptual represen-<br>
tation is specific enough to attribute unique positions for the unseen aspects of the body, it <br>
would uniquely fix surfaces, shape (and size) aspects, and part positions by their positions <br>
in space. Perception representationally determines unseen particulars that instantiate Part–Whole Representation  345</div>
