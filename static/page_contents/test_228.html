228 Attributives, Referential Applications in Constancies</div>
<br><br>
In visual spatial perception, numerous specific attributions for lengths of edges; sizes of <br>
surfaces and bodies; shapes of edges, surfaces, and bodies; ordinal depths of edges and <br>
surfaces from the viewer; distances of edges, edge-parts, surfaces, surface-parts, bodies <br>
and body-parts from the viewer; orientations of edges and surfaces with respect to the <br>
viewer; and distances and ordinal depths of edges, surfaces, and bodies from one another—<br>
are normally jointly exercised in any normal, occurrent perceptual state. Hugely many <br>
non-relational attributives for spatial properties (with spatially based kind-attributives, <br>
like edge, surface, and body) are exercised jointly with a huge number of relational spatial <br>
attributives. The relational spatial attributives include both perspectival relations that <br>
include viewer position among the <i>relata,</i> and non-perspectival relations that are viewer-<br>
independent—such as distance of one perceived surface from another.<br>
<br>
The sub-capacities exercised in a perceptual state, specifically the attributives, are nat-<br>
ural psychological kinds. The causal, computational principles that govern their formation <br>
from hugely many possible types and combinations of proximal stimuli are the principle <br>
topic of perceptual psychology. Science would find it impossible to understand a complex <br>
occurrent perceptual state, if it did not break up the problem into a study of the sub-unit <br>
capacities that jointly compose the state. The generic types of attributives cited in the previous <br>
paragraphs exemplify these sub-unit capacities, at a generic level. It is known empirically <br>
that instances of these types of attributives are generated in visual perceptual states. Each <br>
generic type (for example, length) is a capacity for generating attributives for each of <br>
numerous specific lengths. Many such specific-length attributives are generated in any <br>
given perceptual state. As emphasized, the specific-length attributives are exercised <br>
together with attributives for other spatial properties and relations. If they were not, vision <br>
could not produce a broadly coherent system of spatial representations, in any given per-<br>
ceptual state—as it in fact does.<br>
<br>
It is natural to think that, in perception, everything that is represented is represented per-<br>
spectivally. This thought is correct. Minimalism purports to accept it, but in a special sense. <br>
Whereas it is natural to think that any specific representation of shape or length is repre-<br>
sented perspectivally, minimalism takes perspective to reside purely in the whole system of <br>
representations. For example, according to minimalism, there is only one (non-perspectival) <br>
one-place non-relational representation of the length <i>l</i> applicable to any straight edge. There <br>
is also only one orientation-<i>o</i>-from-ego-here representation that captures the specific slant <br>
of an edge. According to minimalism, perspective on the non-relational, edge length derives <br>
entirely from the attribution of orientation, which is a perspective-dependent relation. <br>
Minimalism holds that the representation of the non-perspectival, non-relational property <br>
<i>length l</i> is itself purely non-perspectival: there is only one one-place, perspective-free repre-<br>
sentation of that length in the perceptual system, according to minimalism.<br>
<br>
Thus consider, first, a perceptual state that represents a straight edge’s length, where the <br>
edge is the top or left edge of a flat rectangular surface, and the surface is not slanted; that <br>
is, it is oriented in the fronto-parallel plane. Then consider a perceptual state that repre-<br>
sents the same straight edge’s length, where the same flat surface is slanted 30 degrees <br>
top-side backwards from the viewer, and the bottom edge of the surface is in the same <br>
position as in the first case. Minimalism claims that in these two situations, the same one-<br>
place non-relational attributive for length <i>l</i> is used. In the first situation, the perceptual system’s <br>
only attributive for orientation <i>o0</i> is used. In the second situation, the perceptual system’s <br>
only attributive for orientation <i>o30</i> is used.</div>
