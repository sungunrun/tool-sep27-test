520 Perceptual-Level Conation and Action</div>
<br><br>
Conscious, guiding, aspects of action are not always slower to respond to new situ-<br>
ations. Mazzoni and Krakauer asked subjects to move their wrist so that their index fingers <br>
aligned with a cursor on an always-visible screen.712 The cursor began at screen-center, <br>
surrounded by a circle of 8 circles, so that the circles were 45 degrees apart. When a target <br>
circle lit up, subjects were to move the cursor to the lit-up circle, then immediately return <br>
it to screen-center. They could move the cursor at any speed, but they were not allowed to <br>
correct trajectory. Slow, smooth movement was in effect encouraged. After familiarization, <br>
the psychologists imposed a 45-degree counterclockwise perturbation on how cursor and <br>
index finger aligned. A normal motor command would yield a cursor movement 45 <br>
degrees off target. After two trials, this group of subjects was told that a force was being <br>
exerted on their cursor movements. They were told how to counteract it: aim 45 degrees <br>
clockwise from the target. Subjects immediately implemented this strategy and hit targets <br>
accurately. Surprisingly, as they continued to try to hit the target using their instructed <br>
strategy, their error rate grew. The direction of their cursors moved increasingly away from <br>
the lit-up target circle toward a circle 45 degrees counterclockwise from the target circle. <br>
Afterwards, subjects were questioned. They were, of course, aware and surprised at the <br>
onset of errors after implementing the strategy. None showed awareness of the directional <br>
nature of the errors.<br>
<br>
A second group was given the same perturbation without being told about it, or being <br>
given a strategy to counteract it. The rate and extent of their adaptation was not signifi-<br>
cantly different from that of the first group. In other words, the conscious, cognitively <br>
driven strategy did not interfere with the underlying adaptation to the perturbation.<br>
<br>
Mazzoni and Krakauer hypothesized that while first subjects were implementing their <br>
conscious strategy, they were adapting to the counterclockwise rotation, at a cost of not <br>
fulfilling the task requirement of hitting the target. They supported their hypothesis by <br>
asking subjects to stop using the conscious strategy and simply aim at the appropriate tar-<br>
get. There were directional errors at this point, but significantly smaller than a 45-degree <br>
error, indicating that there had been a partial adaptation to the perturbation. Finally, sub-<br>
jects were told that the rotational perturbation had been switched off and were asked to <br>
aim for the appropriate target. Substantial error aftereffects remained, but again support-<br>
ing the hypothesis that unconscious, low-level adaptation had occurred. The authors con-<br>
cluded that the motor system overrides a conscious strategy because of a need to resolve <br>
discrepancies between anticipations of target movement and visual feedback.<br>
<br>
Evidence that the first and second group’s adaptations took place in the same type of <br>
unconscious psychological system has two bases. First, the aftereffects in the two groups <br>
were similar. Second, the mean value of directional error in the second group after <br><br>
