two RDSs was always a standard size. The other RDS was the test stimulus. It had either <br>
been preceded by a valid cue—one that anticipated the position of the test stimulus—, an <br>
invalid cue, or a neutral cue. It is assumed that valid cues grab covert exogenous spatial <br>
attention. Depending on the absolute stimulus size, subjects indicated objects whose pos-<br>
ition had been cued to be 4–12% larger than they indicated objects whose position had <br>
not been cued. That is, an attended test-stimulus RDS that was in fact 4–12% smaller <br>
would be perceived as equal in size to the test stimulus. The effect was hypothesized to be <br>
a consequence of the size of the receptive fields of the underlying neurons, consequent to <br>
the application of attention.<br>
<br>
I believe that these experiments show that gains in spatial resolution, spatial dis crim in-<br>
ation, localization, and speed of processing that covert exogenous (and sometimes <br>
en dogen ous) spatial attention provides are often accompanied by small degradations in <br>
perceptual accuracy.<br>
<br>
Ned Block believes that both attended and unattended perceptions in the experiments <br>
are accurate. He thinks that perception represents <i>intervals</i>, for scalar attributes, not defi n-<br>
ite scalar values. Thus, insofar as an attention-backed perception seems to attribute a size <br>
of an RDS as equal in size with an unattended RDS that is in fact 8% larger, both percep-<br>
tions represent the RDSs as of a size with an estimated interval that would span the 8% <br>
difference. The attribution of the interval would be veridical of both sizes—that of the <br>
smaller attended RDS and that of the larger RDS.<br>
<br>
Block motivates this claim by appeal to a view of mine. He writes:<br><br>
What is the consequence of these facts for the veridicality of perception? One viewpoint <br>
<br>
says that perception is mostly slightly mistaken. We usually see length, speed and con-<br>
<br>
trast non-veridically, but the extent of error is small enough not to be problematic. <br>
<br>
However, the viewpoint cannot be right since it is only in virtue of a history of veridical <br>
<br>
representation both in our own lives and in the past of our species that our perceptual <br>
<br>
representations even have representational contents (Burge, 2010). Without such a his-<br>
<br>
tory of veridical representation it is not clear that perceptual representation really <br>
<br>
makes sense.758<br><br>
I do think that veridicality is constitutive to grounding contents of perceptual states. <br>
However, Block’s claim that it “cannot be right” that perception is mostly slightly mistaken <br>
has no good support in my work. Block does not quote or explain my explanation of the <br>
centrality of veridicality in determining contents of perceptual states. In fact, his use of my <br>
view is incompatible with my understanding of the role of veridicality in fixing representa-<br>
tional content.<br>
<br>
Here is some of what I wrote on the relation between the representational content of <br>
perceptual states and grounding that content partly in veridical perception:<br><br>
For an individual to have any representational state (such as a belief or a perception) as of <br>
<br>
a subject matter, that state must be associated with some <i>veridical</i> representational states <br><br>
