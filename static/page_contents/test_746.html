of perceptual memory and perceptual anticipation, there are no referential applications. <br>
(Chapters 17 and 18.) Even in these cases, unapplied schemas for referential applications <br>
scope dominate the perceptual attributives. The form remains nominal, not propositional.<br>
<br>
Almost surely, some representation is cognitive, but not propositional (Chapter 19, the <br>
section What Should Count as Cognition?). However, in the evolution of repre-<br>
sentation beyond the perceptual level, the emergence of propositional forms is the most <br>
momentous. This emergence provided the basis for explaining and understanding, not <br>
merely tracking, the world. Propositional forms can articulate why-questions and because-<br>
answers. They make possible reasons and reasoning, in full, unattenuated senses of these <br>
terms. They make possible science, understanding, morality, and the deeper sorts of art—<br>
enterprises that make representation a substantial contributor to goods of life.<br>
<br>
Central to understanding the emergence of propositional form is understanding how <br>
attribution took on other functions besides its one function in perceptual-level represen-<br>
tation, that of guiding referential application. Being freed from always guiding referential <br>
application enabled attribution to dominate a representational structure. Such domination <br>
marks propositional structure. (See Chapter 6, the section Absence in Perception <br>
of Negations, Conditionals, Disjunctions, and Quantifiers; Chapter 19, <br>
the section Psychological Systems and Psychological Kinds.)1209<br>
<br>
Taking on new functions, of course, depends on acquisition of new representational <br>
capacities. So understanding what is distinctive of propositional structures hinges on <br>
understanding the attributive capacities that pushed beyond guiding referential applica-<br>
tion. These new capacities made rational enterprises possible. Such enterprises peaked in <br>
science–and understanding of other sorts—and in morality.<br><br>

<b>Perception: The Seed of New Things to Live and Die For<br><br>
</div>
</b>Perception emerged in evolution as an aid to fitness for reproduction. It earned its keep not <br>
primarily by realizing its own distinctive representational functions, but by serving bio-<br>
logical functions. Still, causal patterns and causal laws incorporated a new kind of state–a <br>
state typed by the accuracy conditions that it sets. Given that perceptual representation <br>
sets accuracy conditions and undergoes a type of failure if those accuracy conditions are <br>
not met, perceptual states have a new function—being accurate. Success in being accurate <br>
is a new type of success.<br>
<br>
Grounding this new state-kind and this new function was a new capacity, a capacity to <br>
represent. Representation required capacities to mine registration of proximal stimulation <br>
for cues to the environment. Objectifying capacities to isolate cues to perception-independent <br>
conditions in the idiosyncracies of proximal stimulation are perceptual constancies. The <br>
states’ accuracy conditions center on distal matters.<br>
<br>
The representational point of perception is to pick out and track distal particulars via <br>
causal sensory relations to those particulars. So perception must pick out particulars rep-<br>
resentationally. This point serves biological needs because particulars within causal reach <br>
are what an organism must engage with successfully in order to eat, mate, and stay safe. <br><br>
