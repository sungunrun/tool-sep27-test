the science include computational transformations among psychological states (or represen-<br>
tations or representational contents) that are individuated in terms of their representa-<br>
tional properties. Change representational properties, and one changes the states.<br>
<br>
To establish (LOT*) one would have to show something <i>wrong</i> with such descriptions. <br>
This would be to show the science wrong. Science is not sacrosanct. Scientific theories are, <br>
by nature, open to criticism. However, nearly all successful criticism of statements of cen-<br>
tral laws in sciences that are as well-established as mainstream perceptual psychology is <br>
comes from within science. So far, attempts to support (LOT*) have not taken this form. <br>
The (LOT*) thesis has no scientific support as applied to vision. It is speculative phil oso-<br>
phy, at best. It is a product of falling in love with the computer analogy. Computation in <br>
vision is not in all ways analogous to computation by human-made computers. In our <br>
present state of knowledge, there is no reason to think that (LOT*) is true. I am interested <br>
in the science as it is, not as philosophical speculation maintains that it will be or must be. <br>
I therefore ignore (LOT*) in what follows.<br><br>

<b>Representational-Dependence Hierarchies in Perceptual Attribution<br><br>

</b>For an entity to be tubular, it must be tubular in one of many possible specific ways. It <br>
must have a specific radius and length, and specific curvatures on its sides and ends. <br>
Similarly, to be an entity with a connected outer boundary, a body must have a more spe-<br>
cific shape, such as one of the specific ways of being approximately cubical. In general, <br>
having a more generic property requires having a more specific version of the property.<br>
<br>
In perception, however, it is possible to apply an attributive at a more generic level with-<br>
out applying an attributive at a more specific level. In fact, it is known that more generic <br>
shape representations can be perceptually computed sooner than more specific represen-<br>
tations. The practical importance of determining a more generic shape sometimes leads to <br>
operations that, in effect, make bets on it before there is time to determine shape at more <br>
specific taxonomic levels. In some cases, perceptual representation of generic features pre-<br>
cedes perceptual representation of what Rosch called basic categories and also of any of <br>
the more specific types that any particular must instantiate.121<br>
<br>
There do seem to be some hierarchies of representational dependence in perception. <br>
Some conform to ontological dependence hierarchies. They do so not because of the onto-<br>
logical hierarchies <i>per se</i>, but because of causal dependencies that are specific to percep-<br>
tion. For example, one cannot see something as having a 3-D volume shape without seeing <br>
its facing a surface, and probably seeing that surface as a surface, or without seeing some of <br>
its boundaries as contours.122 To see a cube and see it as cubical, one must see a facing <br><br>
