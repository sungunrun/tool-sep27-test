that it is by law, perhaps even constitutively, dependent on cognitive—that is, supra-<br>
 perceptual-level—influence.646<br>

I think that there may be perceptual kinds marked by early perceptual processing. <br>
However, the view misses more fundamental perceptual and perceptual-level psy cho-<br>
logic al kinds that extend further and are richer in content than the very first formations of <br>
perception. These kinds include intra-saccadic processing up through enriched, detailed <br>
categorization. Quite a lot of trans-saccadic processing is perceptual-level. After its earliest <br>
stages in the first 150 ms, which already includes perceptual categorization, visual compu-<br>
tational processing takes substantial input from conation, memory, anticipation, im agin-<br>
ing, attention, learning, and affect. All this input is perceptual level. None of this <br>
perceptual-level processing constitutively includes cognitive elements in any sense of <br>
 ‘cognitive’ that counts cognition a higher-level type of representation than perception. <br>
Computational explanations of perceptual-level processing at these late stages omit supra-<br>
perceptual-level states, including propositional states, without inducing explanatory <br>
failure.<br>
<br>
The sense in which perceptual-level systems do not include cognitive elements is <i>not</i> <br>
that their processing is not, sometimes, causally affected in normal ways by cognitive <br>
elem ents. One should not think of psychological systems as causally hermetic. Chapters <br>
14–18 develop the idea that each of the listed generic capacities has a perceptual level as <br>
well as supra-perceptual, or cognitive, levels. For example, memory or attention com-<br>
mands are not monoliths. They have representational levels. There is interaction between <br>
levels. However, computations in perceptual psychology operate only on perceptual-level <br>
representations. This fact grounds taking them to be part of a system, which does not <br>
include supra-perceptual representation.<br>
<br>
Opponents of cognitive encapsulation or impenetrability rightly insist that perceptual <br>
processing is not as feed-forward, as the original proponents of encapsulation thought. <br>
They rightly take non-perceptual input, from memory and attention, to contribute to per-<br>
ceptual processes, such as some (but not all) instances of perceptual categorization. <br>
Opponents have rightly criticized some of Fodor and Pylyshyn’s claims about impenetra-<br>
bility, on natural understandings of the claims.<br>
<br>
However, both proponents and opponents tend to think of memory, anticipation, <br>
im agin ing, learning—and often attention initiations and conation—as monoliths. They <br>
tend to think of some or all of them as cognitive, full stop. For example, it is common to <br>
infer from perceptual processing as task oriented—influenced by conation—to its being <br>
cognitively penetrated. Since I think that the perceptual-level versions of these generic <br>
capacities occur inside the perceptual (or perceptual-motor) system, I reject thinking that <br>
they could penetrate it in any sense.<br>
<br>
Many on both sides of the penetration dispute show little reflection on what counts as <br>
cognition—the candidate “penetrator”. This neglect is mainly a philosophical failure. <br>
Attention, conation (often called ‘plans’), memory (often called ‘knowledge’), learning, <br>
anticipation (often called ‘prediction’), and imagining are counted cognition without <br><br>
