model non-demonstrative propositional reasoning with actual computational models for <br>
perceptual-level processes, the differences in success are dramatic.<br>
<br>
Different individuals have different beliefs, biases, interests, levels of intelligence, <br>
sources of information, and patience. Such factors make codifying reasoning in a compu-<br>
tational form exponentially more difficult than producing computational accounts of <br>
perceptual-level processes.<br>
<br>
Fodor emphasized the complexity of non-demonstrative reasoning, both theoretical <br>
and practical, in non-modular systems.1159 The huge variety of considerations that can be <br>
relevant, and that can bear on conclusions, in any given piece of non-demonstrative <br>
reason ing, has so far blocked computational codification.<br>
<br>
There are approximately true computational explanations of perceptual-level psy cho-<br>
logic al processes. There is no comparable computational explanation for non-<br>
demonstrative inferential processing among propositional attitudes.<br>
<br>
Fodor’s reaction to the situation was, I think, idiosyncratic and wayward. He took <br>
psych ology to provide no understanding where its computational explanations leave off. <br>
He thought that we have essentially no understanding of non-modular, central processing <br>
systems that involve non-demonstrative reasoning. Indeed, he conjectured that central <br>
systems are ‘bad candidates for scientific study’.1160 I think that this view crosses the border <br>
of the silly.<br>
<br>
Scientific explanation takes many forms. Some non-computational explanations in sci-<br>
ence are comparable to computational ones in the depth of understanding that they yield. <br>
Explanations in quantum mechanics and evolutionary biology are not computational. <br>
They provide different kinds of understanding of their subject matters. Explanations in <br>
geology, economics, and most psychology that does not deal with perceptual-level states <br>
are not computational. They offer less deep understanding than we would like. They some-<br>
times do, however, provide insight into significant patterns in the world. Non-<br>
computational psychology refines and systematizes common-sense explanation, extending <br>
it significantly. To be scientifically minded about psychology, indeed about science, is to be <br>
a pluralist about explanation.<br><br>

<b>FOOTNOTES</b><br>
<b>FN</b>1159 Fodor, <i>The Modularity of Mind</i>, part IV; Fodor, <i>The Mind Doesn’t Work That Way</i>, chapters 2–4. In these <br>
works, Fodor focuses on a few central problems for computational explanations of non-demonstrative reasoning. <br>
I think that, if anything, he understates the difficulties.<br>
Fodor sometimes makes his points in terms of confirmation rather than psychological processing—claiming <br>
that confirmation resists computational modeling. Confirmation is an epistemic matter. Fodor clearly believed <br>
that we often form beliefs in accord with epistemic norms, so he saw the two types of accounts as running along <br>
similar lines. See Fodor, <i>The Modularity of Mind</i>, 104–106. The epistemic formulations are, however, misleading. <br>
First, the practical aspects of computational psychology (for example, those aspects associated with motor com-<br>
mands and cost functions even in perceptual processing) are not analogous to confirmation. Second, although <br>
Fodor certainly knew that psychological explanation is not itself normative, as confirmation is, other philo-<br>
sophers have run the two together in ways that Fodor did not intend—taking epistemology to impose constraints <br>
on psychology. (See this chapter, the section The Cognitive Penetration Controversy.)<br>
Fodor emphasizes two features of confirmation that render non-demonstrative reasoning hard to codify in a <br>
computational model. One, which he calls ‘being isotrophic’, is that ‘the facts relevant to the confirmation of a <br>
scientific hypothesis may be drawn from anywhere in the field of previously established empirical (or, of course, <br>
demonstrative) truths’. The other, which he calls ‘Quinean’, is that ‘the degree of confirmation assigned to any <br>
given hypothesis is sensitive to properties of the entire belief system.’ Relevant properties are simplicity, plausibil-<br>
ity, and conservatism. These features figure in actual reasoning, not just confirmation. The quotes come from <br>
Fodor, <i>The Modularity of</i> <i>Mind</i>, 105 and 107, respectively. For the philosophical work on confirmation that Fodor <br>
is alluding to, see Quine, ‘Two Dogmas of Empiricism’; and H. Putnam, ‘The Analytic and the Synthetic’ (1962), in <br>
