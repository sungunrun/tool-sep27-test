Forms of Perceptual Attention 533</div>
<br><br>
Attention commands can occur when represented matters are selected in a representa-<br>
tional system. Attentional commands can be conceptual—as in the intention-in-action, <br>
Attend: solve the mathematical problem, or Attend: find an x-ray machine. Or they can be <br>
perceptual-level: Attend: that1 red cube. A conceptual command can cause a perceptual-<br>
level command and thereby cause perceptual attention. I believe that in any non-<br>
pathological case, however, a conceptual command can cause perceptual attention only by <br>
causing a perceptual-level attention command. The content of cognitive-level conative <br>
states must be translated into perceptual content in order to connect with the representa-<br>
tional states that receive the attention-boost, and to ground computational representation-<br>
alist explanation. This is another way of saying that to initiate perceptual attention in a <br>
normal, representational way, a conceptual attention command has its effect via <br>
perceptual-level representational capacities that control effects on perception. These per-<br>
ceptual representational capacities are controlled by perceptual-level attention commands. <br>
For example, the command must be structured in an iconic map-like format within which <br>
visual perception operates, if it is to connect with the perceptual capacities that it controls. <br>
(See Chapter 14, the section Form of Relatively Primitive Conative States <br>
for articulation of this point.) As we shall see, computational theories of perception, <br>
including perceptual attention, make no essential appeal to proposition-level states.<br>
<br>
Perceptual attention divides into three types: spatial attention, feature-based attention, <br>
and object-based attention.<br>
<br>
<i>Spatial attention</i>, by far the most studied, is selection of responses broadly by area. The <br>
area may be an area of retinotopic registration or an area of environmental space. There is <br>
gain in neural firing for a selected area. Spatial resolution is attenuated in surrounding <br>
areas, through suppression of neural firing. Spatial attention can be distributed over a <br>
larger or smaller area. If resources are allocated to improve spatial resolution over a larger <br>
area rather than focused, there is a proportionate loss of spatial resolution and processing <br>
efficiency for some sub-areas of the attended area.<br>
<br>
Perceptual-level spatial attention commands have the modality and form:<br><br>
Attend: (here-cego x1)LocL(c)(x2 , x1)<br><br>
(timing omitted), where LocL(c)(x2 , x1) maps an area, x2, relative to anchor x1 on the <br>
perceiver.<br>
<br>
Spatial attention can be <i>covert</i> or <i>overt</i>. It is covert if it occurs without eye movement. <br>
One can foveate one area, but attend peripherally. Spatial attention can also be directed <br>
overtly, through shifts in the direction in which the eyes point. Although covert attention is <br>
exploited in psychological experiments, and may seem special, it is actually ubiquitous in <br>
everyday life. Covert spatial attention (whether exogenous or endogenous) commonly pre-<br>
cedes saccades. It is a primary driver of where eyes come to be directed in the next saccade.<br>
<br>
Spatial attention can be <i>exogenous</i>, initiated by the present stimulus, or <i>endogenous</i>, initi-<br>
ated dominantly by antecedent internal factors.730 Exogenous attention is para dig mat ic al ly <br><br>
