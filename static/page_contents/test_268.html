How is this fact known? Perceived duration is distorted in various predictable ways so <br>
as to fail to match actual duration of events or intervals. Several factors cause such distor-<br>
tion. Speed, temporal frequency, level of attention, intention to perform an action, sac-<br>
cades, noise, and anticipation all cause illusions regarding the length of temporal intervals. <br>
For example, in repetitive showings of some type of event, the first perceived event is com-<br>
monly estimated to have a longer duration than the successive events. An “oddball” event <br>
that is different from others in a repeated series is represented as lasting longer than the <br>
other events with the same actual duration.265<br>
<br>
One upshot of work on temporal distortions in vision has been the suggestion of some <br>
surprising facts about perceptual representation via timing mechanisms. It has been <br>
shown that the perceived duration of an entity’s motion, in the sub-1-second range, can be <br>
reduced by motion adaptation. Repeated exposure to similar motion causes temporal <br>
intervals, during such motion, to be perceived as shorter. Such distortion occurs in <i>local</i> <br>
regions of the visual field. Perception of other changes going on at the same time in other <br>
areas of the visual field is not distorted. The distortions show that different timings that <br>
affect perception of duration of physical events are available for different spatial regions. <br>
Such experiments suggest that perceptual representation of time intervals may be frag-<br>
mented in distinct, sensory-modality-specific spatial patches.266<br>
<br>
Another upshot is the suggestion that specialized timing mechanisms occur at various <br>
stages along the pathway of perception-formation. This point is suggested by the range of <br>
sources of distortion. Those distortions associated with saccadic eye movements and ret-<br>
ino top ic adaptation suggest timing mechanisms that occur very early in the formation of <br>
perception. Those associated with attention and action suggest mechanisms that occur <br>
rather late. Both early and late mechanisms occur within a second of the onset of the <br>
stimulus.<br>
<br>
These points indicate that various “presents” are set in perception. Different presents <br>
are intervals, or onsets of intervals, that time events whose beginnings are perceived as <br>
occurring during the duration of a perceptual state.<br>
<br>
Further complexities loom. Some timing of very short events or intervals, in the <br>
50–300 ms range may not be mappable into a single linear scale. Timing in a perceptual <br>
modality may depend on the amount and type of neural activity that occurs at the onset of <br>
a distal stimulus to be timed. Such timing may discriminate intervals and determine <br><br>
