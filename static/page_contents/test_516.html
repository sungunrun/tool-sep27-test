516 Perceptual-Level Conation and Action</div>
<br><br>
To give some inkling of its richness, I discuss some roles of anticipatory representation <br>
in guiding relatively primitive action. To appreciate a role for proprioceptive anticipatory <br>
representation, consider this simple experiment. Reach out your hand with palm side <br>
upward. Place a moderately heavy object, say a large book, on your hand. Have someone <br>
pick up the book from your hand. Although you know your companion is about to pick <br>
up the book and you can monitor his or her action and anticipate the time when the book <br>
is to be lifted, you cannot keep your hand fully steady. Your hand moves up when the book <br>
is taken. Your hand exerts the upward pressure to support the book in the first moments <br>
<i>after</i> it has been taken. Replace the book on your palm and remove it yourself. When you <br>
take the book from the hand, your hand remains still.697<br>
<br>
The experiment evinces that proprioception contributes an anticipatory representation <br>
that helps guide your effort to hold the hand steady, and that this state differs from the <br>
state that anticipates your companion’s removing the book. While holding the book, your <br>
action system determines the pressure needed to support it because you have learned rela-<br>
tions between weights of similar books and pressure. Anticipatory timing of your com-<br>
panion’s book removal must rely on your visual system. There is a small delay in conversion <br>
of your visual representation, together with your anticipation, into motor commands that <br>
lead to your hand’s reducing upward pressure. When you anticipate your own removal of <br>
the book, you need not rely on visual representation of your removing the book from one <br>
hand, using the other. Proprioception anticipatorily represents the time of the lifting and <br>
the consequences of the lifting by one hand on the supporting effort needed to be exerted <br>
by the other hand. There is no delay through the visual system. So you can hold one hand <br>
steady when your other hand lifts the book. The proprioceptive system anticipates how <br>
motor commands to one body-part affect the states of other body-parts. Action guided by <br>
such anticipation is faster than action guided by vision and proprioception. Both actions <br>
depend on processing <i>representational</i> perceptual states and states of perceptual <br>
anticipation.<br>
<br>
The advantage of combining anticipatory representation, or forward models, with per-<br>
ceptions in generating action is at least three-fold.698 First, combining perception with <br>
anticipation improves speed. The foregoing case suggests this advantage. If one can act not <br>
just in response to perception, but in response to anticipation of an event, one can act <br>
more quickly. Second, anticipation improves accuracy. For example, anticipation improves <br>
perceptual accuracy in peripheral vision.699 Action errors are also corrected—for example, <br>
movements that would otherwise fall short of a target. Third, anticipatory representation <br>
supports motor and perceptual learning. Comparison of anticipation with a sensed out-<br>
come is a common basis for such learning. Anticipation also figures in learning that does <br><br>
