<br>
Evidence often cited for object-centered frameworks comes from unilateral neglect. <br>
Because of damage to the brain’s right hemisphere, some patients ignore the left sides of <br>
objects both when the objects are presented in the intact right field of vision and when <br>
they are rotated so that the object’s left half falls in the intact right visual field.252 Often <br>
these facts are taken to evince that there is a psychological coordinate system with up–<br>
down/left–right defined on the object itself.<br>
<br>
Other explanations have been proposed. For example, one type of egocentric view of an <br>
object might be psychologically privileged. Call this a canonical view. Rotated objects pre-<br>
sented in non-canonical orientations might be psychologically rotated back so as to match <br>
the egocentric canonical representation. The left half of the canonical representation is <br>
then ignored.253<br>
<br>
Other evidence for object-centered spatial frameworks, such as neural evidence, has <br>
also received alternative explanations.254 I do not take sides on the issue. For present pur-<br>
poses, I focus on the basic type of spatial frameworks—egocentric frameworks. I leave it <br>
to others to incorporate any allocentric frameworks into the semantical framework that <br>
I outline.<br><br>

<b>Egocentric Temporal Frameworks and Perceptual  <br>
<br>
Representation of Motion<br><br>
</div>
</b>Temporal representation in perception has received much less scientific attention than <br>
spatial representation. The last two decades have, however, witnessed a surge in timing <br>
studies. Issues raised in understanding perceptual temporal representational content are <br>
very complex. I sketch the surface of some of these complexities.<br>
<br>
Temporal representation in perception is omnipresent. It enters the form of perceptual <br>
representation in something like the way in which tense enters linguistic structure. A dif-<br>
ference is that perception is a “present” sense. It is thus limited to times and temporal <br>
spans that are, broadly speaking, “in the present”. But perception is coordinated with <br>
 perceptual memory and perceptual anticipation. Therein is the analogy to tenses in <br>
 language clearer.<br>
<br>
Although particulars are always perceived as they were at least micro-seconds before <br>
the perception, their occurrence is timed as present. This “present” is understood so as <br><br>
