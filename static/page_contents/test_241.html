The Form of Perceptual Attributives in Linkages 241</div>

transfer ways of thinking about primitives that derive from linguistic and conceptual sys-<br>
tems to perception.<br>
<br>
I call perceptual attributives that indicate an attribute that is the common <i>representatum</i> <br>
in a perceptual constancy <i>primitively linked</i> <i>attributives</i>. I conjecture that all perceptual <br>
attributives are linked to others in perceptual constancies. So primitivity for such at tribu-<br>
tives—primitivity that derives from their not being complexes of other perceptual at tribu-<br>
tives—always involves semantical connections to other perceptual attributives at the same <br>
level of abstraction.<br>
<br>
Even perceptual category-attributives like edge, surface, body, cat-body must be <br>
applied perceptually on the basis of other attributives—in these cases, spatial attribu-<br>
tives. Constancies involving category attributives depend on competence-links, and <br>
semantical links, to other attributives in their application bases. The categorizing attrib-<br>
utives inherit aspects of their modes of presentation and have a derivative representa-<br>
tional structure from the shape and size attributives in their application bases. <br>
Categorizing primitives involve extra competencies that distinguish them from the <br>
attributives in their application bases. For example, the disposition to anticipate continuity <br>
distinguishes attributives for <i>body</i> from the shape-size primitives that constitute their <br>
application bases. Still, at tribu tives for <i>body</i> differ from one another in inheriting the <br>
modes of presentations of the spatial-attributive application bases. Non-primitive <br>
 complexes of perceptual attributives are groups of packaged primitive ones, like straight <br>
edge of length L at orientation O.223<br>
<br>
There are, of course, other notions of primitivity. Some are associated with taxonomic <br>
hierarchies. For example, one can visually attribute <i>surface</i> and surface shape (set in 3-D <br>
space) without attributing <i>body</i> or 3-D volume shape, but probably not vice-versa. See <br>
Chapter 4, the section Taxonomic Hierarchies in Perception. I leave exploring <br>
notions of perceptual primitivity to others.<br><br>

<b>The Form of Perceptual Attributives in Linkages<br><br>
</div>
</b>Linkage of different perceptual attributives forces refinement in how I have presented the <br>
form of perceptual attributions. Until now, our form for that brown cubical body has been:<br><br>
(that x1)[(that x2)(that x3)(brown(c)(x1), brown(i)(x2), cubical(c)(x1), cubical(i)(x3), body(i)(x1))].<br><br>
The presentation omits the perspectival way in which a given attribute is represented. <br>
Different kinds of perceptual states, with different representational contents, represent an <br>
attribute via different modes of presentation. The different contents are different psycho-<br>
logical kinds linked in indicating and attributing a single attribute.<br>
<br>
These facts induce further structure in attributives. Each attributive for <i>cubical</i> repre-<br>
sents the shape differently. Differences derive from different sizes, distances, orientations, <br>
and so on. Of course, generic attributives for <i>body</i> are always applied on the basis of <br>
generic shape. Generic shape is presented differently on different occasions—via specific <br>
shapes and sizes and always from a specific depth and orientation perspective. Let us focus <br><br>
