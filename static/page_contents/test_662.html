662 Perception and Cognition</div>

The issue here is not mainly whether these claims hold. When Pylyshyn wrote, he fol-<br>
lowed an important thread in mainstream science. Presently, his claims can safely be <br>
regarded as wrong. The present issue is rather that his views set the terms for the discus-<br>
sion of penetration that followed. The primary issues lie in understanding perceptual <br>
states, in understanding psychological kinds with which perception interacts, in under-<br>
standing what is reasonably called ‘cognition’, and in understanding what counts as <br>
penetration.<br><br>

<b>Uses and Misuses of the Term ‘Cognition’<br><br>
</div>
</b>Recall some points, from Chapter 13, the section Framing a Dispute and this chap-<br>
ter’s introduction, about uses of the term ‘cognition’. I sharply distinguish my use from two <br>
others common in psychology. The first and broadest one takes the term to apply to any <br>
sort of representation. Thus perception is taken to be a <i>species</i>  of cognition. This use takes <br>
perceptual psychology to be a <i>sub-discipline</i> of cognitive psychology. It was this use that <br>
figured in differentiating behaviorism from mentalistic—representational—psych-<br>
ology.1076 The use is often explicated as all acts and processes involved in acquisition, stor-<br>
age, retrieval, and processing of information. Of course, the explication conflates <br>
information registration and representation. The second use applies ‘cognition’ to all types <br>
of representation except for “early” perceptual representation—perception as of colors, <br>
shapes, motion, and the like. This use counts categorization as cognition, <i>without any <br>
implication that such cognition is not perceptual, even purely perceptual</i>. This use takes some <br>
perceptual states to be “cognition”, but not others.<br>
<br>
These uses of ‘cognition’, which do not assume a boundary between cognition and per-<br>
ception, differ from my use. The difference is non-substantive. However, I see these two <br>
uses as lacking current fruitful motivation. They hinder clear thinking about psy cho-<br>
logic al kinds.<br>
<br>
As indicated last section, a few writers in disputes over cognitive penetration deny a <br>
distinction between perception and cognition. They argue the view. They do not assume it <br>
as a consequence of their usage. Again, I do not take this position seriously. The differ-<br>
ences in representational structure between perceptual representation and paradigms of <br>
cognitive representation—propositional states—consist in differences in representational <br>
competencies that are fundamental, and empirically obvious.<br>
<br>
Most participants in disputes over cognitive penetration assume some distinction <br>
between perception and cognition, but try to find the boundary.1077 My use of ‘cognition’ <br>
accords with this assumption. On this use, perceptual states and cognitive states are dis-<br>
joint. I am interested in uses of ‘cognition’ that mark a psychological kind, or kinds, that <br>
differ from the kinds <i>perception</i> and <i>perceptual-level state.</i> Propositional states and pro-<br>
cesses are central cases of cognition. I do not <i>assume</i> that cognition comprises only prop-<br>
os ition al states and processes.<br><br>
