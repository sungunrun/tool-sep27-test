154 PercePtual reference requires PercePtual attribution</div>
<br><br>
Laying aside the issue of successful reference, Schellenberg’s idea that a perception <br>
could contain no attributives is supported by no argument at all. There is no argument <br>
that the structure of perceptual representation does not constitutively involve attribution <br>
to particulars. The science of perceptual psychology is almost entirely occupied with <br>
accounting for the formation of attributive representations in perception.<br>
<br>
The conclusion of Schellenberg’s argument is not clearly stated. She writes, ‘what ul tim-<br>
ate ly guides perceptual representation is not attribution of general features, but rather <br>
something more fundamental’. What is this more fundamental “something”?<br><br>
In contrast to Burge, I am arguing that the property-instances that we perceive are par-<br>
<br>
ticulars: The general elements in perceptual experience are the perceptual capacities <br>
<br>
employed not attributive representational contents as Burge has it. So while Burge argues <br>
<br>
that we attribute general properties to objects and events in our environment, I am argu-<br>
<br>
ing that we employ general perceptual capacities by means of which we single out par-<br>
<br>
ticulars, such as property-instances, objects, and events. (See note 162 again).<br><br>
As indicated, there is no contrast with my view in the assertion that we perceive property-<br>
instances (which are particulars). So any contrast would have to lie in the claim that ‘the <br>
general elements in perceptual experience are the perceptual capacities employed—not <br>
attributive representational contents’ (see note 162 again). This statement, too, is confused. <br>
Attributive representational contents just <i>are</i> repeatable perceptual capacities employed in <br>
perceiving particulars, partly by means of which we single out particulars.169 Schellenberg <br>
intends to mark a contrast with my view. She opposes my view that ‘singular context-<br>
bound perceptual representations must be guided by general attributive representational <br>
contents’ (see note 162 again). This opposition is opposition to (AA1), and by implication <br>
(AA2). The upshot of her reasoning is not what she announces it to be. It simply calls for <br>
‘general perceptual capacities by means of which we single out particulars’ (see note 162 <br>
again). There is no specification of what these general perceptual capacities are. In fact, they <br>
are attributive capacities. The argument does not try to show that they are not. So the <br>
argument does not even have the form of supporting the announced conclusion—op pos-<br>
ition to (AA1) and (AA2).170<br><br>

<b>FOOTNOTES</b><br>
<b>Cont FN</b>169 There are also the schematic general perceptual capacities, marked by that. These clearly do not suffice to <br>
single out particulars. Appealing to them could not explain singling out particulars. They constitute what needs <br>
to be explained. Perceptual psychology would not dream of explaining perception <i>purely</i> by appeal to a generic <br>
competence, that, to single out particulars.<br>
170 Schellenberg describes her positive view, semantic particularism, thusly: ‘If a subject S perceives particular <br>
<i>a</i>, then S’s perceptual state M is constituted by <i>a</i>’. Schellenberg, ‘Perceptual Particularity’, 47. Even apart from the <br>
strange view that a perceptual state can be constituted (even partly constituted) by a particular in the en vir on-<br>
ment, I find ‘constituted by’ unclear. The type of constitution is not specified. She appears to intend a perceived <br>
entity to be a constituent in the content of the perceptual state. I think that psychological competencies, or exer-<br>
cises of competencies, are semantic contents. They are the basic constituents. Schellenberg takes ‘constituted’, in <br>
her formulation of semantic particularism, to allow partial constitution: Schellenberg, ‘Perceptual Particularity’, <br>
26. She does not specify what more there is to the constitution of a perceptual state beyond a perceived particular.<br>
I pass over cases in which a subject has a perceptual state but has a referential illusion as of a particular; so no <br>
particular is perceived. In cases of successful perception of a particular, it is not the perceived particular <i>a</i>, but <br>
the occurrent referential application event that picks out <i>a</i> that is (partly) constitutive of the perceptual state and <br>
its representational content. I follow perceptual psychology and common sense in taking only entities in a mind <br>
or psychology to be parts of or aspects of a perceptual state. Perceived particulars are not entities in an individu-<br>
al’s mind or psychology. Perceived particulars are in a sense semantically coded by a perceptual state. (<i>cont.</i>) </div>
