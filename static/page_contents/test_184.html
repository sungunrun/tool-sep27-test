184  Form and Semantics of Perceptual Contents</div>
<br><br>
I use different occurrences of the noun phrase ‘that body’, understood in the context to <br>
be applied to different bodies. The noun phrases refer independently of one another. The <br>
order of the widest-scope referential applications is interchangeable. It can be commuted <br>
without altering the kind of psychological state, individuated by the representational con-<br>
tent. The order is also irrelevant to the accuracy condition set by the representational con-<br>
tent. The order of the attributions of the attributive body to the particulars purportedly <br>
singled out by those applications is interchangeable. These orders are psychologically and <br>
representationally insignificant.<br>
<br>
Although there are, perhaps, many such cases of scope-equality, issues over relative <br>
width of scope among referential applications naturally arise. Of two equidistant bodies, <br>
one might be more the focus of attention than the other.<br>
<br>
Suppose that one tiger appears more tense and threatening than the other. One per cep-<br>
tual ly attends to the tiger marked by referential application 1 more than to the other tiger. <br>
Then the difference should be marked in the representational form:<br><br>
(ego-here x0)(that x1)[(that x2)(equi-distant(c)(x1, x2, x0), body(i)(x1), body(i)(x2))].<br><br>
In English, the difference can be marked by tonal emphasis, or by ordering: ‘that1 tiger <br>
equidistant with that2 tiger from here0’. The scope may mark a life and death difference in <br>
this psychological state from a state that distributes attention equally or attends to the <br>
non-threatening tiger.<br>
<br>
In perception, scope differences are grounded in psychological reality, not linguistic cus-<br>
tom. Of course, if one tiger does look tensed and the other looks relaxed, different accuracy <br>
conditions are set in perception of the different tigers. Then the difference between the two <br>
referential applications is not merely one of scope, but also one of attribution (mode of <br>
presentation), and even of accuracy condition. Different attributives for the same indicant <br>
with different modes of presentations set different accuracy conditions, even if the accuracy <br>
conditions are fulfilled by the same conditions in the world. Differences in psychological <br>
priority and differences in attribution or accuracy condition constitute different aspects of a <br>
psychological state. In principle, scope differences—marking psychological priority—can <br>
attend different perceptual references, even if the other types of differences do not do so.<br>
<br>
In natural-language quantified structures, a narrower-scope quantification is some-<br>
times dependent on, and selected relative to, a wider-scope quantification. In the ambigu-<br>
ous sentence,<br><br>
Every man standing to the left of a woman is wearing glasses,<br><br>
the natural reading is that the selection of a woman is dependent on the prior selection of <br>
a man. On this reading, the quantifier ‘a woman’ is scope-dependent on, narrower-scope <br>
than, the quantifier ‘every man’. The choice of woman can vary with the choice of man.<br>
<br>
Scope hierarchy among referential applications in noun-phrase-like structures, in language <br>
and perception, can have a similar ground. Sometimes, unlike the case of the simultaneous <br>
perception of the tigers where one tiger is focal, scope priority hinges on dynamic matters. If <br>
one referential application is a reference point, and the other is psychologically dependent on <br>
that reference point, the scope of the first referential application has wider scope.</div>
