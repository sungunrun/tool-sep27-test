em pir ic al conjecture, I assume here that these smallest perceptually discernible, pixel-like <br>
units are representationally indivisible. On this assumption, we do <i>not</i> perceive <i>as</i>  parts <br>
<i>overlaps</i> among smallest perceptual discernible pixel-like units—overlaps that include a <br>
sub-part of one pixel-like entity and one or more sub-parts of others, where the overlap <br>
remains the size of a smallest perceptually discernible unit. The idea is that there are nat-<br>
ural “pixel-like” units that are determined by neural activity. This simplifying assumption <br>
is, of course, open to empirical refinement or rejection.<br>
<br>
We perceive <i>as</i> <i>parts</i> of a natural-unit edge, surface, or body, some <i>combinations</i> of <br>
these smallest perceptually discernible units. I think that there are contiguity restrictions <br>
on what sub-parts of a natural-unit entity we perceive <i>as</i> <i>parts</i> of it. Most Goodmanian <br>
parts are not perceived <i>as parts</i> of anything, even natural units. This too is an empirical <br>
conjecture. I think it very likely that our visual systems do not group arbitrary scattered <br>
parts of an edge or surface as parts of the edge or surface. Scattered parts are different <br>
parts. I allude to restrictions on this point below.<br>
<br>
So, as a first approximation—except for smallest discernible parts—in close-up, easily <br>
viewed perceptual <i>representata</i>, every visually represented part of a natural segmented <br>
unit (for example, a natural edge unit that is perceived as having natural endpoints or <br>
boundaries or a natural surface unit whose outer boundaries are perceptually salient) is <br>
contiguous to some other part of the part. (See the exception cited in note 364.) There are <br>
smallest visible parts that lack visible parts. There is a level of grain below which vision <br>
does not go. Like smallest visible parts, intermediate-sized visible parts, perceived as parts <br>
of larger natural units, can lack visible boundaries. They are seen and seen as parts, but not <br>
seen as having boundaries—as having natural endpoints or edges.<br>
<br>
Seeing is referentially successful visual perception. Visual reference has the structure <br>
of occurrent, successful referential application of attributives that guide the application. <br>
At least one guiding attributive must be accurate of a seen entity. For every different seen <br>
entity, the visual system must attribute a different attributive or different attributives. The <br>
different attributives may or may not be accurate of the perceived entity, as long as some <br>
one-place “categorizing” attributive is accurate of it. (See Chapter 5.) So when an individ-<br>
ual sees a natural-unit, perceptually delimited edge, surface, or body, each seen sub-part of <br>
the natural unit is represented by a referential application guided by attributives that meet <br>
the just-stated conditions.<br>
<br>
To illustrate how semantically complex part–whole iconic perception is, imagine a small <br>
surface, <i>S</i>, that is perceived, unobstructed, as a natural edge-bounded surface. Take the six <br>
cells to be smallest discernible sub-parts of <i>S</i>, and take them to be perceived. See Figure 9.1.<br><br>
