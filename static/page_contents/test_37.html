Three Basic Representational Constituents 37</div>

that functions to rely on an occurrent, context-bound causal relation to a particular. The <br>
causal relation is necessary to single out a particular. The perceived particular causes some <br>
aspect of the perceptual state that constitutes a perception of the particular.<br>
<br>
Different perceptions, even of the same particular, are different events. So the picking <br>
out of a particular is an occurrent, context-bound event. It is an event that occurs on a <br>
particular occasion, in a particular perceptual system, at a particular time. There is there-<br>
fore an element in the structure of the representational content—a referential element—<br>
that is an occurrent, non-repeatable event or an instantiated aspect of the state. This event <br>
is the exercise of the picking-out competence on a particular occasion. The competence <br>
functions to be caused by a particular <i>representatum</i>, and to thereby pick out that <br>
particular.<br>
<br>
Again, picking out a particular partly depends on an event that consists in the par-<br>
ticular’s causing the perceptual state. The psychological effect of the cause is itself an <br>
event, or an instantiated aspect of an instantiated perceptual state. If that event in the <br>
perceiver’s psychology occurs in the exercise of a perceptual competence, it has the rep-<br>
resentational function of referring, proto-typically in a singular way. The event that <br>
functions to pick out the particular is itself an occurrent exercise of a specific perceptual <br>
competence. I call such exercises <i>occurrence­ based</i>. They are occurrence-based in that <br>
their identities depend on an occurrent event—one that is specific to a place (or indi-<br>
vidual mind) and time. I call occurrence-based perceptual constituents that function to <br>
refer—that function to be the representational elements that pick out particulars in per-<br>
ceiving them—‘<i>perceptual referential applications</i>’. Because referential applications con-<br>
tribute to the accuracy conditions of a perceptual state, they are representations— <br>
instantiations of representational contents. Indeed, referential applications are inevitable <br>
components in the representational content of every perceptual state. So they <i>are</i> repre-<br>
sentational contents. In perception, they exercise the first form of reference by represen-<br>
tational mind.34<br>
<br>
These application events are referential not in that they always succeed in referring, but <br>
in that their representational function is to refer—to pick out something. A perceptual <br>
referential application may or may not succeed in referring. When a referential application <br>
spearheads perception of something, the referring is always to a particular—a non-<br>
repeatable entity—in space and time. These application events are perceptual in that they <br>
are exercises, applications, of perceptual competencies. Conceptual referential applica-<br>
tions play a similar role in context-dependent, propositional thought.<br>
<br>
Referential applications differ functionally from <i>attributional applications</i>. Attributional <br>
applications are occurrent instances of attribution, successful or not. (I discuss attributives <br>
later in this section.) If I do not qualify ‘application’, context will usually indicate that I <br>
intend referential application. Both types of application are individuated in terms of <br>
occurrent events, not types.<br>
<br>
Attributional applications in perception are effected by referential applications. That is, <br>
attributions in perceptual states always occur via referential applications of attributives. <br><br>

<b>FOOTNOTES</b><br>
<b>Cont FN</b>34 I discussed referential applications very early in my work—in ‘Belief <i>De Re</i>’, even using the term ‘applica-<br>
tion’. The term did not become a technical term for me, however, until the early 1980s. Referential applications <br>
are non-conceptual elements in thought and non-attributional occurrent elements in perception. My notion was <br>
inspired by the Kantian notion of intuition.</div>
