A Computational Construal of Modularity 705</div>

in the last two or three decades (see Chapters 10–12). Conceptual attributives <br>
remain absent.<br>
<br>
What is more, there is currently no evidence that computational explanations <i>need</i> to <br>
appeal to propositional-level elements in the computations in order to give rigorous com-<br>
putational explanations of their <i>explananda</i>—the perceptual states, motor commands, or <br>
actions. The massive literature that argues for cognitive penetration has not even tried to <br>
show anything deficient in the explanations already present for the very phenomena that <br>
that literature is concerned with: perceptual processing, task orientation, attention, and so <br>
on. Scientific explanations in the field are untouched by citations of causal influence <br>
between uncontroversial cognitive states (propositional-level states) and perceptual-level <br>
processes.<br>
<br>
Propositional attitudes do affect attention in principled ways. Perceptual attention—<br>
both attention commands and attention effects—<i>are</i> part of a computational system. Even <br>
so, when propositional attitudes “drive” the attention, they are not part of a computational <br>
system. At least, they are omitted from computational explanations in psychophysics. No <br>
evidence has been cited to show that they need to be included. Computational explanation <br>
begins with visual input and includes perceptual-level attention commands and their <br>
effects. It can do so whether or not they are “cognitively driven”. Computational ex plan-<br>
ation of the formation of a perceptual state does not and apparently need not cite any <br>
propositional attitudes that caused the attention command. As long as the perceptual-level <br>
attention command (containing perceptual attributives) occurs, and the perceptual-level <br>
sets and input are the same, a perceptual state is computed—regardless of <i>what</i> prop os-<br>
ition al attitudes caused the attention command, and <i>whether</i> any such attitudes did so.<br>
<br>
Of course, in the normal run of things, if there were a different antecedent conceptual <br>
driving command, the perceptual-level attention command would be different. But in <br>
principle there could be a disconnect between propositional-level cause and perceptual-<br>
level attention command, so that the former does cause the latter, but in a non-standard, <br>
non “sense-making” way. Even in this case, <i>if</i> the perceptual-level attention command <br>
occurs, the computation goes through. And certainly perceptual-level attention com-<br>
mands can occur without any antecedent cognitive driver. Computational explanation <br>
does not and need not distinguish among these cases.<br>
<br>
Similarly, for the relation between propositional-level intentions and perceptual-level <br>
motor commands that figure in eye movement, in motion constancy, and in object-<br>
position constancy. Computational explanations cite motor commands, corollary dis-<br>
charge, and other perceptual-level or lower-level states. Propositional states, including <br>
propositional-level intentions that may or may not cause the motor commands, are omit-<br>
ted. The computations work in the same way regardless of what propositional attitudes <br>
caused a motor command, and regardless of whether any did so.<br>
<br>
So although the computational systems are open to causal influence from propositional <br>
states, the influence seems not to be computational. The influence can affect what <br>
perceptual-level states are inputs into computations. But the perceptual-level states suffice, <br>
together with the initial state of the system and the laws governing operations on input, to <br>
produce a determinate output—a specific perceptual state or motor command, for <br>
ex ample. In this sense, perceptual-motor systems are computationally closed. I take this to <br>
be a <i>de facto</i> explanatory situation, not one that <i>could not</i> change. Still, the <i>de facto</i> situ-<br>
ation is remarkable and, I think, important.</div>
