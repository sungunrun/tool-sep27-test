Richer Perceptual Categorization and Its Processing 495</div>

not discuss this view in detail. I think it lightheaded. There are obvious differences in rep-<br>
resentational form, function, and capacity between perceptual states and propositional <br>
attitudes, the paradigms of cognition.<br>
<br>
I focus here on two, more prevalent misconceptions. One is that if a representational <br>
state is not a perceptual state, it is a cognitive state. On this view, motor and attention com-<br>
mands, memories, and anticipations—especially working memory and long-term mem-<br>
ory—, affect, imaginings, and learning are cognitive states or processes. So when perceptual <br>
categorizations are affected by them—even in the second stage of perceptual processing, <br>
after 150 ms—perceptual processing is taken to be a mix of perceptual and supra-<br>
perceptual-cognitive states. So the resulting categorizations are not more perceptual than <br>
cognitive. And, on this view, the idea of a <i>perceptual system</i>, or <i>perceptual-motor system</i>, <br>
governed by perceptual processing—after the first 150 ms of processing is dubious—or at <br>
any rate, not a natural kind marked by perception and perceptual-level processing.<br>
<br>
An even more prevalent misconception is the idea that the notion of <i>perceptual system</i> <br>
(or <i>perceptual-motor system</i>) depends on there being a system that is immune to causal <br>
influence by cognitive states. It is observed that through memory or attention, at least, <br>
propositional states—the paradigms of cognitive states—can have causal influence not <br>
only on initial settings but on perceptual processing as it occurs. It is concluded that if <br>
there is a real perceptual system, it is confined to early stages of perceptual processing, <br>
ending when there is feedback into processing that refines initial perceptual cat egor iza-<br>
tion. For this feedback is taken, either sometimes or nearly always, to include causal influ-<br>
ence by propositional attitudes.<br>
<br>
The rest of this chapter, Chapters 14–18, and Chapter 19, the section Uses and <br>
Misuses of the Term ‘Cognition’, mainly targets the first of these two misconcep-<br>
tions. A central aim is to show the listed capacities that are not perception—conation, <br>
attention command, memory, anticipation, affect, imagery, and learning—are genera, with <br>
sub-species that are on the representational level of perception. (Recall the explication of <br>
representational <i>level</i> from Chapter 1, the section Principal Aims of the Book and <br>
the initial paragraphs of this Chapter.) Perceptual-level exercises of these capacities occur <br>
in the perceptual system or perceptual-motor system. Computational transformations in <br>
these systems operate on such perceptual-level states as well as on perceptual states <br>
themselves.<br>
<br>
So, for example, when, in the later stages of perceptual processing, initial perceptual <br>
categorizations are refined by inputs from memory, the inputs are perceptual-level. There <br>
is no direct inference from such interaction that perception is interacting with cognition. <br>
For the relevant memory states are not cognitive, and not conceptual. They are perceptual-<br>
level. Thinking in terms of states at the level of perception rather than purely about per-<br>
ceptual states prepares the way for thinking of a perceptual system, or perceptual-motor <br>
system, as pure—as perceptual level.<br>
<br>
In Chapter 19, I return to the second misconception—the view that where perceptual <br>
processing is causally influenced (“penetrated”) by cognitive states, the notion of a percep-<br>
tual system is at best attenuated. I propose a different conception of perceptual system <br>
(and perceptual-motor system) that does not focus on immunity to mere causal influence <br>
or causal penetration. The idea is that perceptual-level states are integrated in a computa-<br>
tional system. Although cognitive states—even conceptual/propositional states—can caus-<br>
ally influence the system’s processes, they do so from the outside. They are not elem ents in, </div>
