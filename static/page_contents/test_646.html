perceptual rotation constancies. When similarity cues provide easy matching between dif-<br>
ferent viewpoints, the system may skip rotation and make a more direct match.1042<br>
<br>
On all these theories, operations in imagining and perceiving are parallel. The timing <br>
results suggest that similar operations work at different time scales, and different levels of <br>
endogenous control. Neither rotation, nor comparison by a similarity metric to a tem-<br>
plate, nor shape-determination paced, temporally, by degree of statistics-based confidence <br>
is a supra-perceptual operation. Operations in perceptual imagining appear to be similar <br>
to operations in perception. No wonder. The contents of imagining are derived from per-<br>
ception. It is not surprising that the operations also derive from perception. Shepard him-<br>
self regarded mental rotation as a relatively straightforward extension of perceptual <br>
capacities, not a “higher” capacity.1043<br>
<br>
As with some types of short-term memory, formation and control of images are sup-<br>
ported in brain areas that overlap areas that support vision. This point is less important <br>
than the points about form, format, type of processing, and content, in determining <br>
whether relevant imagining is perceptual-level or supra-perceptual. The neural evidence <br>
is, however, congenial with the idea that visual imagining is not a type of representation on <br>
the other side from perception of a deep divide among psychological kinds.1044 Of course, <br>
imagining is a genus with perceptual-level and supra-perceptual level species. However, <br>
imagining <i>per</i> <i>se</i> is not a form of cognition.<br><br>
