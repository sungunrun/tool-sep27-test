between height on a musical staff and high or low auditory pitch can be utilized in an <br>

There is probably no sharp distinction that marks natural sensitivity to natural relations <br>
in iconic representation or registration. A sufficient condition for a natural sensitivity is <br>
that an individual systematically associates a non-representational aspect of the repre-<br>
sentational content, representation, or registrational state without heavy training or <br>
adaptation.<br>
<br>
Such a condition gets at whether the association <i>comes naturally</i>. The condition is not a <br>
necessary condition, for one can come into an iconic mapping, and use it in sensory regis-<br>
tra tion or perception, through association. Moreover, natural sensitivity can be acquired <br>
through training. What comes naturally to a mathematician or chess player does not come <br>
naturally to a novice. The key point is that the association is not the same as any represen-<br>
tational relation between the representational contents, on one hand, and the represented <br>
subject matter, on the other.<br>
<br>
Simplest natural mappings occur between <i>like</i> dimensions, scales, or spectra. For <br>
ex ample, geometrical relations in a physical map correlate naturally with geometrical rela-<br>
tions in physical space. Color chits correlate with colors of the same type.<br>
<br>
Cross-dimensional correlations can also be natural. The intensity of light naturally cor-<br>
rel ates with the loudness of sound. A high bar on a graph correlates naturally with high <br>
gas pressure. Greater size correlates with greater intensity.<br>
<br>
In conditions (1)–(3) I explicated iconic representation partly in terms of non-<br>
representational natural mappings from <i>either</i> representational contents <i>or</i> representa-<br>
tions and a subject-matter domain. Representations are instances of representational <br>
contents. In the case of iconic pictures or photographs, representations are the physical <br>
vehicles of representation—the material pictures or photographs. The examples of iconic <br>
representation that I have cited are intuitively examples of iconic representations, not—or <br>
not obviously—iconic representational contents. Yet I am interested in iconic representa-<br>
tion fundamentally because I think that <i>representational contents</i> of perceptual states and <br>
other psychological states are iconic. Being iconic is an important aspect of the mode <br>
of presentation, and the nature of the accuracy conditions, of the relevant psy cho-<br>
logic al states.<br>
<br>
Representational contents are kinds of psychological states. To be iconic, they must <br>
have non-representational aspects. For what makes them iconic is use of aspects of the <br>
states that bear natural relations to aspects of the environment.<br>
<br>
The principal iconic elements in iconic representational contents are the attributives. <br>
Referential applications are not in themselves iconic, but in perception they are deriva-<br>
tively iconic. They bear natural mapping relations—through their associations with their <br>
guiding attributives. I think that all attributives in visual perception are iconic. For <br>
ex ample, color applies only through more specific color attributives that match a color <br>
spectrum in natural ways; body applies only through shape attributives that bear 1–1 <br>
mapping relations that are topographical natural. The mode of presentation of a given <br>
body attributive in perception is that of the corresponding shape and size attributives, plus <br>
the anticipation of continuity, and perhaps solidity.<br>
<br>
It is perhaps helpful to think of applications in vision as analogous to occurrences of the <br>
spatially arranged matches, which iconically represent the spatial arrangement of the <br>
tanks. Although the matches that represent the tanks may not themselves be iconic with </div>
