Structure of Conation in Relatively Primitive Action 519</div>

Subjects are not completely oblivious to details of operations in their motor systems. <br>
Consciousness bears complex relations to motor activity. For example, subjects were asked <br>
to point to a target’s position shortly after the target disappeared, without being allowed to <br>
monitor their pointing movement visually. Given noise in the system, such pointings are <br>
usually off-target. The subjects were asked to assess the accuracy of their pointings. <br>
Surprisingly, they could identify their errors and the rough direction of individual errors <br>
(for example, left or right of the target). Yet, lacking visual feedback during the pointing <br>
movements, they could not correct for errors that they had this knowledge of, even if their <br>
pointing movements were allowed to be very slow.709<br>
<br>
Conscious learning and natural unconscious adaptive learning occur in different ways <br>
and at different rates. Adaptive motor learning occurs at the same psychological level as <br>
perceptual learning, which I discuss in Chapter 18, the section Perceptual Learning. <br>
I give two examples.<br>
<br>
Subjects were trained on some objects whose weight varied inversely with their size. <br>
Subjects lifted such objects hundreds of times a day for twelve days. After the first day, <br>
subjects were given a small and a large object, which weighed the same. The subjects <br>
reported that the smaller object weighed more. This illusion was due to prior anticipation <br>
that the larger object would feel heavier. After some days of lifting, the illusion disap-<br>
peared. By the eleventh day, the judgments had reversed direction. Subjects reported the <br>
larger object to weigh more.<br>
<br>
The motor system responded to these circumstances differently from the way the sub-<br>
jects responded in their judgments. On the first day’s first trial, the subjects produced <br>
stronger lift force for larger objects. On the first day’s eighth trial, the lift force increased <br>
markedly. On the second day’s first trial, the motor system was producing a larger force for <br>
small objects than for larger objects. The motor system thus adapted to the unusual size-<br>
weight relations in relatively few trials.<br>
<br>
Both conscious perceptual judgment and the unconscious motor system initially antici-<br>
pated that weight increased with volume. Conscious judgment anticipation changed more <br>
slowly, taking eleven days to reverse. The two psychological capacities seem to follow dif-<br>
ferent adaptation schedules.710 Exactly how to characterize the two capacities is unclear.711<br><br>

are two <i>perceptual</i> <i>systems—</i>one associated with the dorsal stream and specialized to serve action, the other asso-<br>
ciated with the ventral stream and specialized to serve identification or recognition. See Shadmehr and Mussa-<br>

A cloud of doubt continues to hover over the idea that there are two fundamentally different <i>perceptual sys-<br>
tems</i> specialized for action and identification, respectively—despite the fact that there are unquestionably two <br>
anatomical streams that are relatively specialized in the processing that they support. For an updated version of <br>
the Goodale–Milner hypothesis, which gives up some of the original proposal’s more dramatic claims (such as <br>
that there is a ventral-stream illusion in a single Ebbinghaus display that is not matched by a dorsal-stream <br>
illusion), see D. Westwood and M. Goodale, ‘Converging Evidence for Diverging Pathways: Neuropsychology <br>
and Psychophysics Tell the Same Story’, <i>Vision Research</i> 51 (2011), 804–811; and M. Goodale, ‘Duplex Vision: <br>

evidence that the hypothesis is supposed to be grounded upon, see V. Franz, ‘Manual Size Estimation: <br>
