170  Form and Semantics of Perceptual Contents</div>
<br><br>
One could not visually perceive a body, and perceive no shape at all. One must ac cur-<br>
ate ly perceive and attribute at least the generic shape, <i>connected outer boundary</i>, in order to <br>
visually perceive a body. One could, however, attribute both generic shape and <i>body</i> <br>
and fail to perceive instances of either, while accurately perceiving the specific color of <br>
some gas.<br>
<br>
Most failures of perceptual accuracy do not come from referential failure. A referential <br>
application could secure a referent. The application’s accompanying attributive could fail <br>
to be veridical of the referent. An example is misperception of a surface of a puff of vapor <br>
as a body. Then the referential application that is accompanied by the perceptual at tribu-<br>
tive body would refer to the puff-surface, and the attributive body would mischaracterize <br>
it (not be accurate of it). The same sort of case might occur with the specific color or shape <br>
attributive. One might perceive a color of the body, but misperceive it as brown. Or one <br>
might perceive the shape-instance of the body, veridically perceive the specific shape as <br>
also an instance the generic shape of having a connected outer boundary, but misperceive <br>
that specific shape-instance as cubical.<br>
<br>
Although I focus here on referential applications in perception, such applications often <br>
establish files in perceptual memory. A file in perceptual, or propositional, memory based <br>
on perception, is a tracer of a perceptual referential application. The connection can be <br>
anaphoric, in which case the file contains an occurrence of the same referential applica-<br>
tion that occurred in a perception. More frequently, a file’s referential application is not <br>
fixed as that of a single referential application in an antecedent perceptual state. Two refer-<br>
ential applications, stemming from successive perceptions, can contribute to one tracking <br>
file in memory, if the two referential applications function fallibly to pick out the same <br>
particular, in tracking, and succeed. Most tracking is fallible. A file can be a locus of infor-<br>
mation gathering. A memory system can add or shed attributives that are attributively <br>
applied to the purported referent of the file. I return to these issues in Chapter 7, the sec-<br>
tion Referential Applications in Accuracy Conditions for Tracking <br>
Particulars.<br>
<br>
Let us return to the attributive aspects of the representational content that we have been <br>
discussing. As noted, two of the perceptual attributives make more than one attribution of <br>
their (purportedly) indicated attributive. For example, the perceptual attributive brown <br>
attributes the property <i>brown</i> not only to a purportedly perceived color-instance <br>
(an instance of the property <i>brown</i>), but also to a purportedly perceived body (an instance <br>
of the kind <i>body</i>).<br>
<br>
When an attributive is referentially applied successfully to an instance of its indicated <br>
attributive, I say that the attributive <i>betokens</i> that instance. Then the referential application, <br>
when successful, refers to the same thing that the accompanying attributive betokens. In our <br>
example, the referential application (that x2) refers to what the attributive brown betokens. <br>
Brown <i>indicates</i> the attribute-type, the property <i>brown</i> or brownness. In the given case, it <br>
betokens the attribute-instance, the particular trope of brownness. If the referential appli-<br>
cation refers to a color-instance that is not an instance of brown, or if it fails to refer to any <br>
color-instance in the context, the attributive brown does not betoken anything. The attributive <br>
still indicates the attribute-type, <i>brown</i>. Success in betokening requires referential <br>
 application to an instance of the indicated type. Such application depends on a contextually <br>
caused perception of such an instance. Similarly, cubical and body, given referentially <br>
 successful applications, betoken instances of the attributes that they indicate.</div>
