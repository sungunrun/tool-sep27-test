perceptual state necessitates the presence of perceptual memory by the time of the occur-<br>
rence of the use state, at latest. Memory just is the retention capacity. And the perceptual <br>
state’s content is, by steps (1) and (2), retained. That much can be recognized apriori from <br>
the example.<br>
<br>
The causal relations among the perceptual state, memory state, and use state can be <br>
known only empirically. The states are occurrent realizations of competencies. What is <br>
constant to all empirical possibilities is that the perceptual state is succeeded by the use <br>
state; the perceptual state figures in the causation of the use state; and the use state has <br>
some content retained from the perceptual state. The memory state can figure in causing <br>
the use state, in which case the memory state joins the perceptual state in guiding the use <br>
state. But the memory need not be a further cause of the use state. Of course, I assume that <br>
perceptual states last over time. So the memory state might begin to be formed before the <br>
perceptual state is completed. So in staggered fashion, both might help cause the use state. <br>
Or the perceptual state could be completed, then cause the memory state, which in turn <br>
causes the use state. Or the perceptual state could cause both memory state and use state, <br>
without the memory state’s causing the use state.<br>
<br>
However the causation works, the memory is formed. Its immediate, causal connection <br>
to the perceptual state insures that it either anaphorically preserves or fallibly tracks some <br>
of the perceptual state’s referential applications. It can preserve some or all of the percep-<br>
tual state’s attributives, though of course loss is likely. These are issues to be studied em pir-<br>
ic ally. The memory’s main difference from the perceptual state is that since it functions to <br>
refer to a past situation—the subject matter that caused the perception, it is past-tensed. <br>
One or more of its perceptual attributives is relative to a past time (with respect to the <br>
memory’s present-time anchor), whereas the same perceptual attributive applied relative <br>
to the time marked as present for the perception. All perception functions to pick out at <br>
least one feature-instance, or trope. Since feature-instances are occurrent and changeable, <br>
they can be taken to be events. So a trope can be assigned a time. The assignment is cor-<br>
rect if the trope occurs at that time. The time assigned to a past-perceived trope is past-<br>
tensed—represented in memory as occurring before the memory’s present time.<br>
<br>
There are psychological patterns in retention of the first perceptual state—that is, in the <br>
memory. They govern what and how much is retained and how the retention affects the <br>
use state, either by causing it or by affecting it after the use state is formed. The patterns <br>
govern whether there is a retention limit for the memory. They govern how the memory <br>
interacts with a perceptual state that succeeds the first perceptual state.285 These principles <br>
are topics for science to understand. Postulation of memory in the case is not otiose or <br>
even optional.<br><br>

<b>FOOTNOTES</b><br>
<b>Cont FN</b>285 I am assuming that the creature does not regularly go blind when the use state is caused. On the assump-<br>
tion, a second perceptual state is triggered by new proximal stimulation. I assume that this second perceptual <br>
state occurs at the same time that the use state occurs. So the use state is accompanied by a memory, and guided <br>
either only by the initial triggering perception or by both that perception and the memory. The memory, the <br>
second perceptual state, and the use state are all contemporaneous. The second perceptual state may have the <br>
same attributional content that its predecessor has. Obviously, there could be no second perceptual state, con-<br>
temporaneous with the use state. The creature <i>could</i> go temporarily blind, perhaps to save energy, after the initial <br>
perception triggers the use state. The assumption of a second perceptual state is inessential to my account. I keep <br>
track of it to make the example as realistic as possible. I rely only on the use state’s function to take over some of <br>
the initial perception’s representational, attributional content. A key point centers on the relation between the <br>
use state’s function and veridicality condition, on one hand, and the function and veridicality conditions of the <br>
first perceptual state and its memory, on the other.</div>
