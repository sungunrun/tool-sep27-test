orientation, and size constancies—are available. They are probably less stable than work <br>
on pre-perceptual registration. Shape constancies and categorization are understood <br>
much less well. There are informed conjectures, sketchy proposals, and some causal mod-<br>
eling. However, the problem of producing accounts of the processing laws is so hard that <br>
discussion of these topics should be seen as informed conjecture, not established know-<br>
ledge. Interesting science has been done. One should, however, bear in mind that it is early <br>
days in understanding many topics that I discuss.<br><br>

<b>Some Main Brain Areas Involved in Visual Processing<br><br>
</div>
</b>As framework for more detailed discussion, I sketch some areas of the brain that underlie <br>
visual processing.<br>
<br>
The main proximal stimulus for visual processing, known as the retinal image, is regis-<br>
tered in the retina. Substantial processing of this initial registration occurs already in the <br>
eye.492 The results of this processing are conveyed through the optic nerves leading back <br>
from the retina of each eye. Each optic nerve carries over one million fibers. Signals pro-<br>
ceed toward the back of the head, through a sub-cortical area (literally, underneath the <br>
cortex), called the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN). See Figures 11.1a and 11.1b.<br><br>
