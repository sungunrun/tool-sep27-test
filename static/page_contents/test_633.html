Perceptual Anticipation 633</div>
<br><br>
The state represents the impala-shaped impala-body (remembered from a perception <br>
before it went behind trees) and attributes to it a future location LocL2 relative to the <br>
indexed lion-location and the anticipation’s indexed present time, xt. The future time (t + xt), <br>
more realistically thought of as a time interval, is measured psychologically as starting <br>
from the present (xt). The content is accurate if and only if the impala-shaped impala-<br>
body emerges from the trees at location, LocL2, at time, (t + xt). I use an individual constant <br>
‘t’ for time. A full account would have a relational time attributive, part of the temporal <br>
coordinate system, with the content magnitude t from xt.<br>
<br>
There are also anticipatory representations that are <i>schematic</i> regarding <i>which</i> entity of <br>
a given type will appear at a given position at a given future time. Suppose that the lion <br>
sets up attack position at a given afternoon time, anticipating an impala (but no particular <br>
remembered impala) to emerge from the trees in a specific time interval. Then the antici-<br>
pation would be:<br><br>
Anticipation: (here-cego xp)(nowego (xt)(that x)(that y)<br>
<br>
[impala-shapeb9(c) (x), impala-shapeb9(i)(y), impala-bodyi9(i)(x), LocL2(c)(x, xp, (xt + n))]<br><br>
The state’s relation to an anticipated shape-instance and body-instance is schematic. A <br>
specific time and a specific place are framework-specified in relation to indexically <br>
referred-to ego-present and ego-here. The time measure is similar to temporal specifica-<br>
tion when a conative state refers to a target-object, and anticipates tracking the hand’s <br>
moving toward the target-object, closing the gap until the target-object is grasped. Again, <br>
movement to another place at a future-measured time can be anticipatorily represented. <br>
(See Chapter 14.) The time-interval representation, like the body and shape representa-<br>
tions, could be schematic—not specific, as it is here.<br>
<br>
Obviously, anticipatory perceptual representation grounds future tense in language.<br>
<br>
A lion’s anticipatory representation of an impala’s re-emergence can be based on long-<br>
term memory. Much shorter-term perceptual anticipation, if not anticipatory representa-<br>
tion, probably occurs in all visual systems. Probably all visual systems respond to motion. <br>
Some of these responses are not representational. The vestibulo-ocular reflex stabilizes <br>
images on the retina during head movement, producing an eye movement in the direction <br>
opposite to head movement. The reflex functions to maintain the image on the fovea, and <br>
lessens or eliminates blur. This function, not scanning the environment, may be the oldest <br>
function of eye movement. Analogs of this reflex show up not only in mammals, but in the <br>
perceptual-level capacities of praying mantises. They show up in even simpler animals that <br>
lack perception.999<br>
<br>
Such reflexes are often factors in representation of motion in depth. Such representation <br>
occurs in a wide variety of animals, including insects.1000 Given repeated exposure to <br>
en vir on men tal patterns, it is inevitable that visual systems that represent motion retain <br>
 common motion patterns and anticipate such patterns, through conditioning and adapta-<br>
tion. The retention and anticipation can be very short-term.<br><br>
