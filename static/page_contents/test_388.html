features and conjunctions of features are already present. She claimed that subsequently, <br>
the conjunctions are analyzed into separate feature maps in different feature dimensions. <br>
The separate feature maps then needed to be recombined through serial application of <br>
attention.430 So features from different dimensions were held to be conjoined on the mas-<br>
ter map <i>before</i> any application of attention, and before production of separated feature <br>
maps for the different dimensions. Only when features are recombined does the system <br>
have object files that can be matched with specifications of environmental object types in <br>
mem ory so as to produce object identification.<br>
<br>
So the two-stage theory gave way to a three-stage theory. The three stages were (1) <br>
unconscious registration of conjoined features on a master map that is not unique to a <br>
single feature-dimension (again, the theory is not specific as to whether the map is of <br>
en vir on men tal space or only the retinal image); (2) decomposition of the features into <br>
uni-dimensional feature maps, in typical cases allowing parallel feature searches; and (3) <br>
recombination of features from different dimensions on a master map, establishing object <br>
files capable of being retained in memory to yield object recognition.431 Treisman sug-<br>
gested that conscious perception emerged only at stage (3)—with the serial application of <br>
attention in the binding process.<br>
<br>
A striking aspect of this theory was that an attentional spotlight applied even at stage <br>
(1)—prior to decomposition or “analysis” at stage (2) of individual features into separate <br>
dimensions.<br>
<br>
Two empirical findings were primary in engendering these large theoretical changes.<br>
<br>
One involved a new occurrence of the McCollough effect. The standard effect derives <br>
from subjects’ staring at two alternating horizontal and vertical gratings with the same <br>
spatial frequencies. Suppose that the vertical grating comprises red and black columns and <br>
the horizontal grating comprises green and black rows. After adapting to alternating grat-<br>
ings, subjects are presented with a stationary black-white grating of the same spatial fre-<br>
quency as the gratings to which they adapted. They report experiencing a “contingent <br>
aftereffect”. In the vertical case, the white columns appear greenish—the complementary <br>
color to the red vertical columns that they had adapted to. In the horizontal case, the white <br>
columns appear reddish—again, the color complementary to the green color that they had <br>
adapted to.<br>
<br>
The critical thing to test in the 1980–1982 theory was the aftereffect specific to a con-<br>
junction of orientation and color. Houck and Hoffman investigated this aftereffect under <br>
various manipulations of attention and display size.432 The main result was straightfor-<br>
ward. Neither attention tasks nor display size affected the strength of the McCollough <br>
aftereffect. Since the aftereffect involves adaptation to conjunction of features, the result <br><br>
