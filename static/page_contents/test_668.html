Later-arriving initiations of attention supported, for example in parietal areas, in the sec-<br>
ond and third waves of visual processing, have a similar status.1091 Attention commands <br>
that yield eye movements and that enhance acuity hardly constitute a different representa-<br>
tional <i>level</i> of representation from the level of perception. The commands represent foci <br>
of attention in ways that match attributives and referential applications in perceptual <br>
attributives. They are perceptual-level. In fact, I think that both the commands and their <br>
attentional effects are <i>part</i> of the visual system. They evolved with perception in all but <br>
perhaps the most primitive perceptual systems. There is no direct inference from the fact <br>
there are sometimes cognitive causal antecedents of endogenous attention to the conclu-<br>
sion that the <i>direct</i> <i>application or the effect of attention itself</i> is cognitive. (See Chapter 15, <br>
the  sections Perceptual-level Attention Commands and Guidance of <br>
Saccades and The Executive Control System, and Propositional <br>
Drivers.)<br>
<br>
Similar remarks apply to “top-down” gist information from associative memory that <br>
figures in refining perceptual categorization in its later stages (post 150 ms). (See <br>
Chapter 13, the section Richer Perceptual Categorization and Perceptual <br>
Processing that Contributes to It.) The feedback derives from the orbital <br>
front al cortex and the hippocampus. It is normally counted “top-down”. It is interaction <br>
between two parts of visual perceptual processing (scene-gist and object perception), on <br>
one hand, and perceptual memory, principally visual perceptual long-term memory that <br>
retains past associations of perceptual attributives for gist, object shapes, and object-part <br>
shapes with perceptual attributives involved in categorization, on the other. The as so ci-<br>
ations are not just what is physically and naturally associated (zebra-shaped zebra-body <br>
with on flat surface rather than on a cloud-like shape separated from the ground). The <br>
associations depend on learning: association of kettle-shaped kettle-body, and not pig-<br>
shaped pig-body, with bodies and surfaces in kitchen-ensemble). Computational theories <br>
will connect perceptual gist and shape attributives in initial perceptual processing with <br>
gist and shape attributives in visual perceptual long-term memory.<br>
<br>
Causal relations between applications of antecedent background conceptual attribu-<br>
tives (pigconcept, pig bodyconcept, and pig-bodyconcept) and applications of counterpart percep-<br>
tual attributives (pig-bodypercept) surely occur. They are not invoked in computational <br>
ex plan ations of perceptual processing. Such explanations center on exercises of perceptual <br>
attributives, not conceptual or cognitive background.<br>
<br>
Even assuming that conceptual elements are among those that figure in the gist mem-<br>
ory associations that are activated by perceptual processing, the perceptual-level mem or-<br>
ies of gist-context must be compared—and either match or fail to match—current <br>
perceptual context-representations. These comparisons are central to current explanation. <br>
Computational explanations of perceptual processing center on these matchings—percep-<br>
tual representations from gist memory and perceptual representations in the current, <br>
early-produced perception.<br><br>
