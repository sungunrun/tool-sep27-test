initially to the reference to proper names and natural kind terms.1051 Later it was expanded <br>
to apply to their meanings, and to the contents of psychological states. A lot of meaning <br>
and reference owes much to perceptual relations to the environment.1052 The natural view <br>
that many beliefs depend partly for their content on perception, where the content of per-<br>
ception depends heavily on causal relations to instances of the kinds of things that are <br>
perceived, became widespread.<br>
<br>
As historians looked more closely at scientific revolutions, Kuhn’s idea that theories that <br>
differ in their basic principles are incommensurable, lost appeal. It was noted that eviden-<br>
tial grounds were given and slowly accepted for overturning pre-Darwinian biology and <br>
pre-Einsteinian physics. Paradigm shifts turn ultimately on observation. So the idea that <br>
the history of science shows some deep relativism among scientific theories and an inabil-<br>
ity of observation to objectively support fundamental theory-change came to seem <br>
groundless and anti-scientific.1053<br>
<br>
Meanwhile, the New Look psychology was overshadowed and superceded by work in <br>
the psychophysics of vision, especially by the dramatic development of theory led by Marr <br>
and Ullman in the 1970s. This psychological work—vastly more sophisticated, the or et ic-<br>
al ly developed, and experimentally grounded than New Look psychology—offered <br>
accounts of early and intermediate visual processing that did not appeal to concepts or <br>
beliefs in basic perception-formation processes. Perception appeared not to operate on the <br>
contents of beliefs.1054<br>
<br>
These developments in perceptual psychology and theory of meaning made the idea <br>
that science’s objectivity is threatened seem the hoax that it in fact was.<br>
<br>
In the last twenty or so years, mainly with the discovery of substantial feedback in per-<br>
ceptual processing, writers in various fields have tried to re-evaluate the question of how <br>
higher-level, “cognitive” mental states affect perception. Many writers, taking a variety of <br>
positions, have cited the dispute over New Look psychology as an antecedent to the <br>
 present dispute—as I have here. Both those who now emphasize “cognitive” effects on <br>
 perception and those who downplay such effects commonly motivate the philosophical <br>
importance of their discussions by reference to the old issue about whether scientific the-<br>
ory, or any belief-formation based on perception, can be objective. Few of the writers who <br>
make such claims pursue this issue. No writer has shown that issues about the nature of <br>
perception bear in any urgent way on the capacity of science to be objective. The reference <br>
to the objectivity of perception and science tends to play a largely advertising role.<br>
<br>
It is obvious that cognitive factors can bias what one gets out of perception. Attention <br>
affects where one directs one’s eyes and the formation of perceptions. Beliefs, intentions, <br><br>
