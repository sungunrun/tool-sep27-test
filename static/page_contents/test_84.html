two very small regions of registration, such a difference is marked by the computation. <br>
Such differences are potential smallest edge elements—which, in turn, are potential parts <br>
of a contour line. Although these differences concern two adjacent smallest regions of <br>
 sensory registration in a 2-D grid, the computation operates on a single value in the <br>
 math em at ic al representation (the Fourier transform) of the image. The value is the second <br>
derivative of the change. This value is called a ‘<i>zero-crossing</i>’. This value marks the in stant-<br>
an eous rate of change in registration of light intensity at that position. The result of this <br>
first stage of computation identifies candidate edge elements. In effect, these registrations <br>
are counterparts of very short lines in the retinal image, across which there are relatively <br>
abrupt differences in light intensity.<br>
<br>
The computation’s second stage introduces the orientation of these potential edge elem-<br>
ents. Think of the sharp changes in registrations of light intensities as very short lines <br>
along which the sharp contrasts occur in the 2-D grid that, at this point in visual process-<br>
ing, registers the retinal image. Orientations of these lines correspond to angles of their <br>
direction in the 2-D retinal image.<br>
<br>
It is known that some neuron/filters in the primary visual cortex, V1, are non-oriented. <br>
Neurons in the retina are non-oriented. When they are first stimulated, they do not regis-<br>
ter information about the orientation of changes in light frequency. But many neuron fil-<br>
ters in the primary visual cortex are oriented. These filters are, of course, further along in <br>
the processing of sensory information than the initial retinal receptors. A fair amount is <br>
known about the orientation characteristics of these neuron/filters. On average, such <br>
 neuron/filters in mammalian vision are sensitive to bands of orientation that are 40 degrees <br>
in width. For example, a neuron might be sensitive to line-segment orientations between <br>
70 and 110 degrees on a circle. The neuron fires for, and the filter registers, changes in <br>
intensity along any short edge segment oriented at an angle between 70 and 110 degrees. <br>
It fires most strongly for edge segments oriented at 90 degrees.<br>
<br>
Different neurons are specialized for many different types of orientation. For purposes <br>
of the computation, one can model orientations at approximately 10 degrees of shift in <br>
orientation. For example, in addition to our initial neuron, the computation assumes <br>
neuro ns oriented to the band between 80 and 120 degrees, 90 and 130 degrees, and so on. <br>
Around a circle, there are 18 orientations of the relevant short edge segments—across <br>
which abrupt changes of registration of light intensities occur. So there are 18 types of <br>
orientation-specialization for purposes of the idealized computation that models a much <br>
more complex set of specializations in actual mammalian V1.<br>
<br>
According to the computational model, each receptor is sensitive to a 40-degree band-<br>
width in orientation. Since there is only a 10-degree difference in receptors sensitive to a <br>
given orientation, any given potential edge element in the physical environment causes <br>
neural receptors at different bands of orientation to respond. For example, if an edge in the <br>
retinal image is oriented at 90 degrees from vertical, receptors centered on 50–90, 60–100, <br>
70–110, 80–120, and 90–130 all respond. The appropriate registration of the orientation of <br>
the edge segment is obtained by finding the peak energy response among these different <br>
orientations (presumably the response given by the receptors with the 70–110 orientation <br>
bandwidth).<br>
<br>
The computation’s second stage, then, takes every relatively abrupt difference in regis-<br>
tra tion of light intensity in the retinal image that had been flagged by the first stage, and <br>
marks the orientation of that difference. See Figure 3.1.</div>
