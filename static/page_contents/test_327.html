It is a mistake to identify a specific part of the picture that serves as a representational <br>
constituent that represents <i>any</i> relation that a picture depicts. If one object is depicted as <br>
to the left of another object, with some distance between them, there is no answer as to <br>
what <i>part</i> of the picture specifically represents the relation <i>to the left of</i>. The spatial relation <br>
is depicted, but no part of the picture corresponds specifically and proprietarily to it. The <br>
part of the picture between the parts that represent the two entities represents other par-<br>
ticulars—a background wall, for example. That part is not specific or proprietary to the <br>
relation <i>to the left of</i>. No picture-part (scattered or not) is a representational constituent <br>
specific to the relation. The relation is represented through the relations among the parts, <br>
not through a symbol for the relation. The relation <i>to the left of</i> is depicted by situating <br>
the part of the picture that represents one object to the left of the part of the picture that <br>
represents the other object (from the viewer’s perspective).<br>
<br>
English has a sentence part for the relation <i>to the left of</i>. The picture lacks any part that <br>
in itself represents the relation. Searching a picture or map for a part that indicates and <br>
attributes even a simple spatial relation is a quixotic enterprise. Yet by arranging its depic-<br>
tions spatially, a picture or map represents the relation iconically. Of course, language <br>
could represent both the relation and other things iconically, although English tends not <br>
to. A picture of a dog—used as a noun meaning that dog (in need of a supplementary <br>
pointing) could be arranged to the left of a cat picture. The arrangement could mean that <br>
dog is to the left of that cat. Whereas English has a phrase that indicates <i>to the left of</i>, visual <br>
psychology suggests no analog of a phrase that in language commonly would indicate a <br>
relation and, in the context of a sentence-use, attribute it. Computations in vision operate <br>
on representations’ <i>being</i>  in relations. Nothing in computational theory of perception <br>
requires that there be a symbol for every relation that is computed.<br>
<br>
A simple identification of picture parts with semantical constituents does not work <br>
even for iconic indication and attribution of non-relational properties. If asked what part <br>
of a picture represents the color, or size, or shape of a surface, it can seem obvious that one <br>
can draw a boundary around a relevant picture part. It is intuitive that that part represents <br>
the color, size, and shape of the surface, as well as the surfacehood of the surface. This <br>
answer is only good enough for off-hand remarks about the relation between parts and <br>
semantic constituents. It is the <i>color</i>  of the picture part that figures in representing the <br>
color in the scene. It is the scaled <i>shape</i> or <i>size</i> of the part that figures in representing the <br>
shape or size of the surface. None of these properties of a part of the picture is itself a part <br>
of the picture. Each is an aspect of a part.<br>
<br>
A similar point applies to visual perception. Different aspects of the perceptual content <br>
represent different attributes. Some sensitivity to light intensity, reflected in a natural way <br>
in intensity of neural activity, figures in iconic perceptual representation of color. Some <br>
space-like arrangement, within a sensory-registration state or perceptual state, of the effect <br>
of neural firings figures in the iconic representation of shape. Computations work as well <br>
on properties or relations as on object-like “parts”. Privileging parts is the effect of think-<br>
ing of computation in perception too much on an analogy with linguistic computation.<br>
<br>
In realist pictures, maps, and normal visual representation, properties are represented <br>
in packages. A realist picture and a normal visual perception represent a surface’s color, <br>
size, shape, orientation, location, and so on, all at once. A road map does not represent a <br>
road without representing its position, length, and shape. Such packaging is normal in <br>
many types of iconic representation. By contrast, a language user often represents a Some Ways Not to Think about Iconic Representation 327</div>
