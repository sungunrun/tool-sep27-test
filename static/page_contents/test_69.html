can center on a maximally specific discernible shade of yellow. Perception of, and as of, the <br>
color tends not to be precisely constant with respect to that shade. However, the range of <br>
variation may be small enough that it is fruitful and correct to consider the system as hav-<br>
ing a constancy for the maximally specific shade. It may be simultaneously correct to take <br>
the system to have a less approximating constancy for a more generic range of yellow. How <br>
a system groups shades can be determined only empirically.<br>
<br>
‘<i>Perceptual constancy</i>’ is a term of art. No one has defined it operationally, although <br>
there have been attempts in the history of psychology.60 I find that scientists tend to agree <br>
on cases. Such agreement survives absence of a definition, and absence of a general <br>
method for identifying perceptual constancies. One uses paradigm cases of perceptual <br>
constancies to judge new cases. Scientific practice is a guide. The notion of objectification <br>
is also a guide.<br>
<br>
Recall the initial framework characterization that I gave above:<br><br>
<i>Perceptual constancies</i> are perceptual capacities systematically to represent a given en vir-<br>
<br>
on men tal particular or attribute <i>as</i> that particular or attribute under significant differ-<br>
<br>
ences in registration of proximal stimulation.<br><br>
‘Perceptual’ occurs in this explication of ‘perceptual constancy’. The explication would be <br>
hopelessly circular as a definition. It is just a starting point for better understanding.<br>
<br>
Understanding what a <i>perceptual</i> constancy is requires considering what the science <br>
counts as perceptual, and reflecting on objectification. One cannot simply apply the char-<br>
ac ter iza tion as a recipe. I discuss some cases to try to provide insight into what is involved <br>
in recognizing an invariance or constancy as perceptual.<br>
<br>
By far, the most studied perceptual constancies are in vision. There are perceptual con-<br>
stancies in other sensory modalities—tactile, auditory, proprioceptive.61 There may be <br>
perceptual constancies in human sensory modalities beyond those that I listed, such as <br>
smell and taste. If so, they are not agreed upon, to my knowledge. I focus mainly on vision. <br>
However, I take much of the discussion to apply to other sensory modalities that have <br>
perceptual constancies. Hence I take other sensory modalities to involve the objectifica-<br>
tion characteristic of all perception.<br><br>
