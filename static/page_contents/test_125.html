It is also common that, on occasions when a perceiver’s perceptual system attributes a <br>
relatively specific shade, it attributes a more generic shade that includes the more specific <br>
shade as one of several species of the more generic shade. Slight discernible differences are <br>
almost inevitably grouped. Commonly, memory and action work with a wider band of <br>
shades than the minimally distinguishable shades, or the most fine-grained, grouped bands <br>
of such shades. Of course, this is an empirical matter. The more generic colors that include <br>
as species the most specific, barely discernible shades cannot be expected always to coincide <br>
with groupings that languages make salient.132 Groupings vary with individuals and species. <br>
One can show that a species or individual does not have an attributive for a specific band of <br>
shades by showing that it does not respond to that band in any special way.<br>
<br>
Shades are grouped insofar as the just-discernibly different shades are more or less <br>
equivalent for some purposes of action or reaction. For example, an ape can see different <br>
shades of brown in viewing coconuts. A range of shades of brown may be equally good as <br>
cues to a type of food. Although the ape’s visual system can and normally does distinguish <br>
different shades, the differences are unimportant for many of the ape’s purposes. Such dif-<br>
ferences, in many contexts, yield the same action-response. The response can be as fast as <br>
responses get. Memories can wash out differences that are perceptually discerned. There is <br>
therefore reason to believe that there are not only various very specific color-shade attrib-<br>
utives within the range of <i>brown</i>. There is often a perceptual attributive that applies to a <br>
band of specific color shades (the band, <i>brown</i>).<br>
<br>
I think that the generic property <i>color</i> is also attributed.133 Why? There is a standing <br>
competence to attribute color, as distinct from shape and other generic attributes. This <br>
competence has general characteristics. It operates on light intensities, represents hue, <br>
involves color constancies that filter illumination from reflectance, and so on. Such a per-<br>
ceptual attributive just <i>is</i> a repeatable (ability-general) kind of perceptual competence to <br>
respond to instances of color, in ways that can be evaluated for accuracy. Exercises of the <br>
generic color competence are certainly perceptual. They can be evaluated for accuracy. <br>
<i>Color</i> is always attributed when a color shade is attributed. Although most attributions of <br>
the generic property <i>color</i> or <i>colored</i> are accurate, the system could generate a color-shade <br>
attribution, and with it an attribution of <i>color</i>, and be mistaken about both—if no color <br>
causes the perceptual response. Then no color would be perceived. Of course, the color-<br>
shade or color-band attributive could be inaccurate of what is perceived, while the also-<br>
exercised generic attributive color is accurate of it.<br>
<br>
When both a color shade and <i>color</i> are attributed, there need not be, and almost cer-<br>
tainly is not, a computation beyond the computation of a color-shade attribution, to an <br>
attribution of <i>color</i>. The generic capacity is exercised when the specific capacity is exercised.<br>
<br>
Note that one cannot show that a perceptual system that attributes very specific color <br>
shades does not attribute <i>color</i> in the same way in which one can show that such a system <br>
does not have an attributive for a given color band that is wider than the specific shade <br>
(but narrower than <i>color</i>). Any system that represents a color shade is differentially respon-<br>
sive to color.<br><br>
