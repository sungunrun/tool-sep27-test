that one accurately perceives, with help of a perceptual constancy, the same edge, as a <br>
straight edge of length <i>l</i>, with the surface’s top slanted back at a 30-degree angle. (See <br>
Figure 7.1 above.) One perceives the textural elements as having the spatial arrangement <br>
and sizes that one perceived them as having when they were not slanted. Imagine a realist <br>
drawing of the top edge of the backward-slanted surface and the edge’s length <i>l</i>. The <i>draw-<br>
ing</i> of the edge differs from the drawing of the same edge and length in the frontal-parallel <br>
plane. The line is shorter. The line representing the edge and its length is a different way of <br>
representing the same attributes. The drawings of the textural elements differ from a draw-<br>
ing that represents the same attributes when the surface is not slanted. The drawings of <br>
textural elements at the slanted surface’s top are smaller, closer together, more oval.<br>
<br>
In a language, one can dispense with a coordinate system, and simply specify the edge’s <br>
length as being so many meters long in both upright and slanted conditions. But in the <br>
second drawing, the edge and its length, and the spatial attributes of the textural elements, <br>
are represented differently from how each of those attributes is represented in the first <br>
drawing. The lines represent the edge and its constant length in different ways. The draw-<br>
ings represent the textural elements as having constant sizes, shapes. They do so in differ-<br>
ent ways.<br>
<br>
The drawings meet the three conditions. First, they are presented in an egocentrically <br>
anchored coordinate system. The drawing is from the perspective of the artist on the sub-<br>
ject matter. Second, the drawings use the coordinate system in representing the edge, its <br>
shape (straightness or, in other cases, specific curvature), and its length. Each of the prop-<br>
erties is plotted, mapped, in the coordinate system. Each discernible part of the edge is <br>
represented as occupying a position (in some cases, an approximate position) in a system <br>
of spatial properties and spatial relations. In cases in which the position is not in de ter min-<br>
ate, the line represents a specific shape and length. Parts of the line represent discernible <br>
parts of the shape and discernible sub-segments of the length as occupying their own <br>
positions in the system. Third, the spatial relation between coordinate system and en vir on-<br>
ment can change. It does change between the first and second drawings.<br>
<br>
Perceptual representations differ from drawings in many ways. Drawings are perceived, <br>
as well as being representations of something further. Perceptual representations are not <br>
perceived. Drawings are intentionally and (usually) consciously produced. Perceptual rep-<br>
resentations are not products of action, much less intention-guided action. Their produc-<br>
tion is unconscious. The iconic relation between drawings and their subject matters <br>
involves literal mappings between spatial aspects of the drawing and spatial aspects of the <br>
subject matter. The correspondences between perceptions and the layout of their represen-<br>
tational contents, on one hand, and the layout of entities that they represent in space, on <br>
the other, is more abstract. I return to these matters in Chapter 9.218<br>
<br>
Still, perceptual representations, including perceptual attributives for these attributes, <br>
are relevantly similar to drawings. The features of drawings that I have emphasized have <br>
clear analogs in the representational structures of perception. The indicated and attributed <br>
non-relational attributes that remain constant are each represented by modes of represen-<br>
tation—attributives—that differ in different stimulus conditions. The idea of a single <br>
canonical representation for each of the constant attributes is mistaken. The representational <br><br>

being F even though perception lacks an attributive for F.</div>
