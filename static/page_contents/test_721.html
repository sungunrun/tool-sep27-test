past-perceived scene is thus more abstract than the original, detailed perceptual represen-<br>
tation. The generic aspects are normally already represented in the original perception. <br>
Again, this is abstraction through loss. Here there is no ascent from perception to a supra-<br>
perceptual “cognitive” memory. Since the more generic representations are already present <br>
in earlier perception, their remaining as the primary representations in perceptual mem-<br>
ory does not result from a psychological operation of abstraction. Of course, the empiri-<br>
cist idea that abstraction is a move in the direction of thought or supra-perceptual <br>
cognition has no credible application to the case.<br>
<br>
A further type of abstractness in perception and perceptual-level representation is attri-<br>
bution of relations. Perceptual representation of relations has never been a comfortable <br>
topic for the empiricist model. Yet relations are richly attributed in perception. One basis <br>
for traditional empiricist discomfort is that finding a concrete phenomenal look for a rela-<br>
tion is not straightforward, at least compared with the look associated with the more spe-<br>
cific property representations in an image. No visible part or aspect of a picture or image <br>
corresponds to a relation representation. (See Chapter 9.) In iconic representation, rela-<br>
tions tend to be represented via relations among non-relational attributional elements. In <br>
these ways, perceptual representations of relations are more abstract than at least the most <br>
concrete perceptual representations of properties.<br>
<br>
It seems plausible that iconic representation of relations in perceptual representation <br>
makes them harder to attend to. Attention is naturally drawn to the entities that enter into <br>
the relations and to instances of properties. These are the perceived entities. Having sym-<br>
bols for relations makes them easier to attend and to form operations upon them. Children <br>
learn words for relations more slowly than they do words for other things. A capacity to <br>
manipulate relations is a mark of cognitive development. (See this chapter, the section <br>
What Should Count as Cognition?.)<br>
<br>
For all that, relations are indicated and attributed in perception. (See Chapter 6, the sec-<br>
tion, Perceptual Attribution of Relations.) How are perceptual attributives <br>
for relations arrived at and exercised? Again, they are not in general arrived at through a <br>
psychological operation of abstraction from a more concrete base. The basic ones are sim-<br>
ply perceptual, relational attributive capacities that are part of the natural equipment of <br>
perception. Others are perceptually learned. Most perceptual learning is not fruitfully <br>
understood on the model of an operation of abstraction.<br>
<br>
The empiricist idea that abstract representation is not present, or not basic, in percep-<br>
tion is a mistake. Many types of abstract representation figure in perception, from the first <br>
exercises of an individual’s perceptual capacities. Many are simply aspects of capacities to <br>
perceptually group entities and represent the world perceptually. The empiricist mistake <br>
derives partly from focusing entirely on the iconic or imagistic format of perception to the <br>
exclusion of the forms, functions, and competencies underlying its exercises and <br>
its uses.1171<br>
<br>
A central theme of this work has been that understanding perception should attend <br>
more to its representational form. Form is a window into representational function, which <br>
is in turn a window into representational capacities. Capacities ground function and form. <br><br>
