Primitive Attribution of Agency 469</div>

attribution is, of course, grouping of animal-shaped animal-bodies. That alone does not <br>
evince animacy representation. Even when the shape representation is accompanied with <br>
anticipation of biological motion, such representation, when accompanied by the anticipa-<br>
tions that I go on to describe, are, I think, agency representations not animacy representa-<br>
tions. Given that both are common in the representer’s environment, and given that <br>
evidence for agency representation is, at early stages of infant development, clear-cut, tak-<br>
ing infants to attribute animacy needs specific evidence that differentiates such attribution <br>
from agency attribution. I briefly discuss animacy representation further below.<br>
<br>
Human infants’ avoidance of spider-shapes is present at birth. Representation of agency <br>
centered on motion may emerge later. Attribution of agency from motion is evident by <br>
3–4 months. After this period, it develops a more complex relational structure. By 6 <br>
months, infants attribute <i>specific</i> targets to agents of endogenously produced motion.614 <br>
Movement of a hand is associated with an anticipated, specific grasped object. This asso-<br>
ciation is more basic than association of a hand with the spatial path that the hand takes to <br>
reach the object. For after habituation, when the path is held constant, but the hand grasps <br>
a different object in the same place, infants dishabituate. By contrast, if the hand takes a <br>
different path to grasp the same object, they do not dishabituate.<br>
<br>
Spatially separated shapes that move in tandem are quickly associated with chasing and <br>
fleeing. A larger ball is represented as having the target, catching a smaller ball. The smaller <br>
ball is accorded the fleeing role. Infants are habituated to a shape’s moving towards one of <br>
two other target shapes. When the locations of the targets are switched, infants dishabitu-<br>
ate more to movement towards a new target than to a new location. This difference in <br>
response occurs only if the initially moving shape moves non-rigidly and rhythmically. So <br>
infants are disposed to anticipate one ball’s chasing another, regardless of what paths the <br>
infants have habituated to.615 So self-movement in a perceived entity is contextually asso-<br>
ciated with specific targets or functions, and with specific types of agency, such as grasp-<br>
ing, chasing, fleeing.616<br>
<br>
In anticipating agency by objects that have exhibited biological motion, infants are sen-<br>
sitive to asymmetries in the bodily orientation of the agent. Newborns preferentially <br>
attend to faces and respond to them by mimicking their expressions.617 Infants are dis-<br>
posed to anticipate agency in the direction in which the eye-like or face-like parts of an <br>
agent are pointed. A tendency to follow gaze has been found in 2–3-month-old human <br>
infants.618 By 6 months, at latest, this tendency is integrated with representation of agency.<br>
<br>
6-month-olds are sensitive to whether an action target can be sensed by an agent. There <br>
is a line for sensing between the eyes and a potential target that is relevant to the infant in <br><br>
