There is a notion of a Goodmanian part that would include any aggregate of scattered <br>
parts of the picture as making up a part.346 For example, the part that depicts the upper <br>
half of the left-most giraffe’s left ear and the part that depicts the right-most third of the <br>
highest leaf on the right-most background tree are not contiguous. One Goodmanian part <br>
of the picture consists of these non-contiguous picture parts.<br>
<br>
Fodor does not rule out Goodmanian parts. His phrase ‘cut it into parts whichever way <br>
you like’ and his talk of ‘reassembling’ the parts do not stipulate that the assemblies, short <br>
of the whole reassembled picture, must be among erstwhile contiguous parts. Whether or <br>
not Fodor intended to include Goodmanian picture parts, let us pursue these matters a <br>
step further.<br>
<br>
PP(1), PP(2), and PP(2΄) retain <i>some</i> intuitive appeal even on the Goodmanian under-<br>
standing. The illustrated scattered “part” of the picture can be taken to depict a scattered <br>
part of the scene. Why should one not allow Goodmanian parts to count as parts?<br>
<br>
It is not credible that so broad a notion of depiction is relevant to a serious semantics. It <br>
is not credible that a serious semantics takes arbitrary scattered parts of the picture as <br>
representational units. The picture’s semantics, like all semantics, hinges on use—and on <br>
the competencies that figure in the picture’s production and appreciation. Its use and the <br>
associated psychological competencies reside in the perceptual segmentation of pictures, <br>
the intentions of the painter, and the conventions of interpretation for realist paintings. <br>
Nothing in the use, production, or appreciation of the picture corresponds to, or is <br>
explained in terms of, any such unnatural representational units. Use, production, and <br>
appreciation treat the part of the picture that pictures a whole giraffe as a unit. They do not <br>
treat as a unit the cited scattered Goodmanian picture part.<br>
<br>
The part–whole relation for pictures that is relevant to representational units for a seman-<br>
tics is constrained. It does not follow off-the-cuff intuitions about the parts of pictures.<br>
<br>
Suppose that PP(2΄) is understood to <i>exclude</i> Goodmanian scattered parts. Every part <br>
of a part is to be taken to be contiguous to some other part of the part. The same prob-<br>
lems remain.<br>
<br>
Take a part of the picture whose left side corresponds to a small sliver of a giraffe’s right <br>
flank, and whose right side corresponds to a mélange of a part of a tree trunk, parts of a <br>
couple of branches, parts of leaves, and parts of patches of sky behind the foliage. Take the <br>
left and right sides of the part to be contiguous. One might find it intuitive that this picture <br>
part represents a part of the scene. It is the part consisting of that sliver of the giraffe, that <br>
part of the tree trunk, the mix of branch and leaf parts, and the visible parts of sky behind <br>
the foliage. One might grant that that is a part of a scene. One might grant that that scene-<br>
part gets represented in a rough intuitive sense. A serious semantics of the picture should <br>
not and does not follow such intuitions.<br>
<br>
The picture’s semantics hinges on its use and on relevant psychological competencies, <br>
processes, and understanding. Nothing in these resources corresponds to such “units”. <br>
Perceptual segmentation, intentions of the painter, and conventions of interpretation for <br>
realist paintings simply do not cut the painting in that way. That picture part is not a repre-<br>
sentational unit.<br><br>
