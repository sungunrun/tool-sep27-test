Perceptual Anticipation 637</div>
<br><br>
Anticipatory perceptual representation is, of course, a primitive ancestor of scientific <br>
prediction. Perceptual memory is, of course, a primitive ancestor of history. But the real <br>
functional differences between perception, on one hand, and perceptual memory and per-<br>
ceptual anticipation, on the other, do not correspond to any momentous differences in <br>
psychological capacity, or evolutionary level, that might suggest some deep cut in the <br>
architecture of the mind. The differences contain seeds of deeper differences that emerge <br>
later. The seeds are no more advanced that those involved in the present-stimulus-driven, <br>
operations in perception itself. I discuss these points further in Chapter 19, the section <br>
Uses and Misuses of the Term ‘Cognition’.<br>
<br>
Anticipatory perceptual-level representation in higher animals is not confined to the <br>
type that guides motion tracking. The lion’s anticipatory representation of the impala’s <br>
position in a patiently awaited future is an example. There is anticipatory representation of <br>
the whereabouts of danger or food on navigational maps. Anticipatory representation <br>
looms large as an auxiliary in perception-guided action (Chapter 14). Simple actions are <br>
guided by anticipatory reference to moving target and moving agent-body-parts in antici-<br>
pated positions.<br>
<br>
What does it take to refer, at the perceptual level, to particulars in the future? I do not <br>
hope for a full answer. There are two broad necessary conditions. One is that the psycho-<br>
logical states use a perceptual-level competence. The other is that the competence have a <br>
specific, occurrence-based causal connection to the referred-to particular. Sometimes the <br>
particular is tracked from <i>de re</i> reference in perceptual memory and future-perceived fea-<br>
tures are anticipated. Sometimes anticipatory references are associated with actions that <br>
cause referents to come into being.<br>
<br>
If the particular is moving, or is a movement, the perceiver might be tracking it. Or, as <br>
in the lion-impala case, the agent has tracked a particular, holds reference to it in long-<br>
term memory, and projects an anticipatory perceptual reference to it. The state in effect <br>
anticipates a new causal chain to the particular, and attributes ways in which it is antici-<br>
pated to be, places at which it is anticipated to be located.<br>
<br>
Causal chains to anticipated particulars can be set via action. Agents can rest anticipa-<br>
tory reference on causal relations that will establish causal relations to target-objects as <br>
they will be in the future. Then anticipatory perceptual reference to the object’s anticipated <br>
property-instances can, but need not, depend on an action being prepared and under the <br>
agent’s causal control.<br>
<br>
Of course, human adults can predict particulars propositionally. They can anticipate, <br>
from astronomical calculations, a past-perceived comet to appear at a certain position in <br>
the sky. This is not perceptual-level <i>de re</i> anticipatory reference. To be perceptual-level, the <br>
anticipation must be grounded in perceptual-level tracking procedures or action <br>
procedures.<br>
<br>
Psychological discussion of episodic memory and counterparts in long-term anticipa-<br>
tion took an unfortunate turn when Tulving changed his initial explication, asserting that <br>
episodic memory is distinguished by autonoetic consciousness—autobiographical self-<br>
consciousness that picks out particulars in the past.<br>
<br>
Tulving’s taxonomy here is confined to long-term memory. He distinguished declara-<br>
tive, voluntarily accessible memory from non-declarative memory. Declarative memory is <br>
distinguished by its being available to voluntary control. Declarative memory then divides <br>
into semantic memory and episodic memory. Semantic memory is supposed to carry </div>
