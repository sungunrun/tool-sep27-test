320 The Iconic Nature of Perception</div>
<br><br>
Consider the following analog of arguments for the intuitiveness of PP(2΄)—supporting <br>
respectively the Goodmanian and contiguity notions of part. Someone might argue as <br>
follows.<br><br>
(Goodmanian) The scattered part of the sentence ‘The dog nuzzled the cat’ that consists <br>
<br>
of the words ‘The dog’ and ‘the cat’ represents the dog and the cat. The dog and the cat, <br>
<br>
together, make up a part of the state of affairs that the sentence represents. So the part of <br>
<br>
the sentence consisting of ‘The dog’ and ‘the cat’ represents that part of the state of affairs <br>
<br>
consisting of the dog and the cat. Any combination of any two words or word-<br>
<br>
combinations in a sentence, each of which represents a part of a state of affairs that the <br>
<br>
sentence represents, is a semantical unit and itself represents a part of that state of affairs. <br>
<br>
So ‘the dog the cat’ is a semantical unit that represents a part of the state of affairs.<br><br>
(Contiguous) The part of the sentence ‘The dog nuzzled the cat’ that consists of ‘The dog <br>
<br>
nuzzled’ represents a part of the state of affairs represented by the sentence. It represents <br>
<br>
the dog and the nuzzling. These make up a part of the state of affairs that the sentence <br>
<br>
 represents. So the part of the sentence consisting of ‘The dog’ and ‘nuzzled’ represents the <br>
<br>
part of the state of affairs consisting of the dog and the nuzzling. Any com bin ation of <br>
<br>
 contiguous words in a sentence, each of which represents a part of a state of affairs that the <br>
<br>
sentence represents, is a semantical unit and itself represents a part of that state of affairs. <br>
<br>
So ‘The dog nuzzled’ is a semantical unit that represents a part of the state of affairs.<br><br>
Naively, both arguments are intuitive. However, anyone who knows anything about the <br>
semantics of language knows that these are bad arguments. Neither ‘The dog the cat’ nor <br>
‘The dog nuzzled’ is a semantical or syntactical unit in the sentence. ‘The cat’ is embedded <br>
in a verb phrase that is independent of ‘the dog’. ‘Nuzzled’ dominates that verb phrase, and <br>
is again not a part of any semantical or syntactical unit with ‘The dog’, except the unit of <br>
the sentence. The sentence is built from a noun phrase and a verb phrase. Decomposition <br>
of the sentence does not cut across these units. ‘Nuzzled’ and ‘the cat’ are embedded in one <br>
unit, with ‘nuzzled’ dominating ‘the cat’. ‘The dog’ is another unit. One cannot mix and <br>
match. We know these things via reflection on patterns of linguistic usage, competence, <br>
production, and understanding.<br>
<br>
Fodor recites such facts about language. Analogous points undermine his claims about <br>
pictures. The idea that there are no semantically natural joints in pictorial representation <br>
that depict natural joints in the scene has nothing to be said for it. Arbitrary combinations <br>
of picture parts can seem naively to represent parts of the scene. Most such combinations <br>
correspond to no units that figure in usage or understanding. Usage and understanding <br>
ground any serious semantics for pictures. They ground postulating picture parts or <br>
aspects that correspond to natural perceptual, intended, or conventionally demarcated <br>
units in the scene.<br>
<br>
Parts of the picture figure in representation of a giraffe’s body and body-parts. Parts of <br>
the picture represent natural constituents of the background and those constituents’ parts. <br>
Each of these scene parts is represented in the picture—just as nuzzling, the cat, and the <br>
dog are each represented in the sentence ‘The dog nuzzled the cat’. One can compose arbi-<br>
trary “parts” of a scene out of such materials. There is no representational <i>unit</i> formed by <br>
combining arbitrary picture parts—anymore than ‘The dog the cat’ is a representational </div>
