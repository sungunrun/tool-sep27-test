Such a psychological capacity goes beyond the perceptual-level. It is proto-typically <br>
conceptual.131<br>
<br>
So there is no perceptual attributive for <i>dog</i>, <i>water</i>, or <i>iron</i>, where the italicized terms <br>
are taken to designate natural kinds. One can perceive dogs, water, and iron. One cannot <br>
perceive them <i>as</i> dogs, water, or iron. One lacks perceptual attributives for such natural <br>
kinds. Putative evidence for perceptually distinguishing dogs is evidence for perceptually <br>
distinguishing dog-shaped dog-bodies, capable of characteristic motions. It is known that <br>
perceptual systems have attributives for shapes and bodies grouped by shape. A dog-<br>
shaped dog-body (with dog-motion) is a different kind from a dog. Both are prevalent in <br>
the environment. Since attributives are capacities, in order to have an attributive that indi-<br>
cates and attributes <i>dog</i>, which is a distinct kind from <i>dog-body</i> (<i>et al</i>.), an individual must <br>
have representational capacities, specific to <i>dog</i>, over and above capacities for representing <br>
dog-shaped dog-bodies, capable of relevant motions. I think that perceptual systems do <br>
not, and cannot, have the relevant further capacities. Similarly, for <i>water</i> and <i>iron</i>. There <br>
are perceptual capacities for perceiving something as a clear drinkable liquid. Those <br>
capacities are not capacities for attributing a natural kind. So it is correct to explain per-<br>
ceptual capacities in terms of attributives for shapes, motions, lightness, translucence, <br>
rigidity, and bodies, instead of attributives that are associated with an openness to distin-<br>
guishing how something (veridically) looks from what it is. Of course, perceptual group-<br>
ing of dog-shaped dog-bodies, or x-ray-machine-shaped x-ray-machine-bodies, is not an <br>
innate capacity. Perception forms such groups through interaction with instances. I dis-<br>
cuss perceptual learning in Chapter 18.<br>
<br>
Tuning perceptual attributions for specific shapes plausibly derives from a combination <br>
of innate responses to shapes or symmetries, and learned responses to specific shapes stat-<br>
is tic al ly common in a perceiver’s environment. Both innate and learned shape attributions <br>
are elements in perceptual constancies that were formed through interactions between <br>
perceivers and important or common spatial patterns in the environment.<br><br>

<b>Taxonomic Hierarchies in Perception<br><br>
</div>
</b>Humans can perceptually distinguish over a million color shades. Since perceptual <br>
attributives are perceptual discriminative capacities, humans have over a million per-<br>
ceptual attributives for color. In animal visual systems with color vision, there are also <br>
commonly attributions of wider bans of color—color shades grouped into color-types. <br>
Usually, when one perceptually attributes a wider band of shades than the maximally <br>
fine-grained shades that one can perceptually discern, one perceptually attributes finer-<br>
grained shades as well. One can certainly see an instance of the maximally fine-grained <br>
color shade that is presented to one, even as one’s system groups that color shade into a <br>
wider band.<br><br>

AttriButiveS and Chapter 19, the section FrameworK ISSueS. Some claim that representations of entities <br>
that are natural kinds have a different visual phenomenology from representations as of corresponding shapes/<br>
sizes. I cannot discern such phenomenological differences. Even if I could, such differences could not pos sibly <br>
indicate where in the psychology—in the perceptual system or in some higher-level cognitive system—the <br>
 representations are formed. Phenomenology is no route to understanding psychological architecture.</div>
