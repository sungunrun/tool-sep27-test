op er ation—finding equivalences among <i>environmental</i> structures that <i>differ</i> in size, but <br>
share a spatial layout. Emphatically, this capacity differs from the capacity that yields size <br>
constancy and any capacity that yields shape constancy via rotations. In those cases, a dif-<br>
ferently presented shape or size is represented as the same. The present problem is to rep-<br>
resent different sizes as structurally equivalent. The scaling is not on representational <br>
perspectives. It is on an external attribute.<br>
<br>
This external scaling appears to have two forms. If 2½-year-olds can be brought to <br>
think of differences in scale of a given scene as resulting from a physical change—say, a <br>
shrinking—of a single entity, they can do the scaling. 2½-year-olds are asked to find a hid-<br>
den object in a larger or smaller room that is a scale model of a room in which they had <br>
just found a comparable object. They cannot do it. 3-year-olds can. However, if the <br>
2½-year-olds are brought to represent the smaller room as the result of shrinking the <br>
larger room, they can solve the problem. If they represent there being two rooms, they <br>
cannot solve it until age 3.1190<br>
<br>
This result suggests two types of external scaling. Both scale environmental particulars <br>
in spatial structures, rather than registrations of the retinal image, or perceptual represen-<br>
tations of a size despite perspectival differences. Judy DeLoache and colleagues think that <br>
the first sort of scaling depends on representing different spatial structures as that of a <br>
single object that changes in size. If that is so, this first type of external scaling is a version <br>
of perceptual object-tracking—using perceptual memory or perceptual imagining. There <br>
seems nothing supra-perceptual about the operation. Perceptually tracking individuals <br>
behind occlusions tolerates their growing or shrinking. Tracking an object that grows or <br>
shrinks while its spatial structure remains otherwise the same is a familiar type of <br>
perceptual-level object tracking.<br>
<br>
The second type of external scaling is comparing and aligning, usually unconsciously, <br>
one external scene-structure with another. At a more advanced stage, such scaling involves <br>
using one scene or structure as representation of the other. This second externalized scal-<br>
ing operation anticipates map reading. The map and mapped terrain share a structure and <br>
differ in scale.1191<br>
<br>
Although there are scaling operations in pre-perceptual registrations in the visual sys-<br>
tem, in perceptual representations linked in a size constancy, and in both types of exter-<br>
nalized scaling, the second type of externalized scaling may, like map-reading, lack a <br>
presence in perceptual-level processing. I think it a candidate for a non-propositional <br>
cognitive operation.<br>
<br>
It is often claimed that animals make <i>transitive inferences</i>, especially about social hier-<br>
arch ies and dominance relations. Higher primates keep track of dominance relations <br>
among many animals in a social group. It is controversial how to account for these capaci-<br>
ties. Some claim that processes fall under a general transitive inference rule. Others claim <br>
that the capacities can be explained by postulating various lower-level, non-cognitive <br>
capacities, including but not limited to association. No doubt, different species use differ-<br>
ent capacities. Small fish as well as primates produce dominance orderings. An operation <br>
correctly explained as following a transitive operation rule would plausibly be cognitive. It <br><br>
