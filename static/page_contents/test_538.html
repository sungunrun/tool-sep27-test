538 Perceptual Attention</div>
<br><br>
Perception for unattended matters can be degraded in accuracy through infusion of <br>
attention to other matters. More surprisingly, applications of attention can degrade repre-<br>
sentational accuracy of the <i>attentionally enhanced</i> aspects of perception. That is, aspects of <br>
perception boosted by attention can represent less accurately than those aspects did before <br>
they were selected by attention.<br>
<br>
There are many such effects. They occur at small scales, and are most widespread and <br>
varied with exogenous covert spatial attention. Sometimes they are correctable by <br>
en dogen ous covert or overt spatial attention. Endogenous covert spatial attention can cre-<br>
ate them too.<br>
<br>
An example is an effect by covert exogenous spatial attention on perception of temporal <br>
separation. Two small visible flashes of a disc are each presented for 47 ms, sequentially <br>
separated by 11 to 34 ms. On interspersed occasions, one disc is presented, without inter-<br>
ruption, for 105–130 ms. When subjects fixate a central position, and their attention is <br>
drawn to the right, and the flashes are presented on the left, they correctly perceive the two <br>
flashes. If they fixate centrally, having their attention drawn to the left, and the flashes are <br>
presented on the left, they tend to see a continuous flash—misperceiving the events. This <br><br>
