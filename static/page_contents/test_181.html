Scope Hierarchies in Perceptual Content 181</div>
<br><br>
In these formulas, neither the scope nor the order of the quantifiers matters to the <br>
 conditions that make the sentences true, as long as the quantifiers bind the appropriate <br>
variables.<br>
<br>
Why should there be any scope for scope in perceptual representational content? <br>
Wide scope marks a psychologically privileged status for the relevant applications and <br>
attributions. More generally, scope dominance marks psychological and functional <br>
 priority. This point is of some importance for understanding the nature of perceptual <br>
 representational content.<br>
<br>
The function of perception is to pick out particulars. Picking out is reference. All per-<br>
ceptual attributives serve referential applications. Perceptual attributives are often <br>
applied by referential applications to instances of the attribute that they indicate. As I have <br>
argued, relational attributives are exceptions. They do not function to apply to perceived <br>
instances—to betoken anything. We do not see the empty-space relation between two <br>
objects separated from one another. We perceive the objects <i>as being</i> in the relation<i>.</i> It is <br>
the <i>relata</i> or a <i>relatum—</i>a particular—that exerts causal power on the perceptual system, <br>
not the relation-instance. The relation is attributed as being among particulars. Although <br>
relational attributives do not guide intra-attribute attribution, they function to characterize <br>
particulars picked out by referential applications. By (AA1), Chapter 5, these referential <br>
applications themselves are guided by attributives attributed in the intra-attribute way. <br>
Thus if a relation of <i>next-to</i> is attributed to a pair of particulars, the perceptual system <br>
applies a kind-or feature-(a one-place) attributive to the <i>relata</i>.<br>
<br>
The structure of perceptual content reflects this fact. Perceptual representational con-<br>
tent has the form of a noun phrase governed by—scope-dominated by—demonstrative-<br>
like referential applications that function to pick out or refer. In actual perception, <br>
these demonstrative-like referential applications—which mark perceptual picking-out—all <br>
depend on occurrent causal relations to the subject matter to secure a perceptual referent. <br>
Always or nearly always, perceptual representational content involves multiple such <br>
referential applications.<br>
<br>
Perception’s fundamental representational function is to pick-out. The content of a per-<br>
ceptual state sets accuracy conditions and constitutes a <i>kind</i> of psychological state. <br>
Together with the perceptual modality (say, vision), the representational content is the <br>
perceptual-state kind that psychological explanations cite in their causal explanations of <br>
perception. The perceptual content <i>is</i> a perceptual-state kind, given the perceptual modal-<br>
ity. So differences in perceptual representational content constitute differences in kinds of <br>
psychological states. Differences in representational content vary with differences in states, <br>
even if the differences do not correspond to possible differences in the subject matter that <br>
renders perceptual states accurate or inaccurate.<br>
<br>
Among these differences are differences in focus or attention. One can switch attention <br>
in a small (say, foveated) part of a scene, keeping one’s eyes still, while holding many or <br>
perhaps even all the same objects in view and while seeing them as having the same prop-<br>
erties. Switches of attention do not <i>have</i> to change what is seen or the features that are <br>
attributed, though they commonly do.186 Such switches of attention, I think, inevitably <br><br>

usually does—change what attributives are used, by changing modes of presentation for the same attributes. For <br>
more on these matters, see Chapter 14.</div>
