500 Perceptual-Level Representation and Categorization</div>

receives sharpenings of the initial sketch-like representation that it supports from other <br>
sources: sources within IT and lower areas, as well as PHC—the main scene-gist area.<br>
<br>
A second type of cue, fed back from PFC and parietal areas, has come to seem perhaps <br>
more important than the whole-template cues, though most scientists think that both <br>
types of cues are employed.666 This second type is comprised of stored body-part and <br>
body-part-shape representations. For example, relevant to the super-ordinate category <br>
<i>animal</i>-<i>body</i>, there may be a sequence of iconic representations of part shapes that are <br>
diagnostic for specific types of animal-body: various types of head-body-part representa-<br>
tions; representations of eye-parts in head-body-parts; representations of mouth-shapes <br>
as parts of head-shapes; representations of limb-shape, and so on. These stored cue-<br>
representations are compared with the incoming super-ordinate representations. Results—<br>
possibly a range of probabilities for surviving candidates—are fed back to enhance <br>
whole-body cat egor iza tion representations, supported in IT.<br>
<br>
Cues from body-parts are suited for occlusion. Occlusion may leave some diagnostic <br>
body-parts visible. Such parts may be sufficiently comparable to a stored part-cue repre-<br>
sentation, according to some similarity criterion, to enhance categorization, even though <br>
much of the object’s shape is occluded. No one type of part-representation seems neces-<br>
sary to enhance more subordinate categorizations. A variety of types are fed back in mas-<br>
sively parallel fashion. The cues—templates of whole-body-types and of body-parts—are <br>
retentions from prior perception. They are stored perceptual attributives. Association of <br>
representations of beak-shaped-mouth body-parts with representations of bird-bodies is a <br>
synthesis among representations at the perceptual level.<br>
<br>
There is enhancement of very early visual processing that eventually leads to cat egor iza-<br>
tion—enhancement by part-shape and shape-aspect cues. Such cueing affects basic pro-<br>
cesses like figure-ground discrimination and binocular disparity, early in visual <br>
processing—well before 100 ms. Very early cues may be pre-perceptual, stored in percep-<br>
tual memory from perceptual learning, or stored as processing biases. Memories’ being <br>
stored in early visual areas and affecting early processing should help block the idea that <br>
effects of memory on processing are <i>ipso facto</i> cognitive effects.667 The cues may, but need <br>
not, have antecedent cognitive causes. Memories that affect early processing can come <br>
from simple priming mechanisms. (See Chapter 16, the section Priming and <br>
Memory.)<br>
<br>
Postulating cues from body-parts is often touted as helping to solve the problem of <br>
indefinite variety of visually identifiable shapes within a given category. Of course, the <br>
problem of variety arises even at the level of body-parts. There is a familiar trade-off <br>
between postulating prior representations in memory and postulating richer principles <br>
governing direct processing of input. Sharper distinction is needed, I think, between <br><br>
