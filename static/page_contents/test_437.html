Methodology for Finding Perceptual Attributives 437</div>
<br><br>
Our knowledge of boundaries of the perceptual system is nascent. Empirical work has, <br>
however, determined a fruitful distinction between processes that operate within a system <br>
of perception-formation and processes do not. There is a well-established core of types of <br>
attributive formed in the visual system. Advocates for recognizing new types of perceptual <br>
attributives must engage with the approaches that science uses to admit or exclude attribu-<br>
tives into the system.<br>
<br>
Let us reflect on relevant scientific considerations, both for and against taking a new <br>
candidate category of attributive to be perceptual—to be formed in a perceptual system.<br>
<br>
Evolutionary considerations are relevant. Representing certain attributes—say, caus-<br>
ation or agency—in fast, automatic ways may be an obvious evolutionary advantage. It is <br>
plausible that attributives for such attributes were formed over long time periods. <br>
Empirical disputes over whether attributives are perceptual often focus on attributives for <br>
such attributes. This consideration tends to act as a defeasible filter on candidates for being <br>
perceptual attributives. It cannot by itself show an attributive to be perceptual. A <i>concept</i> <br>
that applies to an attribute that is important to evolution could be formed in fast, auto-<br>
matic ways as well.<br>
<br>
Of course, it also cannot be assumed that all categories of perceptual attributives were <br>
formed in evolution, and are innate. Perceptual learning engenders huge numbers of <br>
 perceptual attributives. It could in principle establish new categories of perceptual attribu-<br>
tives. Can the visual system learn to attribute <i>cause</i>, <i>violin</i>, <i>knife</i>, <i>cancer</i>, <i>x-ray</i> <i>machine</i>, <br>
<i>recession</i>, or <i>scientist</i>? In some cases, apriori considerations count against a candidate attri-<br>
bution. In many cases, what is known about perceptual learning provides no encourage-<br>
ment. In some cases, the issue seems open.<br>
<br>
A reason for excluding a range of attributives is that formation of such attributives is <br>
not easily explainable as computational extensions from formation laws for known per-<br>
ceptual attributives. If there are too many uses, subject to too many auxiliary con sid er-<br>
ations, for occurrences in a range of attributives to be explained computationally, given <br>
what we now know, the attributive is a poor candidate for being perceptual. I discuss this <br>
point about computational explanation in some detail in Chapter 19, the section A <br>
Computational Model of Modularity.<br>
<br>
For example, in determining that there are perceptual attributives for <i>body</i>, it needed to <br>
be shown that such attributives can be formed on the basis of shape and motion attribu-<br>
tives, without recourse to abductive inferences that embed the concept bodyc. Of course, <br>
the perceptual capacity must be distinct from already accepted perceptual capacities to <br>
attribute environmental features that tend to co-occur with the <i>body</i> attribute. For <br>
ex ample, the perceptual capacity to attribute <i>body</i> is different from the perceptual capacity <br>
to attribute <i>generic shape</i>. If a system is to attribute <i>violin</i>, it must have capacities beyond <br>
capacities to attribute <i>violin-body</i>.<br>
<br>
If such additional capacities require propositional knowledge—involving <i>understanding</i> <br>
theory, the attributive is unlikely to be a perceptual attributive. Understanding theory is <br>
not a perceptual capacity, or a computationally tractable matter. If instances of an attribute <br>
are not perceivable, the attributive is a weak candidate. Although defeasible, these con sid-<br>
er ations serve as filters. There is no way to formulate this point in a sharp way. What <br>
counts as theory? What counts as being perceivable? Are magnifying instruments allowed? <br>
Still, the considerations have force. They carry a presumption against attributives like <br>
those for quarks, economic recessions, internal psychological states, and moral rectitude. <br>
They defeasibly count against visual perceptual attributives as of red for a blind person, </div>
