126 Some BaSicS aBout PercePtion and PercePtual SyStemS</div>
<br><br>
One can perceive an instance of color, misperceive it as a shade of brown, and misper-<br>
ceive it as brown. One cannot perceive a color-instance and not perceive it as an instance <br>
of the generic property <i>color</i>. One cannot perceive a color-instance and (mis)perceive it as <br>
a shape.<br>
<br>
It should not be thought that there is a single color-shade attributive for a given shade, <br>
or indeed a single attributive, color, for the property <i>color</i>. Being a perceptual-state kind <br>
requires being embedded in a system of states that constitute a perceptual constancy. Each <br>
kind of state that attributes a given color shade is associated with other kinds of states that <br>
attribute the same color shade, but in different ways. A perceptual state that attributes the <br>
shade under one type of illumination has different representational contents and different <br>
causal powers from those of a perceptual state that attributes the same shade under <br>
another illumination. One might generate action quicker than the other. (See Chapter 7, <br>
the section LinKage of Different PercePtual AttriButiveS in PercePtual <br>
ConStancieS.)<br>
<br>
An animal that attributes more than one color shade might be more confident in a <br>
generic attribution than in the specific one. The animal would be sensitive to error feed-<br>
back on the specific one in a much wider array of cases than on the more generic one. The <br>
animal might be caused to make a generic color attribution, even when it is sensitized so <br>
that it does not make the usual color-shade attribution, despite receiving a “look” of that <br>
color shade.<br>
<br>
Two ways of rejecting more generic perceptual attributives should be resisted. One is <br>
thinking that such attributives are “too abstract” for perception. Such thinking tends to <br>
derive from regarding all perception as occurring at the most attribute-specific level, and <br>
taking any abstraction to be conceptual. (See Chapter 19, the section The EmPiriciSt <br>
Model of PercePtion and Cognition: DegreeS of ABStraction.) This <br>
view is incompatible with scientific accounts. Perception can respond to attributes at vari-<br>
ous levels of abstraction. More abstract attributions are simply more inclusive, or more <br>
tolerant, groupings of attributes.<br>
<br>
Attribution of <i>brown</i> in addition to specific brown shades is a type of abstraction—<br>
in the sense that the <i>brown</i> attribution groups a band of brown-shades. Such abstrac-<br>
tion is grounded in selective grouping, in the perceiver’s responses, of more specific <br>
perceived shades.<br>
<br>
The capacity to attribute the genus <i>color</i> is not present in a system as product of se lect-<br>
ive grouping. It is present because of an architectural aspect of the perceptual system—a <br>
capacity to attribute colors. So the most generic attributive in a range is a built-in feature <br>
of the system, not a result of a specific grouping competence. A generic color attributive <br>
does not derive from taking the whole band of color shade attributes as equivalent in <br>
being colors, moving from the specific to the generic or abstract, or any other operation <br>
on other representations. A generic attributive, which is a definite generic perceptual <br>
competence—a color competence—, is a capacity for color representation, a capacity that <br>
can be exercised veridically or not. Attributives just are representational capacities to char-<br>
acterize attributes, veridically or not.<br>
<br>
The other source of resistance to recognizing generic attributives is the idea that it is <br>
implausible that the system has different computational symbols for the most specific <br>
attributives (maximally specific shade-of-brown attributives), for intermediate attributives <br>
(attributives of <i>brown</i>), and for most-generic attributives (color). This way of thinking is </div>
