must be able to tell which individuals are threats—both among potential predators (adults <br>
versus babies) and among allies (mothers versus fathers, allies in the social hierarchy ver-<br>
sus opponents). Such discrimination requires fine-grained distinctions cued by spatial <br>
properties. Categorization requires discounting differences in perspective that do not bear <br>
on objective environmental differences. For example, a perceptual system must determine <br>
whether a proximal stimulus that occupies relatively few of the receptors derives from a <br>
smaller body or a larger body that is not as close. This task, involving size, shape, and dis-<br>
tance constancies, is central to the perceptual categorization. It requires discounting dif-<br>
ferences in proximal stimulation to respond to similarities in environmental attributes. So, <br>
crudely speaking, the first task requires fine discriminations. The second requires cutting <br>
through differences to find commonalities.<br>
<br>
A little reflection shows that fulfilling the first task <i>for a perceptual system</i> presupposes <br>
fulfilling the second. Of course, a non-perceptual sensory system could distinguish pred-<br>
ators from allies by types of differences in proximal stimulation—jerky versus smooth <br>
motion as registered on the retina, unfamiliar versus familiar olfaction. Insofar as the sys-<br>
tem represents particulars and attributes in the environment, it must exercise perceptual <br>
constancies.<br>
<br>
Further reflection shows that the second task is the biggest part of carrying out the first. <br>
The second task is likely to require more reticulated psychological equipment than that <br>
needed to add the first task to the second. The first task requires sensitivity to differences <br>
among individuals within a kind (one dog-shaped dog-body versus another) and sensitiv-<br>
ity to different sub-kinds within a larger kind (beagle-shaped beagle-bodies versus spaniel-<br>
shaped spaniel-bodies). The second requires grouping proximal stimuli that derive from a <br>
given kind, sub-kind, or individual.<br>
<br>
For any given individual or sub-kind, there is a massive number of types of proximal <br>
stimuli that regularly derive from the same individual or sub-kind. For example, there are <br>
multitudes of different possible translations—that is, shifts of the same configuration to a <br>
different part of the retina—for each individual and sub-kind type.<br>
<br>
There are also many possible rotations in depth for each irregularly shaped individual <br>
or sub-kind. There are numerous possible scalings of a retinal image—that is, rigid trans-<br>
form ations in image size—that might derive from near or distant perspective on a given <br>
entity. These are just the most prominent geometrical variations in an image that can <br>
derive from different visual perspectives on a given particular or specific kind.99 There are <br>
vastly more visual perspectives on individuals and kinds—corresponding to different dis-<br>
tances and orientations—than there are individuals and kinds. So the task of cutting <br>
through differences in perspective—deriving from differences in proximal stimuli coming <br>
from a given <i>representatum—</i>is impressive.<br>
<br>
Space-relevant invariances can show up at both pre-perceptual and perceptual levels of <br>
processing. Take translation. Translation is an invariance that treats similar patterns that <br>
might occur at different positions in the retinal image as equivalent. The same, or similar, <br>
pattern is grouped as equivalent and responded to behaviorally in similar ways. Changes <br>
of position on the retina of an otherwise equivalent proximal stimulus are registered pre-<br>
perceptually. Motion of a coherent entity can be pre-perceptually registered by directional <br><br>
