The converse of differentiation, <i>unitization</i>, is a further type of perceptual learning <br>
mechanism. Chunking often results from learning to associate perceived features that <br>
often occur together. Fast perception and recognition of familiar faces—instances or <br>
types—owes much to unitization. Face learning is the most studied type of learning to <br>
group spatial features. Such grouping regularly yields more accurate representations of <br>
familiar combinations of features.988<br>
<br>
Perceptual learning contributes to most perceptual categorization, except perhaps some <br>
categorizations that are innate and the immediate products of the initial feed-forward pro-<br>
cessing. Not only perceptual recognition of specific category-instances, but perceptual <br>
representation of all category-types is informed by perceptual learning retained in long-<br>
term perceptual memory.<br>
<br>
Learning spatial properties and spatial relations grounds memory-dependent cat egor-<br>
iza tion and use of scene gist in enhancing categorization. Thus learned templates of shapes <br>
of whole bodies and shapes of diagnostic body-parts enhance categorization. Learned cue <br>
combinations and diagnostic cues speed and consolidate perceptual categorization.989<br>
<br>
These points yield further reason to take perceptual categorization, and perceptual memories <br>
that facilitate it, to be perceptual-level. Learning shape-image templates, shape-parts, and differ-<br>
entiations and combinations of features are certainly perceptual-level. Memories that figure in, <br>
or retain products of, such learning, are perceptual-level. When such learning and memory sta-<br>
bilizes, renders more reliable, or increases resolution of perceptual categorizations produced by <br>
dominantly feed-forward processing, the enriched categorization remains perceptual.<br>
<br>
Moreover, mechanisms of perceptual learning bear none of the signs of propositional <br>
reasoning, or any other process that is more sophisticated than perceptual processing <br>
itself. We lack an adequate understanding of the forms of perceptual learning. Some are as <br>
simple as brute association. Others are bound up in perceptual categorization and other <br>
processes that are informed by perceptual constancies. There is no reason to think that any <br>
mechanisms in perceptual learning are more sophisticated than mechanisms involved in <br>
formation of perceptions. Mechanisms that underlie attention weighting, imprinting, dif-<br>
ferentiation, and unitization are certainly not more sophisticated than most types of per-<br>
ceptual processing, although, of course, they commonly operate on <i>products</i> of perceptual <br>
processing.990 Some perceptual processes themselves operate on the products of <br><br>

<b>FOOTNOTES</b><br>
<b>Cont FN</b>As with categorization, one must take care not to over-intellectualize a learned perceptual attributive. Some have <br>
thought that racial types are attributed in perception, or at least that background knowledge about race affects <br>
perception of shape or color. ‘Knowledge’ is a typical hyper-intellectualization. What is most likely to be operating <br>
is low-level grouping of shape-type, or association of shape-type with color-type, together with some sense of <br>
relative familiarity or otherness of given types. The last-cited article describes such a case in what I think are <br>
broadly correct terms.<br>
