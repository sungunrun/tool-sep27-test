The Issue of Cognitive Penetration 679</div>
<br><br>
MacPherson proposes possible mechanisms that <i>might</i> yield effects on visual processing. <br>
They have not been shown to yield such effects in the relevant cases. It has not even been <br>
shown that either belief or imagining plays any role at all in the example. MacPherson <br>
claims to argue only that the mechanism is possible. But in responding to possible replies, <br>
she defends the view that the mechanism is actual. No one doubts that such a mechanism <br>
is epistemically possible. There is, however, no reason to believe that it is the mechanism <br>
that grounds that experimental result.1107<br>
<br>
MacPherson rebuts two possible doubts that the mechanism that she cites operates in <br>
the experiment. According to one, the subjects’ experiences of the orange cutouts are <br>
accurate and the same regardless of the shape, but their judgments are off. According to <br>
the other, the subjects misperceive the color, but the misperception is explained without <br>
appeal to cognitive penetration.<br>
<br>
I am not convinced by MacPherson’s arguments against the first strategy. However, I <br>
think that there is evidence that the biases displayed in the experiments are at least partly <br>
perceptual. So I do not dwell on the first strategy. Her arguments against the second have, <br>
I think, no force at all.<br>
<br>
MacPherson aptly raises the following consideration to support the second strategy, <br>
before trying to refute it. Suppose that visual systems have different color responses when <br>
individuals see cutouts of shapes of normally red objects than when they see cutouts of <br>
shapes of objects that are not normally red. Might the different responses be caused by <br>
non-cognitive influences? She suggests, on behalf of doubters, that the response of ‘the <br>
early visual system’ might occur ‘in accordance with associationist principles, so that it is <br>
past exposure to a certain shape having a certain colour that has altered the way the visual <br>
system processes that shape’s colour’.1108<br>
<br>
This is an empirically plausible suggestion. How does MacPherson counter it? She insists <br>
that beliefs that most heart-shaped objects are red must be causing the difference and thereby <br>
penetrating the visual system. She adds that the concept red gets primed when one has an <br>
experience as of a heart-shaped object. Then the primed cognitive state penetrates the visual <br>
system. She further maintains (plausibly) that categorization of things as apples, presumably <br>
considered as natural kinds, is cognitive, not product of the visual system. So, she concludes, <br>
the effect of such categorization on visual responses is cognitive penetration.<br>
<br>
These responses never come to grips with the issue that she aptly raises. It has not been <br>
shown, nor is it plausible, that a state that represents the natural kind <i>apple</i> as such plays <br>
the key role in an association that produces perceptual bias. <i>Any</i> state that associated the <br>
relevant shape with the relevant color would have the effect. Looked at in detail, apples are <br>
shaped differently from other common bodies in the environment. More crucially, it is not <br>
clear that any <i>belief</i>, even a belief about association of certain shapes (that are in fact the <br>
shapes of apples) with certain colors, plays a role. MacPherson assumes what needs to be <br><br>
