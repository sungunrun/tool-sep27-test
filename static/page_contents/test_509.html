Form of Relatively Primitive Conative States 509</div>

command states further guide the action. Conative states not only set targets and initiate <br>
action. They guide action as it unfolds.<br>
<br>
At the psychological level at issue, such states are non-propositional analogs of an <br>
intention. An instance of a motor command—the non-propositional analog of an <br>
intention-in-action—can cause an action.681 Since content is a capacity or capacity-<br>
exercise, motor capacities naturally match the visual and proprioceptive capacities that <br>
guide them, by characterizing targets and means to targets. So the form and content of <br>
motor commands naturally matches those of visual and proprioceptive representations. <br>
Like perceptual representational content, lower-level conative states’ content has the form <br>
of a noun phrase governed by a context-dependent referential determiner. Referential <br>
applications of such determiners apply <i>de re</i> to future actions that realize the content of <br>
the conative state. For example, a state could, omitting temporal representation, have the <br>
mode and content:<br><br>
Action-Target: (that x1)(that x2)(that x3)[grippingg1(i)(x1), bodyd3(i)(x2), handu1(i)(x3), <br>
<br>
ofi7(c)(x1, x2), byz3(c)(x1, x3)]<br><br>
The conative representation uses both vision (bodyd3) and proprioception (handu1, <br>
grippingg1).<br>
<br>
The first referential application (marked by subscript ‘1’) is to a future, anticipated <br>
action that is under the control of the agent. This application is likely either to be shared <br>
with or to feed an indexed memory file that connects an anticipatory representational <br>
state and the conative state that sets the target. In a representation as of a target, this appli-<br>
cation can, of course, fail to pick out a referent, if the action is not consummated. <br>
Anticipatory representations as of actions can be schematic, although they do not <br>
have to be.<br>
<br>
The referential application marked by subscript ‘2’ and the guiding attributive bodyd3 <br>
apply to the target-object (to be gripped). The referential application and the attributive <br>
are borrowed from the visual system. That is, this conative state is formed from a short-<br>
term perceptual memory of, or from an ongoing visual perception of, a relevant body.<br>
<br>
The attributives, grippingg1 and handd3, guiding the first and third referential applica-<br>
tions, respectively, are borrowed from proprioception. Visual attribution can also contrib-<br>
ute if hand and grip are in view during the action. Ofi7, and byz3 come from either vision <br>
or proprioception. Maybe the conative system produces attributives for actions and <br>
action-relations: <i>gripping</i>, <i>of</i>, <i>by</i>. I conjecture, however, that all its attributives are taken <br>
from vision, proprioception, or other perceptual systems.<br>
<br>
The representational form just illustrated is, of course, a radical over-simplification. <br>
I omit spatio-temporal mapping. I omit the iconic format of the attributives’ content. It is <br><br>

<b>FOOTNOTES</b><br>
<b>FN</b>681 The notion of intention-in-action derives from J. Searle, <i>Intentionality</i> (Cambridge: Cambridge University <br>
Press, 1983), 83–98. Philosophical argument that propositional-level intention affects action via non-conceptual <br>
motor commands is advanced by E. Pacherie, ‘The Phenomenology of Action: A Conceptual Framework’, <br>
<i>Cognition</i> 107 (2008), 179–217; and E. Pacherie, ‘Nonconceptual Representations for Action and the Limits of <br>
Intentional Control’, <i>Social Psychology</i> 42 (2011), 67–73. Pacherie argues in the latter paper that motor commands <br>
must be non-conceptual and non-propositional. I do not find the argument persuasive. However, ex plana tory <br>
practice of perceptual-motor psychology solidly supports the conclusion. Pacherie also seems to argue that the <br>
contents of motor commands are not borrowed from perception. Such a view would be clearly mistaken. The last <br>
perceptual-level motor commands are usually proprioceptive.</div>
