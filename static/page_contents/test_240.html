240 Attributives, Referential Applications in Constancies</div>
<br><br>
Perhaps there are closer parallels between pairs of conceptual or linguistic attributives <br>
and pairs of perceptual attributives linked in a perceptual constancy. I think it suggestive <br>
that finding such parallels is not easy. The features of a perceptual constancy that I have <br>
been highlighting are natural corollaries of the fact that perception always represents <br>
iconically from a specific changeable perspective, usually a perspective marked by a co ord-<br>
in ate system anchored at a particular spatial position. Perceptual representational contents, <br>
hence the perceptual states themselves, embody how perceived entities are presented to the <br>
perceiver from the perceiver’s specific vantage point.<br>
<br>
Perceptual attributives represent occluded entities, at different depths and directions, <br>
with specific shadow and lighting characteristics, with different degrees of focus. These <br>
conditions for viewing determine aspects of representational content. They yield different <br>
psychological states. Yet the focus of perception is on particulars and their attribute-types. <br>
They are what primarily matter for an animal’s needs and action targets. The attributes do <br>
not vary with viewing position or stimulus conditions. So both the very specific, vantage-<br>
point-dependent way that environmental attributes are presented and those attributes <br>
themselves are marked in the representational contents of perceptual states—hence in the <br>
perceptual-state kinds themselves.<br>
<br>
Linguistic meaning and some concepts can take into account the position of the speaker. <br>
Indexicals like ‘here’ function to do that job. Their analogs in perception are egocentric <br>
indexes that anchor spatial or temporal coordinate systems. The meaning of ‘here’ and the <br>
representational content of unapplied egocentric indexes (like ego-here) stay constant <br>
across contexts. Most word meanings (for example, rectangular) do not depend sys tem at-<br>
ic al ly on the spatial vantage point of a speaker. Most perceptual representational contents <br>
(say, those for <i>rectangular</i>) vary with stimulus conditions and perceiver vantage point.<br>
<br>
Part of what it is to be a linguistic symbol is to have meaning and use that abstracts <br>
from any specific vantage point of use. Linguistic symbols are re-useable tools for different <br>
speakers and for the same speaker on different occasions, regardless of what spatial pos-<br>
ition the speaker occupies.<br>
<br>
By contrast, a stimulus-specific perspective on a <i>representatum</i> is part of the nature of <br>
most representational elements in perceptions and many drawings. Most perceptions’ <br>
attributives, their freely repeatable modes of presentation of perceived entities, are per-<br>
spective-and stimulus-dependent. They depend on and vary with the proximal stimula-<br>
tion received on a given occasion.<br>
<br>
Morphemes and many concepts are <i>primitives</i> in the sense that they lack internal gram-<br>
matical or logical structure. A common understanding of such primitives is that their <br>
semantics entails nothing about any other primitive at the same level of abstraction. All <br>
linked perceptual attributives, while differing from one another, share a common semanti-<br>
cal feature. All contain internal structure. It is coded into the competencies themselves <br>
that they all indicate and attribute a specific attribute, while differing from one another. <br>
Thus each perceptual attributive bears semantical entailment relations to others at the <br>
same level of abstraction. On the cited understanding of ‘primitive’, ordinary perceptual <br>
attributives are not primitives, although they are not complexes of other perceptual <br>
attributives.<br>
<br>
<i>Different</i> attributives linked in a perceptual constancy are connected in law-like ways. <br>
There is a law-like relation between the way rectangularity is presented straight-on and the <br>
way it is presented at a specific slant, or partly occluded. Thus it is important not to </div>
