<b>Two Misguided Ways of Thinking About Perceptual Constancies<br><br>
</div>
</b>I emphasize that we obtain little insight from armchair reflection about what a perceptual <br>
constancy has to be. An oral challenge to my view that perceptual constancies are not <br>
prominent, or perhaps even present, in olfactory sensing went as follows. Suppose that <br>
one smells coffee in a coffee shop. Then one walks to a cheese store. Despite the prevalence <br>
of proximal stimulations emanating from cheese, one can smell the coffee in a coffee cup <br>
in the cheese store. The proximal stimulations that one receives in the coffee shop are “sig-<br>
nificantly different” from those that one receives in the cheese shop. So one has olfactory <br>
perceptual constancies for coffee smells.<br>
<br>
I believe that there is little reason to give weight to this offhand example. One must look <br>
to how olfactory science explains the case. It is plausible that the explanation of our ability <br>
to smell coffee in the cheese shop appeals purely to strength of registration of proximal <br>
stimulation in olfactory sensors—proximal stimulation that derives from chemical struc-<br>
tures in the coffee—and from learned templates of past sensings of coffee. Despite pres-<br>
ence of registrations of cheese smells, the strength, or proportion, of coffee registration <br>
reaches a threshold that allows sensing the coffee. Colloquially, the difference in proximal <br>
stimulation is “significant”. But enough of the same registrations in the two contexts likely <br>
remains to allow a similar response to the coffee smell. It is not obvious that the best causal <br>
explanation appeals to perceptual constancies.62<br>
<br>
No perceptual psychologist would take this armchair example in itself to exhibit an <br>
olfactory perceptual constancy. It may just illustrate a non-perceptual invariant in smell. <br>
To understand perceptual constancies, hence to understand the non-perceptual-sensing/<br>
perceptual-sensing distinction, one must look to causal explanations in perceptual <br>
science.63<br>
<br>
In seeking perceptual constancies, one should reflect on whether perceptual psychology <br>
invokes states with veridicality conditions in the science’s causal explanations. One should <br>
distinguish functional explanation that connects a sensory state to the distal environment, <br>
without taking the state to have veridicality conditions, from causal explanation that <br>
appeals to representational sensory states that set accuracy conditions. Suppose that the <br>
science does not appeal to sensory states with veridicality conditions that represent distal <br>
stimuli in its causal explanations of the formation of such states and of behavior guided by <br>
such states. One should then probably infer that the causal explanations of both sensory-<br>
state formation and individual behavior are sufficient. Even causal explanations of <br>
sensory-state formation that do not attribute representational states almost inevitably fea-<br>
ture equivalence-groupings of proximal stimuli—non-perceptual invariances. The invari-<br>
ances are registrational, but not perceptual.<br>
<br>
If the correct account of the coffee-smell case does not invoke perceptual constancies or <br>
states with veridicality conditions, causal explanations can still be satisfying. Non-<br>
representational sensory states grouped in such a way as to require sufficiently strong <br>
odor-registrations that correspond sufficiently well with coffee stimuli could explain both <br>
behavior and our judgments regarding sensory similarity and regarding connection <br><br>
