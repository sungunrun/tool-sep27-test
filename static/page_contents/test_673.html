quite abstract. (See Chapter 4, the section Taxonomic Hierarchies in <br>
Perception.) Perceptual memory is no more abstract than the perceptual attributive <br>
content that it retains. Visual perceptual memory that lasts longer than visual sensory <br>
memory is less rich than perception. The difference consists in loss of perceptual content, <br>
not abstraction from it. (See this chapter, the section The Empiricist Model of <br>
Perception and Cognition: Degrees of Abstraction.)<br>

Jacob Beck develops the inference from being non-perceptual and representational to <br>
being cognitive. He relies on the idea that cognition is not directly stimulus dependent, <br>
whereas perception is. He takes the distinction between perception and cognition to <br>
depend on a specific type of stimulus dependence. Beck’s proposal is that<br><br>
(Beck)  X is perceptual if, necessarily, all occurrences of all elements of X have the function <br>
<br>
of being stimulus-dependent—that is, being causally sustained by present proximal <br>
<br>
stimulation; otherwise X is cognitive.1101<br><br>
The proposal elaborates a useful sense of stimulus dependence. But again, the proposal <br>
counts visual sensory memory and trans-saccadic memory as cognition. It counts all per-<br>
ceptual memory involved in perceptual priming as cognition. (See Chapter 16, the section <br>
Priming and Memory.) This consequence is clearly unacceptable. Visual sensory <br>
memory depends almost entirely on the fact that physically grounded systems preserve <br>
the impact of proximal stimulation over short periods of time. Trans-saccadic memory’s <br>
keeping perception going through eye blinks is another removal from the “here and now” <br>
that cannot plausibly be counted cognition. These forms of memory, in fact all forms of <br>
perceptual memory, contain only perceptual attributives and involve operations that are <br>
<i>more primitive</i> than many of those involved in perceptual processing. (See Chapters <br>
16–17.) Perceptual memory is not in any sense higher-level or more knowledge-like than <br>
perception.<br>
<br>
The basic problem with the proposal lies in the inference that drives the enterprise—<br>
taking perception and cognition to be exhaustive aspects of the mind. One cannot infer <br>
that a representational state is cognitive from its not being a perceptual state.<br>
<br>
One could try to rule out very short-term types of memory from being cognitive by <br>
taking cognitive states to have a function to be stimulus-independent for <i>prolonged</i> <br>
 periods of time. Such a move is not motivated by any deep principle for distinguishing <br>
psy cho logic al kinds. The counter-example of very short-term memory is intended just to <br>
be vivid. Similar points apply to perceptual aspects of working memory and long-<br>
term memory.<br>
<br>
Perceptual learning does not function to be causally sustained by present proximal <br>
stimulation. Even where ‘cognition’ is thrown around loosely in vision science, no vision <br>
scientist counts perceptual learning cognitive.<br><br>
