218 Attributives, Referential Applications in Constancies</div>

Color representation does not factor so simply into representations for color and il lu-<br>
min ation. Differences in illumination are certainly informationally registered in visual <br>
systems. However, it is known that color is not computable from luminance (the overall <br>
effect on the retina of the mix of reflectance and illumination) and illumination. Color and <br>
lightness representation are not merely matters of subtracting or factoring out il lu min-<br>
ation from luminance.210 They depend on the ensemble of surfaces in the scene.211 Color <br>
representation cannot be factored into a canonical representation of a color and a single <br>
canonical representation of an illumination. It is not even known that registration or rep-<br>
resentation of illumination is used in color representation. Some scientists think that <br>
regis tra tion or representation of illumination may be computed separately, so that though <br>
color constancy requires constancy through different luminances with different il lu min-<br>
ations, the computation mechanisms that yield color constancy would not involve compu-<br>
tation of illumination.212 What is clear is that different illumination is a factor in producing <br>
an aspect of how a color appears or is presented—the modes of presentation of color <br>
attributives.<br>
<br>
The status of perceptual systems’ relation to illumination is itself a delicate matter. It has <br>
not been standard to take perception as exhibiting illumination constancies. On the other <br>
hand, research on sensitivity to illumination is in its early stages. Vision is clearly more <br>
oriented to surface color than to illumination. Biological needs hinge more on detailed <br>
and specific discrimination of the former than the latter.213 But registering illumination <br>
could matter for such enterprises as registering time of day and perhaps upcoming <br>
weather. Gross differences in lightness can easily be discerned by opening one’s eyes, even <br>
while squinting. For these purposes, specific illumination need not be represented. Non-<br>
perceptual sensory registration suffices.<br>
<br>
There is work relevant to whether there are illumination constancies.214 In this work, <br>
experiments vary surface reflectances and test whether subjects can discern overall il lu-<br>
min ation differences. The model obviously maintains a constant attribute (illumination) <br>
under significant variation in proximal stimulation (deriving from different reflectances). <br>
What has been found is that subjects can discern fairly subtle global differences in il lu-<br>
min ation if surfaces are held constant. They are poor but above chance in discerning dif-<br>
ferences if reflectances are varied. This means that relatively broad variances of <br>
illumination are responded to in the same way. There is some evidence that the visual <br><br>
