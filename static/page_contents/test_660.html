conform to what might be thought of as tenets of “rationality” ’. He cites one or two cases <br>
(such as amodal completion) in which he thinks an operation is ‘orthogonal to <br>
rationality’.1072<br>
<br>
Pylyshyn’s discussions of semantic coherence, logical connection, rationality, and mak-<br>
ing sense are deeply unclear. They provide no scientific guide to dealing with issues that he <br>
raises. Like Fodor, Pylyshyn was interested in understanding <i>computation</i>. Although he <br>
thinks, plausibly, that not just any causal influence from beliefs on early vision counts as <br>
penetration, his vague, metaphorical requirements on what counts as a relevant “way” <br>
need sharpening.<br>
<br>
Perhaps because of Pylyshyn’s unclarity about such requirements, many critics laid <br>
aside his remarks about making semantic sense and conforming to tenets of rationality. <br>
They interpreted them as merely ruling out arbitrary or pathological incursions into a sys-<br>
tem. Most took any non-pathological causal influence by “cognition” on visual processing <br>
to count as cognitive penetration. I believe that this turn in the discussion degraded its <br>
interest.<br>
<br>
Pylyshyn’s characterizations cognition are no clearer than his characterization of pene-<br>
tra tion. His explications of ‘cognition’ vary. He takes cognition to be constituted by an <br>
organism’s ‘goals and beliefs’, or ‘beliefs, expectations, values, and so on’, or ‘beliefs and utili-<br>
ties’, or ‘knowledge’.1073 He does not clarify what count as goals, expectations, utilities, or <br>
knowledge. For example, he does not clarify whether goals must have propositional con-<br>
tent. Are all conative states to count as cognition or only some? If only some, which ones?<br>
<br>
Although Pylyshyn does not say so explicitly, he appears to take cognition to operate at <br>
a relatively high level of a psychology, possibly propositional attitude psychology. I think it <br>
likely that Pylyshyn regarded relevant goals, utilities, and expectations as propositional. <br>
His association of cognition with belief and knowledge suggests propositional in ter pret-<br>
ations. On the other hand, he sometimes assumes that knowledge is present in a psych-<br>
ology on very thin grounds—grounds that do not at all support presence of such <br>
propositional attitudes as belief.<br>
<br>
Nearly all discussions of the penetration issue follow Pylyshyn in skating quickly over <br>
the question of exactly what counts as cognition, and why. Many examples of cognitive <br>
penetration cite factors that are neither beliefs nor propositional goals. Frequently, it <br>
appears that cognition is taken to be any representational state or process that is not a <br>
perception.<br><br>

Pylyshyn takes being logically connected to involve a state’s having access to any other state that bears a de duct-<br>
ive logical relation to its content, although Pylyshyn is not precise about what he means by ‘deductive’. The view <br>
does express his focus on computational relations. Pylyshyn illuminatingly distinguishes two models. The first <br>
derives from Marr, <i>Vision</i>. It takes perceptual operations to be constraints on processing, where the contents of <br>
the operations are not <i>represented</i> in the system. The second derives from New Look Psychology. It takes percep-<br>
tual operations to be a sequence of believed hypotheses unconsciously represented in the system. See Pylyshyn, <br>
‘Is Vision Continuous with Cognition? The Case for Cognitive Impenetrability of Visual Perception’, 344–345, <br>
353–357. The “constraint” model has been relied upon in mainstream vision science since Marr. The New Look <br>
model has no influence in mainstream vision science. See also Chapter 4, the section Principles Governing <br>
Transitions Contrasted with Representational Contents. A perceptual system does not “make <br>
sense” of its input in the way that individuals make sense of evidence by forming hypothetical beliefs. However, <br>
most operations of the visual system do “make sense” for scientists observing how the system works.<br>
