Conceptions of Penetration 687</div>
<br><br>
Before pursuing these points, I discuss two philosophical specifications of a cognitive <br>
penetration relation that try to amplify what Fodor or Pylyshyn says on the matter. Both <br>
specifications cite relations that are more restrictive than mere non-pathological, law-like <br>
causal relations between cognitive states and perceptual states or processes.<br>
<br>
Wayne Wu proposes to explicate or amplify Fodor’s notion of encapsulation, and then use it <br>
to criticize Fodor’s view on encapsulation. He takes the quoted passage to postulate a “firewall” <br>
between a module and psychological mechanisms outside it. I think this metaphor unfortu-<br>
nate. Fodor’s first way of being encapsulated suggests this metaphor. The second does not.1127<br>
<br>
Wu goes on to argue that intentions, which he takes to be cognitive states, penetrate <br>
vision. To simplify the account to its gist: A certain constancy in vision—stability of the <br>
physical world despite eye movements that shift the retinal image—depends on corollary <br>
discharge from the motor command to visual trans-saccadic memory. The memory pro-<br>
duces an anticipated retinal image that is compared with the actual retinal image after the <br>
saccadic eye movement. If the discrepancy between anticipated image and actual image is <br>
high, the object is perceived as moving. If the discrepancy is low, the object is perceived as <br>
stable. (See Chapter 16, Transaccadic Memory.) Wu imagines a case in which one’s <br>
eye movements, hence the corollary discharge, the anticipations, and the perceptual attri-<br>
butions are influenced by intentions to find answers to questions about a picture. If a sub-<br>
ject is asked to describe the clothing worn by people in the picture, the eyes move in a <br>
pattern influenced by intentions to follow the instructions.<br>
<br>
Wu takes the subjects’ intentions to penetrate the motor system’s commands. Since <br>
(plausibly and in agreement with Fodor) he takes the motor commands to be part of a <br>
computational visuo-motor system, he concludes that the visuo-motor system is pene-<br>
trated by cognitive states—the subjects’ intentions.1128<br>
<br>
Wu recognizes that the relation between the intentions and visual processing is “in dir-<br>
ect”. It goes through motor commands, which are perceptual-level—below the level of <br>
intentions. Intentions are taken to be propositional states, or at any rate states with concep-<br>
tual content, on the same representational level as beliefs. So the effect of the intentions on <br>
visual processing is mediated through sub-cognitive motor commands. In defending his <br>
view that this indirect causal relation constitutes cognitive penetration, Wu states con-<br>
straints that he thinks “flesh out” Fodor’s explication of encapsulation from cognitive <br>
influence. These constraints are supposed to be tighter than those in (MP), and more faith-<br>
ful to an emphasis on computation.<br>
<br>
The first constraint is called the ‘Computation Condition’:<br><br>
(CC)  The influence of capacity <i>Y</i> in visual processing <i>V</i> of visual content <i>p</i> makes the vis-<br>
<br>
ual content intelligible due to the visual computations that underwrite content <i>p</i> <br>
<br>
using information in <i>Y</i> as a resource.<br><br>

<b>FOOTNOTES</b><br>
<b>FN</b>1127 Wu, ‘Visual Spatial Constancy and Modularity: Does Intention Penetrate Vision?’, 648. Wu further writes, <br>
‘Fodor’s concern was specifically whether <i>cognitive</i> databases appropriately influence perceptual systems’. <br>
Although Wu remarks here that the influence must be “appropriate” in order to be a concern for Fodor, it would <br>
have been more natural to say that Fodor’s concern was whether cognitive contents are in the database for com-<br>
putation. Wu’s more detailed explication of a penetration relation loses connection with computation altogether.<br>
<br>
<b>FN</b>1128 Wu does not tailor his argument to Pylyshyn’s conception of early vision. Attributions that depend on sac-<br>
cades are beyond the first computation of motion and 3-D volume shapes, computation that does not depend on <br>
eye movement. Pylyshyn characterizes early vision functionally, not in terms of a time course or a stage of process-<br>
ing. I think that relevant computations of position and motion would count for Pylyshyn as part of early vision.</div>
