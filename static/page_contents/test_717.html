which could seem “perceptually dissimilar”. They could be perceptually grouped into a <br>
single application base, through learning or evolution, because of consistent association <br>
with eating.<br>
<br>
Causal relations are not known to be beyond the reach of perceptual attributives. It is <br>
likely that some are attributed perceptually. (See Chapter 12.) It is likely that perceptual <br>
attributions of weight, size, hardness of bodies are associated with perceptual anticipation <br>
of a body’s cracking a nut, where a cracking is perceived as an instance of collision <br>
causation.<br>
<br>
Although biological <i>growing</i> may occur too slowly—or be too much a natural kind <br>
determined by underlying biological structure—to be tracked perceptually, other increases <br>
in size are certainly represented perceptually. Moreover, spatial relations between entities of <br>
one type (fruit-body) and entities of another type (tree-body) are known to be attributed <br>
in perceptual systems. Perceptual memories formed from perceptions of types of entities <br>
in typical spatial relations are commonplace.<br>
<br>
The idea that one can determine that attributives for functions, causal relations, or spa-<br>
tial relations are non-perceptual and part of conceptual knowledge purely by regarding <br>
them as “non-obvious” is out of touch with the methodology of perceptual psychology—<br>
the most powerful psychological science. Intuitive ideas of perceptual similarity are a poor <br>
basis for determining what attributives are formed in a perceptual system. By intuitive <br>
standards of similarity, many generic bodies are perceptually very dissimilar from one <br>
another. Intuitive judgments of perceptual similarity are modern implementations of the <br>
old empiricist idea that percepts are concrete and concepts are abstract. That idea is scien-<br>
tifically untenable.<br>
<br>
I cite another example. In maintaining that non-human animals do not form represen-<br>
tations for unobservables, Jennifer Vonk and Daniel Povinelli write,<br><br>
. . . it is possible to construct categories whose members are visually dissimilar and yet are <br>
<br>
linked by virtue of an abstract construct that itself is not directly observable, as in the case <br>
<br>
of a category of items that are related by their function, not by the fact that they look, <br>
<br>
smell, feel, sound, or taste alike (e.g. categories such as “things that make good gifts” or <br>
<br>
“things that attract romantic partners”). In such cases it would be difficult to understand <br>
<br>
the conceptual fabric bringing the various category members together without a notion <br>
<br>
about constructs that cannot be directly perceived through the senses.1168<br><br>
Here, the confused idea is that one cannot “directly” perceive a function, so any represen-<br>
tation of function is conceptual. The issue is not whether one can perceive a “construct” or <br>
category or function, but whether one can perceptually attribute a functional property, on <br>
the basis of perception of instances of the property. The authors in effect assume that one <br>
cannot perceptually attribute a function to particulars grouped by their function. The <br>
assumption is unsupported. One cannot rule out, from the armchair, there being percep-<br>
tual attributives for gifts or mates. An ape (or bird) could group a variety of types of food, <br>
toys, or ornaments, as attractive for another ape (or bird), having noticed what types of <br><br>
