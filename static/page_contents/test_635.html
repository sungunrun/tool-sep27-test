Perceptual Anticipation 635</div>
<br><br>
Conditioning mechanisms yield anticipatory representation that does not operate off <br>
nearly concurrent perception. With prior conditioning, smooth pursuit movements occur <br>
before the onset of object motion. For example, with regularly repeated presentation of <br>
motion stimuli—for an object moving from a stationary location at a constant velocity—<br>
smooth-pursuit eye movements of up to 30 degrees per second <i>precede</i> the onset of stimuli <br>
from object motion.1006<br>
<br>
In an elegant experiment, Barnes, Grealy, and Collins compared smooth pursuit onset <br>
when individuals tracked moving objects with their eyes with smooth pursuit onset when <br>
individuals kept their eyes fixed while an object was seen to move. They reasoned that a <br>
feedback loop involving efference copy could not build up a representation of eye velocity <br>
during fixation. If, however, the perceptual representation is retained and combined with <br>
memory of information about velocity, an anticipatory representation could be developed <br>
without using efferent copy. Experiment found that without fixation, smooth pursuit <br>
movement was initiated on the first presentation of the motion, only after motion onset. <br>
With repeated presentations of the motion, anticipatory smooth pursuit of movement <br>
occurred. However, and significantly, if a motion was presented three times in the fixation <br>
condition, subjects were immediately able to make anticipatory smooth pursuit eye move-<br>
ments, when they were first allowed to move their eyes. These movements had a peak <br>
velocity equal to that of the third response without previous fixation.1007 Thus information <br>
regarding velocity of a moving entity is stored and used to produce anticipatory responses <br>
in the absence of eye movement. The efferent copy mechanism is not the only mechanism <br>
for generating anticipatory representation of motion.<br>
<br>
It was later shown that individuals can control this mechanism. Individuals can scale speed <br>
and direction of anticipatory smooth-pursuit eye movements from <i>symbolic</i> pre-cues.1008<br>
<br>
Both the efferent copy mechanism and the conditioned memory-storage mechanism <br>
require only brief exposure (50–100 ms) to motion. So memory storage and anticipatory <br>
representation can derive from very short exposure. Retention periods of the memory are <br>
themselves very brief. Memory cannot afford to pause over given stages of motion if it is to <br>
track further motion. Still, the effects of conditioning remain in perception and anticipa-<br>
tion for longer.1009<br>
<br>
In each case of these anticipatory eye movements, there is anticipatory <i>representation</i>, <br>
not merely perceptual anticipation<i>.</i> The movements are guided by antecedent perceptions. <br>
The movements track and yield constancies about bodies, their positions, and other at tri-<br>
butes through the tracking. The constancies concern the future.<br><br>
