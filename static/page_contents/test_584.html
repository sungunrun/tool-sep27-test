en dogen ous ly controlled attention. Further, memory is required for stabilizing perceptual <br>
representations across the inter-saccadic interval.<br>
<br>
Perception and memory are certainly distinct types of representation. But the operation <br>
of TSM is so dependent for its content on perception, so integral to the workings of the <br>
visual system, so involved with primitive operations of the system, and so phylogenetically <br>
contemporary with those primitive operations, that counting TSM “cognitive” or “concep-<br>
tual”, on the grounds that it is memory not perception, would be hard to take seriously.<br>
<br>
Hence, some types of memory operate at the same non-cognitive representational level <br>
as perception. Visual sensory memory and FVSTMemory are such types. TSM is another. <br>
I think that aspects of visual working memory and aspects of visual long-term memory <br>
are further examples. Such types of memory are systems that serve perception and enable <br>
it to carry out some of its most basic functions. They are natural aspects of a perceptual <br>
system, required by the most basic physical characteristics of the system. These types of <br>
memory are not more sophisticated, more abstract, more nearly intellectual, or more <br>
knowledge-like than perception. They are components of the visual system.<br><br>

<b>Visual Working Memory<br><br>
</div>
</b>A highly restricted sub-part of a perceptual representation passes through visual sensory <br>
memory and FVSTM into visual working memory (VWM). <i>Visual working memory</i> is <br>
standardly characterized as a system that provides short-term retention of visual informa-<br>
tion, including visual perceptual representation, in a way that yields rapid access to con-<br>
sciousness and easy manipulation in support of representational and actional tasks.862 <br>
<i>Perceptual VWM</i> is VWM that functions to encode and retain visual perceptual <br>
representations.<br>
<br>
Notice the characterization’s treatment of VWM as a system for retention that <i>allows</i> <br>
easy manipulation. VWM’s allowing manipulation of its visual information is compatible <br>
with its being in itself just a system for retention. Perceptual VWM retains perceptual rep-<br>
resentation. Conceptual VWM retains conceptual representation. There are non-symbolic <br>
and symbolic VWM systems. Each system retains both perceptual representations and <br>
conceptual representations. I lay the symbolic typic of VWM aside for the present. There <br>
are working memory systems for hearing and touch. I focus on visual working memory <br>
not specialized for linguistic or other symbolic items.<br>
<br>
Visual working memory is not <i>in itself</i> a supra-perceptual system, although a species of <br>
VWM retains conceptual content. VWM is a genus. Memory-system species are percep-<br>
tual, cognitive, or conceptual, by virtue of the type of level of representation that they <br><br>
