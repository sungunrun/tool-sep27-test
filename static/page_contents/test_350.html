350 The Iconic Nature of Perception</div>
<br><br>
Part–whole constraints are most salient for the spatial aspects of iconic representations. <br>
Analogs occur for temporal aspects. When perception represents motion, stages of the <br>
perceptual state, extended in time, that occur earlier tend to map to earlier parts of the <br>
motion, and correspondingly for later stages.<br>
<br>
Not all iconic structural aspects of perceptual content fit part–whole principles. Iconic <br>
mappings for color work off of degrees of intensity, saturation, hue. For example, qualitative <br>
intensity of a visual representation of a color—generated by intensity of neural firings—is <br>
systematically correlated with intensities in a spectrum, scaled to allow for illumination. <br>
A systematic natural mapping might be from more intense color or lightness representations <br>
to more intense color or lightness <i>representata</i>. (See note 332.)<br>
<br>
Constraints that derive from iconic scalar mappings—spectral, spatial, or temporal—<br>
are not the full story of structure in perceptual iconic formats. Some aspects of packaging <br>
are structural. Normal visual perception of nearby items represents shape and size as a <br>
package. Special viewing conditions can break down such structural constraints. Packages <br>
can be loosened, or come unstuck, especially in perceptual memory. Still, I think it worth-<br>
while to think of packaging as a structural feature of iconic perceptual representation.<br>
<br>
There is nothing more to representational structure or content than the way the seman-<br>
tical primitives are put together. Perceptual structure and content are exhaustively deter-<br>
mined by these factors. That representational contents have <i>canonical</i> decompositions is <br>
also straightforward. The representational structure of perception is compositional, and <br>
has a canonical decomposition. Compositionality of representational structure involves <br>
the attributional structures just mentioned, together with some scope hierarchies, and in <br>
most cases the iconic format structures that I have been discussing. Part–whole iconic <br>
compositionality is relative to perceptual segmentation of natural units, and depends on <br>
what a part is. Its compositionality and decompositionality are otherwise straightforward. <br>
Other types of scalar iconic representations are similar. Specifying these structures is non-<br>
trivial. Their having a non-arbitrary compositional structure seems clear.<br>
<br>
For perceptual psychology, processing is inevitably the central topic. However, process-<br>
ing cannot be fully understood in abstraction from structure. Both have their place in sci-<br>
ence. Perceptual structure differs importantly from linguistic structure in that it is not <br>
infinitely or indefinitely productive. There is no recursive structure in perception that <br>
could mark a competence to generate infinitely many representational contents. There is <br>
less variety in the basic structural types of representational primitives. The structural con-<br>
straints on perceptual contents are not as complex, varied, and rich as those in language. <br>
They are, however, rich and distinctive enough, I hope, to deserve further constructive <br>
development.<br><br>

</b>In what follows, I describe a natural, iconic, 1–1-into spatial mapping common in visual <br>
perception. This mapping offers insight, I think, into a central iconic aspect of relations <br>
between visual perception and surfaces in 3-D space. The mapping is from positions of the <br>
matrix of representation to every position of every perceived surface and surface-part at a <br>
given time. Adjacent parts of the mapping need not form representational units. The </div>
