236 Attributives, Referential Applications in Constancies</div>

conditions that led to the formation of the belief in different people or on different occa-<br>
sions. Although we have at least two non-complex concepts that apply exactly to mer-<br>
cury—expressed respectively by ‘mercury’ and ‘quicksilver’—, the range of non-complex <br>
linguistic attributives that apply to a given attribute is vastly smaller than the range of <br>
basic attributives for a given attribute in perception.<br>
<br>
Perceptual representation for a given spatial attribute varies systematically with differ-<br>
ent stimulus antecedents. The depth, direction, and orientation of an instance of a spatial <br>
attribute, and of objects that have spatial attributes like size, can vary. Since attributives for <br>
spatial attributes are plottings by depth and direction, the number of attributives comput-<br>
able and computed in a perceptual constancy, <i>for any given attribute</i>, is very large. Iconic <br>
format grounds the fine-grained character of perceptual attributives.<br>
<br>
One can conceive an edge without conceiving it as having a specific size, shape, or <br>
orien ta tion. At close ranges, one normally cannot perceive an edge as an edge without <br>
perceiving it as having specific determinations of those attributes. Such connections <br>
among attributives derive from the iconicity of perceptual representation. I call these <br>
complexes “<i>representational packages</i>”.<br>
<br>
Perceptual systems are geared to represent from whatever vantage point the perceiver <br>
happens to be in. Since every attribute that is perceptually discernible can be represented <br>
(differently, but still as that attribute) from any vantage point from which it can be percep-<br>
tually discerned, and since perceivers tend to be in different vantage points, many percep-<br>
tual attributives for a given environmental attribute are used only once, by a given <br>
individual’s perceptual system. Often, one perceives a specific contour, or ensemble of <br>
surfaces, only once. Also commonly, one perceives a specific contour, or ensemble of sur-<br>
faces, from the same perspective only once.<br>
<br>
In any <i>one</i> visual perception, the number of perceptual attributives and the number of <br>
perceptual referential applications of them are huge. Perceptual attributives are capacities <br>
to make sensory discriminations under specific stimulus conditions. One perceives edges, <br>
their lengths, shapes, orientations, and their parts; surfaces, their colors, textures, surface <br>
shapes, sizes, orientations, motions, and parts; bodies, their colors, textures, 3-D volume <br>
shapes, sizes, orientations, textures, and parts; motions and other changes by bodies and <br>
surfaces; and the directions and locations or ordinal depth relations among these various <br>
entities in egocentrically anchored physical space. Perceptual attributives for each of these <br>
perceptually discernible attributes are applied in any given scene. Different stimulus con-<br>
ditions cause different responses and applications of different attributives to each attribute. <br>
A system processes new attributives in new combinations—many for the first time—as <br>
circumstances change.<br>
<br>
What prevents the representational resources of a perceptual system from being limit-<br>
less? One factor is a limit on the grain of perceptual discernibility or perceptual differen-<br>
tiation. Another is a limit on the number of generic ranges of attributes that a perceptual <br>
system handles (edges, surface, various spatial properties and relations, colors, textures, <br>
bodies, motions, perhaps some functional attributes—for mammalian visual systems). <br>
Another is the set of laws governing percept-attribute-formation. The laws process and <br>
filter just-discernible sensory information in a limited range of ways. Even so, there <br>
remains a huge number of perspectival ways of representing each of a huge number of <br>
perceptually discernible attributes.</div>
