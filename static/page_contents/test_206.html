206  Form and Semantics of Perceptual Contents</div>
<br><br>
<i>non</i>-noun-phrase-like structures. A noun-phrase-like structure is the whole functioning <br>
structure.<br>
<br>
Forming combinations of linguistic expressions is an activity under the control of the <br>
language user. Parts of noun phrases can be intentionally recombined. Combinations of <br>
noun phrases with further structures is also an activity under the intentional control of <br>
language users.<br>
<br>
Structural sub-parts of perceptual contents cannot be recombined, in perception, by <br>
decisions of the perceiver. They are automatic products of processes that begin with the <br>
receipt of sensory information. Perceivers can redirect attention. They cannot, at will, recom-<br>
bine structural parts of perceptual contents, in perception. As I discuss later (Chapter 9, <br>
the section Compositionality in Iconic Perceptual Representation), <br>
 however, perceptual representational structures are recombine-able, through automatic <br>
operations in a perceptual system, because they are semantically compositional.<br>
<br>
Noun phrases are easy to instantiate in various media. They are built up from a few <br>
primitives (letters or morphemes or phonemes). They can be written in different media <br>
without loss—printed in italics, traced in sand, stamped in Braille, beeped in Morse <br>
code—or spoken.<br>
<br>
Perceptual representation is more closely associated with a particular mode of presenta-<br>
tion. Perceptual representation is intuitively more analog-like.200 Of course, perceptual <br>
representation can be approximated by small digital representation units. There is a min-<br>
imum grain of perceptual discriminability that prevents any perceptual representation <br>
from being strictly continuous and from having an infinite range of differences along any <br>
scale or dimension. Still, variations in spatial, temporal, and color-lightness values are <br>
limit ed only by capacities for perceptual differentiation in the perceptual system. Within <br>
those limits, every perceptual differentiation in a perceptual representation—<i>modulo</i> <br>
interferences—makes a difference to perceptual content.<br>
<br>
Linguistic noun phrases can be produced to express an unlimited range of meanings. <br>
One can make a noun phrase for any subject matter. There is a limited number of percep-<br>
tual dimensions, at least at the basic levels of perception—lightness/color, geometrical/<br>
topological properties and relations, temporal relations, movement, and a few others. Even <br>
functional perceptual attributives (such as food) and species-specific attributives (such as <br>
face) are probably limited in range or type. They are limited by the limitations of percep-<br>
tual competencies.<br>
<br>
Let us return to the difference between noun phrases and perceptual representation that <br>
resides in the linear order of a noun phrase. It is convenient to illustrate perceptual repre-<br>
sentational content as a line of symbols. I have done so. Most perceptual content is not <br>
linear. Perhaps some auditory perception has linear form. Perceptual systems of vision, <br>
touch, and proprioception are almost never linear in their form of representation. The <br>
format of their representational contents is more analogous to the layout of a drawing or <br>
realist painting or map that represents a scene as being in 3-D depth. Even hearing can <br>
yield a spatial sound map.<br><br>
