perception-formation, 200–500 ms after stimulus onset.960 This connection between <br>
VLTM of scene gist and current perceptual categorization is between perceptual attribu-<br>
tives in memory and perceptual attributives currently formed in perceptual processing. A <br>
sense of congruence or incongruence is simply a familiar association or an unfamiliar <br>
association. Insofar as there are conceptual scene-gist representations in VLTM that figure <br>
in the causal story, they do so via perceptual attributives and associations among them. For <br>
example, the conceptual incongruity pig and kitchen has a counterpart perceptual-level <br>
incongruity pig-body and kitchen-ensemble of shaped bodies and surfaces. Computational <br>
explanation stays at the perceptual level. Although conceptual causation of perceptual <br>
counterparts may sometimes occur, such occurrence is not indispensable to explaining <br>
processing of perceptual categorizations. Computational explanations leave them out. <br>
There is no <i>essential</i> or <i>indispensable</i> appeal to propositional capacities in current <br>
explanations.<br>
<br>
Because VLTM of scene-gist perceptual representation commonly lacks recall of spe-<br>
cific particulars, the role of gist representation in VLTM is usually a special case of the <br>
function of ability-general perceptual memory to aid perception-formation. I dwell a bit <br>
on this function. There is a distinction between (a) past perceptions’ re-setting perceptual <br>
processing to mold to common environmental types and (b) past perceptions’ aiding pro-<br>
cessing by supplying remembered types for newly formed perceptions to be compared <br>
with—to refine current perception. Distinguishing these cases is empirically delicate. <br>
Stable-looking psychological models that distinguish input from memory into perception <br>
from structures that are part of perceptual processing, but that derive from perceptual <br>
learning via memory, have not been established.<br>
<br>
Along with much of the science, I assume the distinction. (See Chapter 16, the section <br>
Priming and Memory.) Fastest perception-formation does not rely on memory. <br>
Slower formation—mostly 150–160 ms after stimulus onset—does. So comparative <br>
matching between an attributive in long-term perceptual memory and a currently formed <br>
perceptual attributive occurs in later stages of perceptual processing. Much of the com-<br>
parative matching is pre-categorizational. Much centers on shape images. Representation <br>
of a specific shape is faster if it has been seen before. Ability-general perceptual LTM <br>
speeds formation of the currently perceived shape. Remembered shape ensembles in a gist <br>
memory are compared with a just-formed representation of an object’s shape and the per-<br>
cep tual ly attributed gist shape ensemble that the object is perceived as embedded in.<br>
<br>
Attributives in memory can be formed through perceptual learning. Subjects report no <br>
awareness that a given shape-type has been repeated in experiments. Comparison-<br>
matching between a remembered perceptual attributive and a newly formed perceptual <br>
attributive speeds perceptual formation and aids visual search.961<br>
<br>
Some pre-categorizational matching between retained information and a newly formed <br>
state seems to occur at early stages of visual processing.962 Subjects were shown to associ-<br>
ate, unconsciously, a target-object (say, a T-shape) at a certain orientation (say, on its side <br><br>
