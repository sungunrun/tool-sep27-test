The referential applications function to pick out particulars. Attributional applications in <br>
perception occur when and only when the attributives are applied referentially. In fact, a <br>
referential application in perception is always also an attributional application. In percep-<br>
tion, general attributional competencies are applied referentially.<br>
<br>
An occurrent referential application in perception is an event—or, if you prefer, an <br>
instantiated aspect of a perceptual-state-instance. However, a referential application can <br>
be preserved in memory. This preservation is similar to anaphora in language. An initial <br>
occurrent use of a demonstrative pronoun can be “re-instantiated” by another occurrence <br>
of the pronoun that links to the first occurrence by anaphora. So although referential <br>
applications are individuated in terms of occurrent events, or occurrent aspects of states, <br>
and although many referential applications just <i>are</i> events localized in time, there is a use <br>
for ‘referential application’ that applies to a special kind of type. It is a type individuated by <br>
an initial occurrent event. A referential application in perceptual memory is a different <br>
event from the referential application in a perception that the memory functions to retain. <br>
But the two events can instantiate a single referential application. The referential function <br>
and power of the second instantiation depends entirely on those of the first. I return to <br>
this point in a few paragraphs.<br>
<br>
Perceptual referential applications refer not only to individual “objects” (such as bodies <br>
and surfaces). They refer to instances of properties, or tropes, such as instances of colors <br>
and shapes, and to events, like motions. I discuss this matter in Chapter 6, the section <br>
Perception of Property Instances. Most perceptual referential applications are <br>
not acts. They are not under individual control. Referential applications guided by <br>
en dogen ous attention <i>can</i> be acts. As a rule of thumb, however, it is better to think of per-<br>
ceptual referential applications as events in an individual’s perceptual system, rather than <br>
as acts by the individual.<br>
<br>
Perception’s functioning to pick out particulars figures in the representational contents, <br>
hence in veridicality conditions of perception. Whether a perceptual-state-instance is <br>
accurate or not depends partly on whether the occurrent singular element has a referent <br>
or not. So referential applications figure in the veridicality conditions of all perceptual-<br>
state-instances. Perceptual-state-types are neither accurate nor inaccurate. Only a <br>
perceptual-state-instance that is occurrently caused and that contains one or more refer-<br>
ential applications is accurate or inaccurate.<br>
<br>
Since referential applications in perceptual states come into being and function to refer <br>
only by being occurrently caused, they are context-dependent, or context-bound. They <br>
depend on context for having whatever referents they have. They are not general, re peat-<br>
able, representational contents, like attributives, that have their <i>representatum</i> in a context-<br>
independent way. In their dependence on context, referential applications are like <br>
occurrent <i>uses</i> of the word ‘that’.<br>
<br>
As I have stressed, referential applications can fail to refer. In perception, their failing to <br>
refer constitutes <i>referential illusion</i>. These are cases in which a perceptual state is formed, <br>
but there is a misperception via the state that involves an illusion of there being some par-<br>
ticular: no particular is perceived. For example, a perceptual state might present a surface. <br>
The perceptual system may attribute surfacehood. The cause of the surface-perception is <br>
an accidental confluence of light. No coherent entity—such as a puff of smoke—is percep-<br>
tually picked out, but misperceived as a surface. Absent a coherent unified entity that <br>
causes the relevant aspect of the perceptual state, nothing is perceived at all. The </div>
