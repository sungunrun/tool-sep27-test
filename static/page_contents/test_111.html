Nothing in them is about, makes reference to, or otherwise represents perceptual states or <br>
perceptual contents.<br>
<br>
Whereas the principles specify transition patterns in mathematical terms, perceptual <br>
systems do not specify anything in terms of mathematical structures. Rather, the systems <br>
contain perceptual states that operate in mathematically structured patterns discovered by <br>
psychologists. Different but equivalent mathematics can be equally good in formulating <br>
transformation principles. Perceptual states always have a single representational content, <br>
constituting a single mode of presentation as of a subject matter.<br>
<br>
The principles governing transformations in perceptual systems are thus not analogous <br>
to rules that are specified, or specifiable, in the proof systems of logicians. They are not <br>
even unconscious analogs of such rules. Psychological theories of perception can be <br>
 modeled on computers. Transitions that occur in perceptual systems are computational. <br>
The information registrations that are inputs into the system together with the laws of <br>
trans form ation determine perceptual outputs—<i>modulo</i> interferences. None of these <br>
points supports the view that the principles of transformation are the representational <br>
contents of any psychological state or process in the perceiver’s perceptual system.<br><br>

<b>Perception, Computation, and the Language-of-Thought Hypothesis<br><br>
</div>
</b>Models in mainstream perceptual psychology are computational. I take this fact seriously.<br>
<br>
Some philosophers and a few psychologists influenced by philosophers take psy cho-<br>
logic al systems to be computational in a specific way. They maintain a language-of-thought <br>
hypothesis, according to which computations operate on language-like symbols. The sym-<br>
bols are taken to be the symbols that they are independently of their meaning or represen-<br>
tational content. This view was first proposed by Jerry Fodor. It gained some traction <br>
among some cognitive psychologists, although it is certainly not a common view in main-<br>
stream perceptual psychology.116 Some philosophers regard this view as the only viable <br>
way to understand computations in a psychological system. Such philosophers rarely show <br>
specific knowledge of perceptual psychology.<br>
<br>
I am agnostic, leaning toward doubtful, about the hypothesis as applied to areas of <br>
psych ology <i>other</i> than perceptual psychology. I believe that there is no evidence for the <br>
hypothesis in the current practice of perceptual psychology. I believe that the hypothesis is <br>
not true of computations in perceptual systems. In this section, I explain these views.117<br>
<br>
In understanding the language-of-thought hypothesis, it is crucial to distinguish what <br>
is and what is not at issue. Whether perceptual psychology takes some computations in <br>
perceptual systems to operate on structured representational states or structured repre-<br>
sentations is not at issue. What is at issue is whether such computations operate on <br>
language-like symbols <i>whose identities do not depend in any way on their representational <br>
contents, or on what they represent</i>.<br><br>
