hypotheses that such representation is supra-perceptual.587 For example, the fact that <br>
causal impressions are generated in fast and automatic ways from subtle, specific types of <br>
movement that are not accessible to consciousness has been cited as a “hallmark” of per-<br>
ception.588 Fast, automatic processing and subtle cues are compatible with representation <br>
that depends on perception, but is supra-perceptual. Many non-inferential empirical <br>
beliefs share the properties cited as “hallmarks” of perception. Similarly, the fact that <br>
causal impressions are not extinguished in certain situations, even when one believes that <br>
relevant interactions are not causal, has been cited as ground for taking primitive causal <br>
representation to be perceptual. However, core-cognition, associative-learning, and first-<br>
inclination-to-believe accounts can accommodate the evidence. If primitive representa-<br>
tion of causation were through beliefs, the impression or inclination associated with the <br>
beliefs could remain even if one came to reject the beliefs.<br>
<br>
In fact, Michotte’s methods, on their own, seem unable to settle the issue. Adults’ <i>saying</i> <br>
that they perceive causation is no more dispositive than adults’ saying that they perceive <br>
that there is cancer by looking at an x-ray, for showing that relevant attributives (cause and <br>
cancer) are produced by the visual perceptual system. Infants’ tracking mechanical caus-<br>
ation does not in itself show what processes are involved in doing so.<br>
<br>
On the other hand, some common arguments in the scientific literature <i>against</i> taking <br>
causal representation to be perceptual are unconvincing. One such argument is that causal <br>
representation is “too abstract” or “too high-order”—or requires more “understanding” <br>
than children have—to be perceptual representation.589 I have already answered this claim.<br>
<br>
Another type of argument against taking representation of causation to be perceptual <br>
merits fuller discussion. From its beginning, infants’ representation of mechanical caus-<br>
ation is closely related to other types of representation. The idea is that such inter-relations <br>
show that representation of mechanical causation depends on “inferences” that are incom-<br>
patible with its being perceptual.<br>
<br>
I consider two arguments of this type. Here is one. Susan Carey reasons,<br><br>
If infants’ earliest causal representations are determined exclusively by the operation of <br>
<br>
the perceptual module, Michotte would therefore predict that, at some ages, infants per-<br>
<br>
ceive causality in simple interactions like launching events, but they cannot make infer-<br>
<br>
ences about unseen causal interactions.590<br><br>
She cites an unpublished experiment by William Ball (1973), often replicated. Children <br>
are habituated to an event that begins with one block’s standing stationary, partially <br>
occluded by the right side of a screen. Then another block of the same size moves on stage <br>
from left to right. It passes behind the screen so that it is no longer visible. Soon afterwards, <br><br>
