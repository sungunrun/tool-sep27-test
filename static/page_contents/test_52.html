non-psychological laws of physics, chemistry, and biology—determines neither the en vir-<br>
on mental entities that are represented nor the perceptual states that represent them?<br>
<br>
Here is a simplified specification of the under-determination problem for vision. The <br>
first effect of the environment on visual system is a state that registers the radiance at each <br>
location in the plane of retinal sensors for each wavelength of light. This registration in ev-<br>
it ably involves some loss of information, primarily through defocus. This registration is <br>
commonly understood, and represented mathematically, as a two-dimensional array. This <br>
first registration, or encoding, of proximal stimulation goes through a series of processing <br>
stages that eventuate in perceptual representations of, and as of, entities in three-<br>
dimensional space. There are determinate geometrical and optical solutions to the ques-<br>
tion of how a three-dimensional array projects onto a two-dimensional coding of that <br>
array. There are no such solutions to how a two-dimensional coding of an array projects <br>
back to the three-dimensional, distal environmental source of that coding. And apart <br>
from specifically psychological laws, there are no solutions to how such a two-dimensional <br>
coding is transformed into a representation of, and as of, a three-dimensional scene. The <br>
retinal codings, together with all other registration of proximal input, under-determines <br>
even the <i>physically possible</i> distal environmental antecedents. Hence they under-determine <br>
perceptual states that represent there being only one of these possible distal antecedents.<br>
<br>
Perceptual psychology discovers laws that govern the formation of these environment-<br>
specifying perceptual states from the under-determining registration of proximal stimula-<br>
tion. The formation laws, or law-like patterns, of processing <i>privilege</i> certain possible <br>
distal environmental causal antecedents over others. The effect of the privileging is that a <br>
perceptual state represents exactly one of the many possible environmental causes that is <br>
optically compatible with the given registration of proximal stimulation. Because such <br>
perceptual states are under-determined not only by the proximal stimulation, but also by <br>
the antecedent, distal environmental causes, the perceptual states are subject to error. <br>
Errors occur when non-privileged, usually abnormal, environmental circumstances prod-<br>
uce the same kind of registration of proximal stimulation that the privileged circumstances <br>
produce. Giving an account of perceptual error is also a topic for the science.45<br>
<br>
<i>Objectification</i> occurs through the ways in which perceptual systems overcome the <br>
under-determination problem. Such systems distinguish patterns in the initial sensory <br>
registration of proximal stimulation that are likely to be adventitious to the occasion, or <br>
idiosyncratic to the subject, from patterns that derive from and cue specific aspects of the <br>
environment. Relevant environmental aspects are normally counted distal stimuli. They <br>
can remain constant even if proximal stimuli that signal them vary. For visual perception, <br>
the constant environmental aspects are distal. Proprioception filters distal causes inside <br>
the perceiver’s body from proximal ones.<br>
<br>
Given that the correlations with specific aspects of the environment function to be <br>
accurate, the processes that distinguish them from proximal stimulation constitute ob ject-<br>
ifi ca tion. Objectification lies in distinguishing idiosyncratic, proximal, or subjective <br>
aspects of the individual from aspects that cue an objective subject matter that is constant <br><br>
