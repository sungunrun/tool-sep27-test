distinguish entities capable of agency on the basis of specific shapes, independently of <br>
movement. (See Chapter 10, the section Two Lines of Empirical Criticism of <br>
Treisman’s Theory.) Call these ‘animal-shapes’. Shapes of snakes and spiders that are <br>
functionally important to survival are coded innately into many visual systems. Such <br>
shapes are associated with functional responses. For example, spider shapes trigger avoid-<br>
ance reactions.607 Dispositions to such responses seem innate. Responsiveness to danger <br>
based on shape is present in humans, monkeys, tadpoles, and other non-human animals.<br>
<br>
Shapes associated with succor are also coded early in visual systems. Faces are repre-<br>
sented as potential sources of agency. Analogs of human face perception occur in non-<br>
mammals—most famously chicks, which respond to shapes and motions characteristic of <br>
animal agents. Specialized templates may help the visual system group shapes that ground <br>
attribution of functionally important corollaries—for example, benevolent agents.608<br>
<br>
Although some primitive representation of agency centers on shape cues, motion cues <br>
are also effective. Two traditions study primitive representation of agency from motion.<br>
<br>
One is the point-light tradition begun by Gunnar Johannson.609 To exclude influences <br>
of knowledge on perception as far as possible, Johannsson adopted the <i>point-light tech-<br>
nique</i> initiated by French physiologist Etienne-Jules Marey (1894). Johannson showed <br>
that by seeing the movements of widely spaced points of light attached to an un illu min-<br>
ated human body against a black background (or by seeing the movements of such lights <br>
ori gin al ly placed on a human body but later shown on a black screen), humans can easily <br>
classify movements as walking, talking, playing, eating, and can differentiate gender. This <br>
tradition is distinctive in its use of movements among a coordinated set of body-parts.<br>
<br>
A second tradition focuses on movements of wholes. The key cue is endogenously <br>
caused motion—self-propulsion. This cue includes manifestations of “non-Newtonian”, <br>
biological motion, marked by endogenously caused movement with a non-rigid, animal-<br>
like character.610 Biological motion includes sudden slowing down or speeding up, chan-<br>
ging direction without being contacted, synchronous motion with other bodies at a <br>
distance, certain types of approach and avoidance. Even many entities facing one another <br><br>

often associated with the term ‘biological motion’. I use the term more broadly, to cover both motion studied in <br>
this tradition—which involves integration of movements of various body-parts—and motion that is both endo-<br>
geneously caused and broadly animal-like, even if representing such motion does not require integrating differ-<br>
ent movements of body-parts.<br>
<br>
610 In human infants, endogeneously caused motion in itself does not trigger relevant responses. The motion <br>
must be non-rigid and rhythmic—in some cases, motion of a limited range of agents.</div>
