analogizing is a mark of human cognition, and that no analogizing occurs at the percep-<br>
tual level.1185<br>
<br>
The progression in development and learning is certainly a significant driver in the <br>
development of cognitive capacities.1186 Individuals become more consciously sensitive to <br>
more generic structural relations as they develop and become more educated. Analogizing <br>
is an important domain for reflecting on cognition and its differences from perceptual-<br>
level capacities.<br>
<br>
Our issue is where the progression begins. Do analogical operations already occur in <br>
perceptual systems? Or are such operations always cognitive?<br>
<br>
Functional relations like <i>mate-of</i> and <i>gives-to</i> may well be perceptually attributed. Mere <br>
attribution of such relations is not analogizing. Even if such relations are perceptually <br>
attributed, analogizing may not occur at perceptual levels. For an analogical operation in a <br>
perceptual-level system would be a <i>transition</i> from representing relatively concrete rela-<br>
tions among perceived entities—say, spatial relations—to representing different types of <br>
relations, such as agential or functional relations, that the particulars also enter into. <br>
Analogical operations use attributions of more concrete relations to trigger formation of <br>
more generic relations. The fact that both spatial relations and agential, or other functional <br>
relations, are represented in a perceptual system would not entail that there are analogiz-<br>
ing transitions from the former to the latter in the system.<br>
<br>
Similar issues arise among unquestionably perceptual relational attributives. Relations <br>
like <i>larger than</i> and <i>farther from</i>, and symmetry relations are certainly attributed per cep-<br>
tual ly. Is a move from attributing these relations to focused-upon particulars to attending <br>
to a common relation among different particulars analogizing?<br>
<br>
The classical signature of analogical operations is comparison leading to relational <br>
alignment. <i>Comparison</i> is a domain-general process that often leads to detection of com-<br>
monalities or differences in a pair of situations or domains. <i>Alignment</i> involves one–one <br>
mapping among <i>relata</i> such that if a pair of relational attributives are placed in cor res-<br>
pond ence, then the representations that are related are placed in correspondence.1187 One <br>
needs to determine whether this signature shows up in operations in perceptual systems.<br>
<br>
Can comparison and alignment be applied, perhaps only unconsciously, at the percep-<br>
tual level to yield analogies? For example, can individuals, relying on perception and per-<br>
ceptual learning alone, use pair-wise size comparisons of size to trigger focus on a generic <br>
relation like <i>smaller than</i>? Can seeing different individuals in different spatial relations <br>
that are in fact giving something to other individuals trigger comparison and alignment <br>
among the individuals so as to attribute <i>a giving</i>, <i>w</i>, <i>of x</i>, <i>by y</i>, <i>to z</i>? If perceptual attribu-<br>
tives for action are acquired by perceptual learning, it is plausible that they can be acquired <br>
by comparison and alignment.<br><br>
