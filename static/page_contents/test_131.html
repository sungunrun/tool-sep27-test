<b>Basic Form Of Perceptual Contents<br><br>
</div>
</b>The basic form of perceptual representational contents, broached in Chapter 2, is<br><br>
(that x1)F(x1).<br><br>
All perception contains in its representational content at least one occurrence of a scope-<br>
dominant context-dependent referential determiner-type, analogous to the demonstrative <br>
‘that’ (or ‘those’), conceived as a word-<i>type</i>. Normally, there are multitudes of referential <br>
applications of determiners in a perceptual state. The determiner-type is a repeatable com-<br>
petence for singular reference.<br>
<br>
The determiner is associated with at least one perceptual attributive, analogous to F . F is a <br>
representational content. The content is a repeatable attributional competence. Normally, there <br>
are multitudes of such attributives. Always, some attributive guides referential application of a <br>
determiner. Indeed, every occurrence of a determiner applies at least one guiding attributive.137<br>
<br>
A referential application, marked by the subscript ‘1’, is an occurrent application of the <br>
determiner. It is both an exercise of the referential competence, typed by that, and an <br>
application of one or more attributives. The exercise/application is an occurrent event, or <br>
occurrent aspect of a state. The referential application both functions to refer to a per-<br>
ceived particular and initiates application of the attributives(s)—initiates attributional <br>
applications. Attributional applications function to characterize perceived entities picked <br>
out by the referential applications.<br>
<br>
The form is analogous to a certain type of noun phrase. Perceived entities picked out by <br>
referential applications can not only instantiate attributed properties and kinds; they can <br>
also stand in attributed relations. So forms like<br><br>

<b>Cont FN</b>137 A perceptual attributive <i>guides</i> a perceptual referential application if the attributive functions to be ac cur-<br>
ate of what the referential application picks out, and the attributive functions as an important restriction, in a <br>
context, on the referential application’s purported referent. See Burge, ‘Five Theses of <i>De Re</i> States and <br>
Attitudes’, 257.</div>
