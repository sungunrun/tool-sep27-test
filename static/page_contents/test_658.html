Shallowness occurs beyond perceptual representations. Perceptual <i>concepts</i>  are simi-<br>
larly shallow. Recall that a <i>perceptual concept</i> is a concept that maintains the mode of pres-<br>
entation of a perceptual attributive and indicates the attribute that that perceptual <br>
attributive indicates, but functions constitutively to contribute to propositional structures. <br>
So the sixth mark is shared with non-perceptual systems, indeed systems of propositional <br>
attitudes. The shallowness of perceptual concepts is, however, clearly derivative from the <br>
shallowness of perceptual attributives.<br>
<br>
Much the same can be said about the first mark—domain specificity. Some specializa-<br>
tion for properties by perceptual systems is obvious. It is an open empirical question what <br>
range of input any given perceptual system is sensitive to. Visual systems do not limit <br>
themselves to stimulations of the retina by light. They take in proprioceptive information <br>
from the motor system, for example, about the directions in which the eyes are pointed. <br>
Citing such points does not constitute an objection to Fodor’s mark, contrary to some <br>
critics.1067<br>
<br>
The key mark of modularity, for Fodor, is the fifth one: encapsulation. I stress two <br>
points. First, Fodor’s paradigm of potential incursion into a modular input system is a <br>
propositional attitude. This paradigm has not always been retained in subsequent discus-<br>
sion. Second, an important type of potential penetration is not just any non-pathological <br>
causal influence, but influence embodied in computational input necessary for perceptual <br>
processing. New Look psychology was not computational. It did take perceptual process-<br>
ing to operate on concepts that figure in background theory. As noted, Fodor mentions, <br>
but does not develop, this second point.<br>
<br>
Of course, views about encapsulation presuppose a view of what counts as the system’s <br>
boundaries. One cannot determine whether the visual system is penetrated from outside, <br>
unless one knows what counts as inside and what counts as outside. Fodor makes the <br>
point well: ‘The problem of assessing the degree of information encapsulation of input <br>
systems is thus not independent of the problem of determining how such systems are indi-<br>
viduated and what sorts of representations constitute their outputs’. He recognized, and <br>
stressed, that recurrent processing effects that come from within a given input system do <br>
not count against encapsulation.1068<br>
<br>
When Fodor wrote, the best perceptual science emphasized feed-forward, bottom-up <br>
processing as overwhelmingly dominant. Later, as outlined in Chapter 11, the section Two <br>
Changes in Scientific Understanding of Perception-Formation, con-<br>
siderable recurrent feedback was discovered, at nearly all processing stages. Assuming a <br>
simple processing hierarchy is not tenable. The issues that Fodor raised remain complex. <br>
Key notions in judging encapsulation—psychological system, cognition, penetration—are <br>
unclarified. What to count as an encapsulated <i>system</i> is conceptually and empirically diffi-<br>
cult. There is no well-grounded consensus on what counts as cognition. Different notions <br>
of penetration are used by different authors.<br>
<br>
When Fodor wrote <i>The Modularity of Mind</i>, and even to the time of his death in 2017, <br>
he harbored serious misconceptions of perception. He thought that all attribution is <br><br>
