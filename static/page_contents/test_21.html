I take sense perception necessarily to have a modality. This point is partly ter mino-<br>
logic al, though it derives from reflection on important differences in kind between modal <br>
and amodal psychological states. In any case, I take sensory states, whether perceptual or <br>
non-perceptual to have a modality, a capacity dedicated to responding to characteristic <br>
stimuli, characteristically through a significant anatomical pathway, like touch, hearing, or <br>
vision. The modality is controlled by the stimulus that the sensory system, of which the <br>
sensory state is a part, is specialized to register. Often, the stimuli for a given modality are <br>
multi-modal. Vision takes input from proprioception, for example. The final representa-<br>
tional product and the function of the use of the stimuli is, however, specifically visual. <br>
Moreover, at least in the case of vision, visual representations <i>can</i> lean entirely on retinal <br>
stimuli but cannot lean entirely on proprioceptive stimuli. Each system generates states <br>
that usually derive dominantly from specialized sensory registration. Where a perceptual <br>
modality is conscious; the distinctiveness of the modality is palpable.18<br>
<br>
To say that perceptions necessarily have a modality is not to say that a given sense-<br>
perceptual state cannot be influenced by other contemporary sensory states, including <br>
perceptions, of different modalities. Most sensory states, including most perceptions, are <br>
subject to inter-modal influence. Indeed, memories from states of other modalities can <br>
cross-modally influence the formation of a perceptual state.<br>
<br>
The point is rather that sensory perceptual states themselves have specific modalities. <br>
Sensory perceptual systems are systems for discrimination that are specialized to deal with <br>
a certain sort of physical parameter that is the primary stimulus.<br>
<br>
Some authors write of amodal (as distinguished from inter-modally influenced) percep-<br>
tion. One can use ‘perception’ in various ways. I think that such states are different enough <br>
from sense-perceptual states, that it is better to use a different term for amodal states.<br><br>

<b>Representation and Information Registration<br><br>
</div>
</b>Perception is <i>representational</i>. It represents environmental entities. Doing so is an aspect of <br>
its fundamental nature.<br>
<br>
Understanding what it means for perception to be representational requires distin-<br>
guishing two uses of ‘representational’ that are prevalent in philosophy and science. One <br>
use applies very widely, too widely to be a mark of mind. It applies to any state that <br>
responds to a specific range of stimuli in a way that tends to fulfill a function of an organ-<br>
ism. The narrower use is the one I want.<br><br>

<b>FOOTNOTES</b><br>
<b>Cont FN</b>18 There is much more to be said than this cursory exposition of sensory modality suggests. What I say here is <br>
at best approximate, not anywhere near adequate. As far as I know, nothing central in the book depends on doing <br>
better. I rely only on a rough, intuitive notion of sensory modality. For a better overview, see M. Matthen, <br>
‘Individuating the Senses’, in M. Matthen ed., <i>Oxford Handbook of the Philosophy of Perception</i> (Oxford: Oxford <br>
University Press, 2015). Incidentally, amodal completion, as illustrated by Kanizsa triangles, is not to be confused <br>
with a psychological state’s being amodal. Kanizsa figures occur within the visual modality. They even produce <br>
visual modal effects. The area in an amodally completed figure appears brighter than its surround. Amodal com-<br>
pletion is called ‘amodal’ because no visually perceived edges mark all boundaries of the triangles. Amodality in a <br>
representational state, as I use the term, is representation without any sensory medium that is constitutive to the <br>
representation. Amodality is also to be strictly distinguished from inter-modality. All modal perceptual systems <br>
in complex animals with more than one perceptual modality enter into inter-modal relations. Vision is com-<br>
monly affected by proprioception and hearing, for example. <i>Some</i> visual tasks depend essentially on input from <br>
other sensory modalities.</div>
