orientation commonly involves determining the distance or ordinal depth of various <br>
shape parts with respect the viewer. For example, to determine the shape of a rectangular <br>
surface, the system relies, when it can, partly on determining the relation between the <br>
distance of the shape’s top and the distance of the shape’s bottom. If the top is farther away <br>
than the bottom, the retinal image will be very different from what it would be if the top <br>
and bottom were equidistant. The visual system compensates for this variation and repre-<br>
sents the shape as rectangular. Orientation can also be determined through regular differ-<br>
ences in the retinal image that correspond to textural features.88<br>
<br>
Size constancy works off numerous cues, and is subject to many confounds from <br>
noise.89 It is, however, is much less complex than shape constancy. The latter is so complex <br>
that even basic mechanisms are not yet well understood. The number of possible shapes <br>
that mammalian visual systems can determine and the number of orientations that any <br>
given shape can be in is seriously large. There are disputes on almost every important issue <br>
in the field.90 However, the <i>types</i> of mechanism that have been proposed to account <br>
for shape constancy are relevant to understanding perceptual categorization, central to <br>
Part III, and understanding the relation between perception and other closely related <br>
capacities, Part IV.<br>
<br>
In the remainder of the book, I assume that visual perceptual systems have many spatial <br>
constancies. When I cite theories about how computations carry out such constancies,  <br>
I do so mainly for illustration. It is likely that no present theory is close to the last word, <br>
especially on shape representation. Any correct theory will likely take insights from cur-<br>
rent proposals. So it is important that the reader take <i>details</i> with a grain of salt and think <br>
of them as examples of processes that might well occur in perception-formation.<br><br>

<b>Visual Body Categorization<br><br>
</div>
</b>A primary task of mammalian vision is to categorize particulars as bodies by their spatial <br>
characteristics, principally their shape, size, and motion. There are perceptual constancies <br>
for body and body types. But they are, I think, entirely derivative from other constan-<br>
cies—principally shape constancy and motion constancy. Since categorization of bodies is <br>
so prominent in mammalian vision, I make some overview remarks about it in this <br><br>

does not extend beyond about 3 meters in humans, and that most of our size estimation depends on non-<br>
perceptual background knowledge. See C. Granrud, ‘Judging the Size of a Distant Object: Strategy Use by <br>

on experiments that use impoverished cues in artificial experimental circumstances. For work that suggests <br>
resources for perceptual size constancy (always approximate) at greater distances, see B. Gillam, S. Palmisano, <br>
