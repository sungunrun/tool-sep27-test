ways—all representing, indicating, and attributing, the attribute. The system’s being com-<br>
mitted to one attribute is shown in the system’s perceptual and actional, or reactive, <br>
responses.<br>
<br>
Both sameness of what is represented (the attribute) and difference in how the attribute <br>
is presented are coded in the perceptual system. Different perceptual-state-types are com-<br>
mitted to a single given attribute. The different attributives exercised in a perceptual con-<br>
stancy code (by indicating and attributing) the given attribute. The sameness of attribute <br>
in the different attributives is coded <i>in the semantics</i> of the different attributives, not in any <br>
one state or representational content.<br>
<br>
To make the point concrete, let us return to the edge-length example. Each of the per-<br>
ceptual states that responds to the edge at different slants represents the edge as being an <br>
edge and as having <i>length l</i>. Each attributive in the different states indicates and attributes <br>
the kind <i>edge</i> or the property <i>length l</i> in the different stimulus conditions. The attributives <br>
are different, just as the representational contents of the terms are different in Frege’s (a-b) <br>
cases. Unlike Frege’s (a-b) cases, the sameness of <i>representata</i> is coded into the content of <br>
the attributives. The constancy that centers on length codes the sameness in the different <br>
length attributives.<br>
<br>
This is a difference between perception and Frege’s case. Although <i>a</i> and <i>b</i> in fact have <br>
the same referent, that sameness is not coded into the representational content of <i>a</i> or <i>b</i>. <br>
There is nothing in the representational contents the morning star and the evening <br>
star that commits to their referring to the same entity. One could use the terms or the <br>
representational contents competently and never have a commitment on whether they <br>
share a referent. I discuss this difference in this chapter, the section Perceptual Units <br>
in Packages in Iconic Visual Spatial Representation.<br><br>

<b>Minimalism: Defocus and Color Constancy<br><br>
</div>
</b>So far I have supported the view:<br><br>
(I) If a perceptual constancy centers on an attribute, then distinct exercises of the <br>
<br>
constancy, prompted by differing proximal inputs, commonly yield perceptual states <br>
<br>
featuring distinct perceptual attributives that represent the same physical attribute.<br><br>
Let us pursue our edge-length example. Different perceptions as of an edge derive from <br>
the different stimulus conditions. They derive from perceiving an edge at different orien ta-<br>
tions or distances. (I) holds that different perceptual attributives occur in the different <br>
perceptual states.<br>
<br>
I call one way of elaborating (I) ‘minimalism’.207 This elaboration states correctly that <br>
when a perceptual attribution of <i>edge</i> occurs, there are normally simultaneous attributions <br>
of <i>length</i>, <i>shape</i>, and <i>slant</i>. The minimalist holds that the only difference in representa-<br>
tional content resides in the difference in representation of these other attributes. There is <br><br>

Peacocke: Perceptual Content in Light of Perceptual Constancies and Biological Constraints’, <i>Philosophy and <br>
Phenomenological Research</i> 88 (2014), 485–501. I am indebted to Michael Rescorla for raising the issue. Some of <br>
the ideas in early sections in this chapter were broached in my reply article.</div>
