In what way does (LOT*) suppose that perceptual psychology needs supplementation? <br>
In what way is it incompatible with taking the science at face value?<br>
<br>
There are, of course, neural underpinnings to the computations on perceptual states’ <br>
representational structures. Psychological states, computations on representational items, <br>
and causation involving psychological states would not occur without the underlying <br>
physical states and their causal interactions. Without such underpinnings, the psy cho-<br>
logic al computations in actual psychological beings would not occur. The underlying <br>
neur al states, may be what they are independently of any relation to representational prop-<br>
erties. Why should one not take computations on the psychological states to be op er ations <br>
on these neural elements in structure? Why should one not take neural states to be the <br>
syntactical items that (LOT*) postulates?<br>
<br>
It is important to see what a high-wire act these ideas engage in. Especially for op er-<br>
ations in the perceptual system that involve perceptual states, there are not even detailed <br>
correlations between whole psychological states and neural states. There is no detailed <br>
structural mapping between <i>sub-parts</i> of psychological states (in particular, the attributives <br>
that they include) and sub-parts of corresponding neural states. We understand the struc-<br>
ture of the psychological states, and of the representational functions and competencies <br>
that those states exhibit. Our grip on the form and structure of representation in perceptual <br>
states is entirely dependent on our understanding of the representational functions and <br>
representational competencies associated with those states. We have no comparable <br>
account of the structure of neural states that finds exact analogs of representational struc-<br>
tures in the neural states. There is no developed or scientifically supported “syntax” for <br>
neural states. There is no content-independent syntax in either neuro-science or perceptual <br>
psychology. The only syntax-like structure in the science is understood in representational <br>
terms. So the idea that there is a further syntax or further symbolic form that is what it is <br>
independently of representational properties has no scientific support. Of course, the sci-<br>
ence may change so as to postulate one. So far, there is no reason to think that it will.<br>
<br>
There is a natural sense in which neural states are vehicles of content. The sense is made <br>
vivid by reflecting on ways that neural states can be mapped onto aspects of the retinal <br>
image, and sometimes onto aspects of spatial relations among entities in the distal en vir-<br>
on ment. (See Chapter 9, the section Iconic ASPectS of PercePtual SPatial <br>
RePreSentation.) The positions in some neural maps correspond to positions in space. <br>
Patterns of firings in certain neural areas correspond broadly to types of attributes in the <br>
distal environment. It is natural, perhaps correct, to regard such neural arrays as vehicles <br>
of either non-perceptual registration or perceptual content.<br>
<br>
Neural patterns of that sort are necessary to perceptual process. There would be no rep-<br>
resentational content in perception if there were no neural states. There is a causal account <br>
in neural terms that begins at the same place that the representational account begins—<br>
with the registration of proximal stimulation. At each processing stage in the representa-<br>
tional account there is a stage of neural changes that make possible the changes in the <br>
formation of new pre-perceptual registrations or perceptual representations.<br>
<br>
The known scientific <i>causal</i> accounts of these changes are, however, in neural terms and <br>
registrational/representational terms respectively. There is no intermediate, syntactical <br>
science. There is no science that individuates its state-instances and change-instances in <br>
purely syntactic terms—that is, in terms that take items to be representational, but abstract </div>
