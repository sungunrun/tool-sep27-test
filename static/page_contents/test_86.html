86 perceptual constancy</div>
<br><br>
The result of the overall computation is to group registrations of edge segments in the <br>
retinal image as parts of whole contours, including contours that are broken.<br>
<br>
Let us compare this computation to computations involved in a perceptual constancy. <br>
Recall the non-definitional, rough explication of ‘perceptual constancy’:<br><br>
Perceptual constancies are perceptual capacities systematically to represent a given en vir-<br>
<br>
on men tal particular or attribute <i>as</i> that particular or attribute under significant differ-<br>
<br>
ences in registration of proximal stimulation.<br><br>
First, prima facie similarities. There is certainly an invariance at each stage of the com-<br>
putation. Different registrations of proximal stimulation could all lead to registration of a <br>
single type of contour. A contour registration could derive by the same computational <br>
laws from different combinations in the proximal stimulus of polarity, orientation, dis-<br>
tance between broken line segments, and orientation of line segments. Even a retinal con-<br>
tour of a given length, shape, and orientation, with a given break, could be formed from <br>
different proximal stimuli. Such retinal contours are certainly caused by environmental <br>
contours. Why is there no perceptual constancy for the attribute <i>environmental contour</i>?<br>
<br>
One might haggle over whether these differences in proximal stimulation are “signifi-<br>
cant”, as the explication of ‘perceptual constancy’ requires. Apart from more specific <br>
account, merely intuitive differences cannot bear much weight.<br>
<br>
There is, of course, a regular correspondence as well as causal dependence between the <br>
registration of the contour type and not only an attribute in the retinal image, but, more <br>
distantly, environmental contours—contours that are edges of objects, or features in tex-<br>
ture patterns. Further, the environmental contours surely played the primary role in caus-<br>
ing, through patterns of interaction with organisms over eons, computational operations <br>
in visual systems to take the form that they take, and produce the outputs that they prod-<br>
uce. These processes evolved because they aided survival, and because survival depended <br>
partly on discerning contour edges—of bodies, for example—in the environment. Why <br>
does the science not take the registrations to be perceptual?<br>
<br>
I have heard one scientist, in off-the-cuff remarks, suggest a picture that encourages <br>
doing so. That scientist maintained that there is no real distinction between operations <br>
that realize perceptual constancies and those that realize “constancies” or invariances that <br>
are not considered perceptual. According to the view, each process gets one “closer” to <br>
accurate “representation” of the world. ‘Representation’, in the scare-quoted (double-<br>
quotation) sense, is taken to be statistical correlation between a type of neural firing (or <br>
type of psychological state) and an environmental feature, assuming that the correlation <br>
has a biological function. Invoking language like ‘perception’ or ‘veridicality condition’ <br>
might be then said to be just an arbitrary imposition. On this account, once <i>any</i> sort of <br>
processing begins, one has better “representation” than the initial retinal sensory regis tra-<br>
tion. Invoking an important difference between so-called perceptual constancies and any <br>
other invariance in the sensory process is, on this view, an error.<br>
<br>
This view is not the standard understanding in the science. It is an off-the-cuff reduc-<br>
tionism that assimilates perceptual psychology to a biological science in which there is no <br>
distinctively psychological notion of representation. “Representation”, on this reductionist <br>
view, <i>amounts</i> to information registration, with better or less-good correlations to the <br>
environment.</div>
