Egocentric Temporal Frameworks and Motion 271</div>

present set by the whole perception. The content that represents this time interval is the <br>
analog of present tense. It has egocentric implications. The same point applies to the ego-<br>
centric character of the indexical referential application, p, for place.<br>
<br>
The second temporal index refers to an interval that begins with a secondary present <br>
time, t1. The interval extends from t1 to t1+n (for some measured temporal unit, n). <br>
T1 marks the starting point for a timing of movement and trajectory of the perceived body. <br>
I am supposing that the motion begins at t1, after onset of the perception. Since t is the <br>
present interval of the whole perception, the beginning, t1, of this present interval is later <br>
than that of the interval t, but before the end of the interval t. I take the entire interval <br>
that t1 begins also to occur within the primary present time t. In principle, the secondary <br>
present time could be an interval that starts within the primary interval and continues <br>
beyond it. The index now xt1 . . . is a representer-centered, but not egocentric, index.<br>
<br>
I take LocL(c)(_, _, _) and LocL1(c)(_, _, _) to be complex attributives that attribute specific <br>
positions, L and L1, respectively, within a matrix-like iconic spatial framework. ‘LocL(c)(x4, <br>
xp, t1)’ is to be read: x4, located at L. relative to origin xp, at time t1. Those locations are not <br>
represented by referential applications, because they are not perceived or independently <br>
singled out indexically. They are part of a spatial framework that is applied whenever <br>
 here-cego is applied. LocL attributes a position, in a larger network of positions, to per-<br>
ceived particulars, in this case, the perceived movement event, referred to by that x4. The <br>
complex Loc attributives are as fine-grained as discriminable distances and directions are. <br>
The designated locations, L and L1 (relative to the framework’s origin) are composites of <br>
met ric al ly determined distance and direction relations, computed from the anchor pos-<br>
ition that is indexically referred to by here-cego xp.<br>
<br>
Place designations like L and L1 never occur in perceptual representational contents <br>
except as parts of a Loc attributive. In fact, they are constant elements in the overall spatial <br>
framework, which (ideally) is mapped by a single, complex, iconic, map-like framework <br>
attributive. That is, L and L1 are really constant aspects of a huge spatial framework at tribu-<br>
tive. That is why L and L1, which appear here as constants, are not instances of a new cat-<br>
egory of representational element in perception, beyond the three (attributives, schematic <br>
indexes, and referential applications) that I claim are the only structural elements in per-<br>
ceptual representation.<br>
<br>
Thus LocL is just a fragment of a large spatial framework attributive. Actual Loc-type <br>
attributives in perception cover many more positions of many more particulars than are <br>
covered in the present simplified example. Perceptual states may not marshal the psy cho-<br>
logic al system’s full spatial mapping competence in each instance of spatial representation. <br>
Even so, Loc-like attributives in actual perceptions are vastly more systematic and com-<br>
plex than the Loc attributives presented here.<br>
<br>
The widest-scope referential applications, that x1 and that x4, pick out the psy cho logic-<br>
al ly primary particulars in the context. Here, I take the particulars to be a body and a <br>
motion event. The applications, that x2 and that x3, function to refer to color-instances and <br>
shape-instances. The motion event is perceived as being by the body. This byz3 attributive <br>
is of some importance. I believe that an analog eventually shows up as an attributive for a <br>
thematic relation in the theta-structure of early propositional attitudes and early sentences <br>
of language users. Perceptual attributives for the <i>by</i> relation indicate perhaps the most <br>
basic thematic relation. Further attributives for thematic relations emerge with representa-<br>
tion of action—probably initially perceptual representation of action. The <i>by</i> relation </div>
