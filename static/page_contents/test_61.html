Perceptual Constancy—First Mark of Mind 61</div>
<br><br>
variety of weighted conative states (“preferences”) makes mind. But nearly all action, even <br>
action not caused by representational states, can be plausibly modeled as involving a <br>
Bayesian weighting of conative states—states that function to cause the action. Different <br>
actions ensue, depending on sensory input. Nothing distinctive to mind need be involved.<br>
<br>
An alternative that some have taken to be a candidate for a first mark of mind derives <br>
from Kim Sterelny’s work. I believe that this alternative is likewise not a serious contender.52<br>
<br>
The suggestion is that mind emerges when sensory systems use two cues rather than <br>
one to determine a sensory state. The idea is that combination of cues is the mark of <br>
representational mind. By contrast, when an animal relies on a single type of stimulus <br>
that signals just the presence or absence of some feature or features of the environment, <br>
its behavior is so inflexible that its states can be explained in ways that do not suggest <br>
representation or mind:<br><br>
A detection agent is an organism equipped with only detection systems. Such organisms <br>
<br>
have control systems which enable them to track . . . salient features of their environment. <br>
<br>
But they do so via a single channel. For each feature of the environment that they register, <br>
<br>
they use only a single cue.53<br><br>
The relevant notion of a single cue in this suggestion turns out not to be simple. Sterelny <br>
takes counting cues to be easy when they arrive through different sensory modalities—<br>
say, hearing, touch, and vision. But a single cue in a single modality can be a combination <br>
of stimuli that come from different environmental features. For example, Sterelny takes a <br>
chicken to engage in a single-cue-based alarm-call response, even though the response <br>
depends on stimuli deriving from shape, size, and velocity of a predator bird. The idea is <br>
that there is a single <i>combination</i> of the three factors that yields maximum alarm call. <br>
Moreover, Sterelny rightly allows for “stimulus generalization”, in which physically differ-<br>
ent stimuli are functionally equivalent.<br>
<br>
The key idea is that a response is single-cue-bound if it depends on a single optimum <br>
cue, a proximal stimulus that elicits the strongest response. By contrast, a response is not <br>
single-cue-bound if strongest response can be caused by multiple optimum cues. A nat-<br>
ural inference from this distinction is that if all an animal’s responses are single-cue-bound <br>
in this sense, the animal has a mere detection system, a system merely for information <br>
registration, not a genuinely representational system. Sterelny does not draw this <br><br>

<b>FOOTNOTES</b><br>
<b>Cont FN</b>52 The suggestion is drawn from K. Sterelny, <i>Thought in a Hostile World</i> (Oxford: Blackwell, 2003). It would <br>
not be fair to Sterelny to take him as proposing competitors to perceptual constancy. He provides no serious <br>
discussion of perceptual constancy or perception, and says little about what is actually known in psychology <br>
about sensory systems and their relations to action. He is less interested in psychology than in the evolutionary <br>
emergence of flexibility in behavior. The suggestion that I discuss has been taken, not by Sterelny but by others, <br>
as an alternative to perceptual constancy. Sterelny avoids any commitment to the view that primitive animals, <br>
well below primates, have what “folk psychology” or “intentional psychology” counts as minds (see his chapters <br>
1 and 11.) He focuses on the emergence of belief-desire psychology for humans. I believe that these differences <br>
from the present approach are drawbacks, insofar as the approach is taken to cast light on emergence of repre-<br>
sentational mind. One cannot understand such emergence if what is known in perceptual psychology and sen-<br>
sori motor psychology is ignored. Sterelny tends to form views about an animal’s psychology on the basis of one <br>
or two evolutionarily interesting tasks—such as avoiding a predator or giving an alarm call. To understand an <br>
animal’s psychology, one must investigate a vastly greater range of behavior. Sterelny’s approach does produce <br>
insights into social aspects of the evolution of representation. Most of these aspects emerge much later than the <br>
most primitive types of representational mind.<br>
