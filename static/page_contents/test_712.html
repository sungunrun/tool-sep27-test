There are rules of thumb for distinguishing conscious and unconscious psychological <br>
states and processes. But the rules so far stated are too coarse and counter-example-ridden <br>
to support delineation of systems as psychological natural kinds.<br>
<br>
I have explored a conception of psychological systems as computational systems with a <br>
limited set of inputs. One such system includes formation of visual perceptual states, <br>
including perceptual categorization, probably attribution of causation and agency, and <br>
attribution of functional phenomena, like <i>food</i>, <i>shelter</i>, <i>prey</i>, <i>mate</i>—at various levels of <br>
specificity. Perception-formation comprises perceptual states within a sensory modality, <br>
like vision, and of course inter-modal connections, such as those between proprioception <br>
and vision. The visual system produces input into the motor system, and receives feed-<br>
back from the motor system. It includes exogenous and endogenous applications of per-<br>
ceptual attention, and other perceptual and motor aspects of executive control. The visual <br>
system and the visuo-motor system include production of and input from various types <br>
of perceptual memory, from perceptual learning, perceptual-level affect, and perceptual <br>
anticipation. All these patterns are subject to computational explanation. None of the <br>
standard computational explanations postulate propositional states, or their conceptual <br>
components, as input. It seems possible that, even if this fact holds, some propositional <br>
states may be computational outputs—for example, overridable formations of perceptual <br>
beliefs.<br>
<br>
Another computational system centers on formation and execution of motor com-<br>
mands. It takes many inputs from perceptual systems.<br>
<br>
Although computational system is an important basis for calling a psychological com-<br>
petence a system, there are others. In fact, I think that the most consistently valuable basis <br>
for differentiating psychological kinds is information-registrational and representational <br>
<i>function</i>.<br>
<br>
There are various functional bases for counting a competence a system. For example, <br>
the visual system is a competence that functions to form visual perceptions. Pre-perceptual <br>
stages of visual processing comprise a sub-system, a competence that functions to register <br>
properties of the retinal image that are subsequently used in forming visual perceptions. A <br>
specialized sub-system of the visual perceptual system functions to produce perceptions <br>
of faces, with a further sub-system that functions to register familiarity.<br>
<br>
The visual system, so understood, is a sub-system within the perceptual-level, inter-<br>
modal, perceptual-motor, computational system. The visual system is not individuated <br>
entirely by specifically visual (retinal) inputs—it takes inputs from other modalities—<br>
although it is perhaps distinctive in being capable of producing perceptual representations <br>
with only visual inputs, and incapable of operating, naturally and without adaptation, <br>
without them. It certainly bears computational relations to other sensory inputs (for <br>
example proprioceptive ones) and to inputs from non-perceptual competencies (for <br>
example, memory). There is, however, specialization in its function. Such specialization <br>
marks it as a psychological kind.<br>
<br>
It is imaginable that all psychology could be computational. The functional bases for <br>
individuating systems would remain. I think it a mistake to regard computation (or modu-<br>
lar ity, however characterized) as the only, or even main, distinguishing feature of psy cho-<br>
logic al systems.<br>
<br>
There are yet further ways of demarcating systems. There is little recurrent feedback <br>
from endogenous attention, memory, and so on, in the first 150 ms of visual processing. </div>
