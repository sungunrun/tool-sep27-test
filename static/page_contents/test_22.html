22 Perception</div>
<br><br>
I begin with the broad use of ‘representation’. This use is prevalent in various areas of <br>
biology. I use a different term, in order to distinguish between this use and the use that is <br>
central to our understanding of perception and other forms of representational mind. The <br>
term for the very broad use of ‘representation’ that I use is ‘<i>information registration</i>’.<br>
<br>
Information registration is grounded in a phenomenon articulated in Shannon informa-<br>
tion theory.19 Information is a type of statistical correlation between repeatable states or <br>
properties.<br><br>
<i>x</i> <i>carries</i> <i>information about</i> <i>y</i> if and only if <i>x</i> is statistically correlated with <i>y</i> to some <br>
<br>
rele vant degree.<br><br>
Note that the <i>carries information about</i> relation is symmetrical. If <i>x</i> carries information <br>
about <i>y</i>, then <i>y</i> carries information about <i>x</i>. This relation itself is, of course, not specific to <br>
mind. It is a completely general notion of statistical correlation. To render this broad <br>
notion of information useful for the biological sciences, it is well to supplement it with two <br>
further conditions.<br>
<br>
One is a causal or nomological condition. Let us say that<br><br>
<i>x carries</i> <i>causally dependent information about</i> <i>y</i> if and only if <i>x</i> carries information <br>
<br>
about <i>y</i> and <i>x</i> is causally or nomologically dependent on <i>y</i>.<br><br>
This condition gives us an asymmetrical information relation.<br>
<br>
Suppose that in winter a rooster crows every morning at 6 am in Shanghai and that a <br>
certain church bell rings every afternoon at 5 pm in Boston. Suppose that these events <br>
occur at the same time. There is no causal or nomological relation between the two. <br>
However, each of the two types of events—the rooster crowing and the church bell’s ring-<br>
ing—are statistically correlated. So each event carries information about the other. To <br>
understand an example of the causal or nomological condition just stated, suppose that <br>
every afternoon, the sun casts a shadow off a certain rock. The shadow is caused by the <br>
sun’s shining from a specific position in the sky. Then the shadow carries causally <br>
 dependent information about the sun’s shining from that position. Obviously, neither of <br>
these information relations is specific to mind or even to life.<br>
<br>
A second condition that supplements the information-carrying relation appeals to function. <br>
This condition gets us to the broad use of ‘representation’ that I call ‘information registration’:<br><br>
<i>x registers information about y</i> if and only if <i>x</i> carries causally dependent information <br>
<br>
about <i>y</i>, and <i>x</i>’s carrying causally dependent information about y is functional for <i>x</i> <br>
<br>
or for some system or individual that contains <i>x</i>.<br><br>
Perceiving something requires being in a causal relation to it. Sensing something usu-<br>
ally involves being in a causal relation to it, but not necessarily. An individual can sense <br>
something by having a state that informationally registers it. Informational registration <br>
does not require that whatever is sensed causes the sensing, although this is often true. <br><br>
