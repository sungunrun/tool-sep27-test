“grabbed” by a stimulus, whereas endogenous attention, though often triggered by a stimu-<br>
lus, is guided primarily by antecedent states. Exogenous attention tends to be transient, <br>
lasting on the order of 120+ ms. It is sometimes dubbed ‘transient attention’. Endogenous <br>
attention can be maintained, sometimes as long as a task requires.<br>
<br>
The onset of exogenous attention is very fast. Some stimuli (say, fast motion) cause <br>
selection almost immediately after stimulus onset. Neural support for initiating exogenous <br>
attention is present in the earliest visual areas. Endogenous spatial attention can be applied <br>
before a relevant stimulus occurs. When its initiation is posterior to a stimulus, it is often <br>
applied relatively late in the processing sequence, at 160 ms or later, although some <br>
en dogen ous attention is initiated and has its effects on visual processing a good bit earlier. <br>
(See this chapter, the section Perceptual-Level Attention Commands and <br>
Guidance of Saccades.)<br>
<br>
Vision scientists used to think that initiation of endogenous attention is supported only <br>
by activity in advanced cortical areas and has its effects only on relatively fully formed <br>
aspects of visual processing. This view is many ways mistaken. Application of endogenous <br>
spatial attention depends on sub-cortical areas as well as more advanced areas, though it is <br>
probably <i>initiated</i>  in anatomically high cortical areas. Its effects occur in the earliest cor-<br>
tical visual areas, V1 and V2.731<br>
<br>
<i>Feature-based attention</i> is selection by registration or representation of properties. <br>
Perceivers often need to be sensitive to, or to search for, a property, while lacking a sense <br>
for the property’s location. In contrast to spatial attention, feature-based attention is <br>
applied simultaneously across the whole visual field. It affects visual processing even in <br>
locations that are irrelevant to a current visual task.732 Feature-based attention was ini-<br>
tially distinguished from spatial attention by having subjects focus on a given area that <br>
contained two patterns of motion. Various adaptation-like aftereffects were stronger for <br>
the selected type of motion than for the unselected type.733 The effects of feature-based <br>
attention are not limited to an area selected by endogenous spatial attention. Encoding <br><br>

<b>FOOTNOTES</b><br>
<b>Cont FN</b>A lot of <i>endogenous attention</i>, attention predominantly caused by internal, central psychological factors, to use <br>
Posner’s characterization, is automatic, unconscious, and hardly the result of volition. For example, some <br>
en dogen ous attention-shifts automatically follow internally scheduled, default-types of scanning, according to <br>
priority maps. The individual can take over and control the scanning, but frequently does not. Endogenous atten-<br>
tion depends on memory and on what task is performed. In such cases, initiation of endogenous attention need <br>
not be under individual control. So, on the Posner characterization, some endogenous visual attention is active; <br>
some is not. Even if one were to use Carrasco’s characterization of endogenous attention, the notion of voluntari-<br>
ness would have to be understood to apply to different levels of initiation—perceptual-level attention commands <br>
as well as propositional-level intentions. I elaborate such points, this chapter, the sections Perceptual-Level <br>
Attention Commands Guiding Saccades and The Executive Control System, and <br>
Propositional Drivers.<br>
