in a causal chain, be propositional. Computational models that explain relatively primitive <br>
action in humans begin with the perceptual states and perceptual-level targeting state. The <br>
models work, whether or not the targeting state is itself caused by an antecedent set of <br>
beliefs and propositional-level intentions.<br>
<br>
Adjustments resulting from feedback—even in action initiated by a propositional-level <br>
intention—are probably not normally caused by propositional-level intentions. Imagine <br>
that a target-setting state engenders a motor command. As the command is issued, the <br>
target moves. In response to feedback from efference copy and vision, a new motor com-<br>
mand changes the reach’s trajectory. All this happens quickly. The subject is unaware of <br>
the changed trajectory. The action is guided by the new command, which in turn is guided <br>
by perception and efference copy. Propositional states need not figure in these adjust-<br>
ments. There may be too little time to reason. The change in the hand’s trajectory is not <br>
specified by the initial targeting state, or by any antecedent propositional-level intention. <br>
The change in trajectory is an act, not a reflex. It is initiated by a central, albeit uncon-<br>
scious, conative state. It is not plausible that such a state is always propositional.<br>
<br>
Nothing in psychological modeling of motor control requires that either the initial <br>
target-setting state or the sequence of motor commands be propositional. Successful, math-<br>
ematically rigorous explanations of such human action do not need postulations of prop os-<br>
ition al states. Insisting on intentions postulates an idle wheel, except when there is specific <br>
reason to believe that a propositional-level intention figures in the full causal explanation.<br>
<br>
These reflections not only raise caution about intentionalist accounts of action, even <br>
human action. They raise caution about intuitive judgments about whether some events <br>
are actions.726 Suppose that one ducks at a fast oncoming object—even though one had <br>
planned not to because one knows that a glass shield will block the object. Suppose that <br>
one’s involuntary ducking is guided by perception, and is not a muscle reflex. The move-<br>
ment is explained by the system of motor control just sketched. Many adults would find it <br>
unclear whether the ducking motion is an act. Many, including many philosophers, <br>
respond this way because they fail to recognize how much action is not psychologically <br>
guided at all. Many also overrate the role of conscious planning and conscious intentions <br>
in action. Most do not know how fast and unconscious the operations of psychological <br>
systems are. Such background deprives many intuitive judgments of weight. The idea that <br><br>

<b>FN</b>726 For discussion of instinctual action guided by perception, see Burge, <i>Origins of Objectivity</i>, 335–341. Many <br>
cases of ducking that fit the text’s example are probably instinctual action, not reflexes. For a different take on <br>
cases like the ducking case, see B. Nanay, <i>Between Perception and Action</i> (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2013), <br>
81–86. Although elsewhere Nanay makes good use of psychology, he relies here on intuitive grounds to judge <br>
that such cases are ‘semi-actions’, not clear-cut actions at all. He holds that although the movement is representa-<br>
tionally guided, there is no conative initiating state. These claims are unsupported. The representationally guided <br>
movement is initiated by states that function to cause the movement, by mechanisms known in sensorimotor <br>
psychology. That is what conative states are. Although there is surely a fuzzy border somewhere between action <br>
and non-action, I think that there is no fuzz in perception-guided ducking cases. Reflexes are clearly not actions. <br>
The ducking, about which many intuitive judgments would be unclear, is, or can be, clear-cut action. The central <br>
mechanisms for generating normal fast motor behavior are intact. They are initiated by a target-setting state, <br>
guided by perception, that produces representationally controlled behavior.<br>
<br>
Cases that have been labeled ‘<i>alien hand syndrome</i>’ are also mostly actions. The operations of the actional sys-<br>
tem are again intact. Motor production is appropriate to and guided by perception of specific aspects of the <br>
environment at which they are directed. Execution of movement is fluent. Most alien-hand behavior is action <br>
fulfilling target-setting states, even though the behavior is inconsistent with conscious intention and with the <br>
agent’s self-understanding. For excellent discussion of these cases, with a somewhat different focus, see <br>
E. Pacherie, ‘The Anarchic Hand Syndrome and Utilization Behavior: A Window onto Agentive Self-Awareness’, <br>
<i>Functional Neurology</i> 22 (2007), 211–217. Pacherie, also, takes alien-hand behavior to be action.</div>
