about 125 ms, depending on just-cited factors. The endogenous, covert attention-initiations, <br>
(a), are either part of a default-scheduled sequence of attention-shifts that function to <br>
maximize input of information (see note 793) or, very frequently, causally influenced by (d) <br>
specific contextual task-orientations—conative states that are either, (d1), pre-<br>
representational, or (d2) representational. The pre-representational conative states can be <br>
responsive to present stimuli or influenced by past sets. The representational conative <br>
states, (d2), can be either responsive mainly to present stimuli and present action targets, <br>
(d2a), or memory-mediated, often long-term-memory-mediated, by past action-targeting <br>
states or past rewards, (d2b). The huge number of unconscious covert en dogen ous atten-<br>
tion shifts and saccades that occur every minute strongly suggests that many of them are <br>
not under individual control. This point supports the first of the three points made at the <br>
end of the preceding section, Sources and Levels of Attention: Internal factors <br>
that cause endogenous attention are sometimes not under the individual’s control.<br>
<br>
All states so far mentioned are perceptual-level, or lower. They are perceptual-level or lower <br>
because the representational operations involved are not more sophisticated than those <br>
involved in perceptual processing, and because the representational contents of states in these <br>
operations contain iconic perceptual attributives. The representational attentional, conative, <br>
and memory states involved contain perceptual representational contents because they are <br>
naturally fitted in content and format-structure to the perceptual states that they guide, are <br>
guided by, or retain. They all enter into a single perceptual-level computational system.<br>
<br>
The representational attention initiations, (a2), the representational conative states, <br>
(d2), and the perceptual memories affecting (a2) and (d2), can all be caused by supra-<br>
perceptual-level states, (e), including propositional-level states. In such cases, they are cog-<br>
nitively driven.792 In such cases, saccade initiations, (b), and perceptual processing, (c), are <br>
also indirectly causally affected by cognitive states. Although such cases are normal, they <br>
are not omnipresent and probably occur in a small proportion of cases. The attentional <br><br>

<b>FN</b>792 I believe that the described timing results are probably incompatible with the view of Raftopoulos, <br>
<i>Cognitive Impenetrability and the Epistemic Role of Perception</i> that processing in “early vision” is impervious to <br>
causal effects by cognitive states. Raftopoulos discusses FEF and its role in “early vision”, chapter 3. He concludes <br>
that cognition does not affect visual processing until after 150 ms from stimulus-onset. However, faster speeds of <br>
task-oriented endogenous attention affecting V4 have been recorded, after the very speediest feed-forward sweep <br>
that reaches V4 and IT by 60–80 ms, but well within 150 ms, even within 100 ms. The fast effects are not limited <br>
to pre-cuing that shifts receptor settings or other aspects of pre-representational vision. They include effects via <br>
long-term perceptual memory. Most of the work that I describe has been done on monkeys, whose systems tend <br>
to be slightly faster than those of humans. But the difference is not likely to affect the general point. Given that <br>
the experiments have been done mainly on monkeys, and given that it is not clear just what supra-perceptual-<br>
level powers monkeys have, it has not been shown that the effects through long-term memory (or more directly <br>
through attention, responding to task-relevant aspects of present stimuli) can have indirect, antecedent cognitive <br>
causes. I think it nearly certain, though, that comparable effects at comparable speeds occur in humans, in which <br>
the long-term perceptual memories or the perceptual-level attention commands have been affected, pre-stimulus, <br>
by antecedent propositional-level memories or propositional conative states (propositional-level intentions and <br>
propositional attention commands). The initial attentional input is not recurrent but feed-forward. It is certainly <br>
not anatomically local, given anatomical distance between FEF and V4 (and indeed, FEF and MT). The direct <br>
input into V4 is local in the sense that it is internal to the visual system. I think that the same point applies to <br>
perceptual-level attentional commands supported in parietal areas after 150 ms, and their input of endogenous <br>
attention into V4 and IT. Both FEF and parietal endogenous attentional input, though perceptual-level, can have <br>
antecedent cognitive, even propositional, “drivers”. The drivers are almost always in place before stimulus onset, <br>
but their effect is on visual processing, not just antecedent processing sets. Incidentally, Raftopoulos mistakenly <br>
reports interaction between FEF and V1 (192). The interactions are so sparse as to be doubtfully functional (per-<br>
sonal communication Jeffrey Schall). Raftopoulos bases his account of the role of FEF in visual processing on <br>
literature that is more than ten years old. Despite these points, I think that Raftopoulos is right to stress an <br>
im port ant difference between visual processing up to about 150 ms and visual processing afterwards, in that the <br>
latter is markedly more affected by feedback from memory and attention.</div>
