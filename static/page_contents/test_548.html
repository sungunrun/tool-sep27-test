548 Perceptual Attention</div>
<br><br>
attention initiations are representational, they are <i>attention commands</i>. A representational <br>
motor initiation that functions to cause a saccade is a <i>saccade command</i>, a type of <i>motor <br>
command</i>. Both attention commands and saccade commands are often further guided by <br>
antecedent task-oriented representational conative states stored in memory. Some of these <br>
representational conative states are perceptual level, as are the attention commands and <br>
saccade commands. All these representational states incorporate perceptual attributives <br>
and engage in operations no more advanced than perceptual operations. I shall elaborate <br>
and support these points, in what follows.<br>
<br>
Despite the great speed and frequency at which these unconscious attention shifts <br>
occur, they are not reflexes. They occur in patterns that show the influence of task orienta-<br>
tion, memory of past behavioral success, and selections that obtain the most useful infor-<br>
mation. They are commonly explained representationally—in terms of attention commands, <br>
saccade commands, visual and proprioceptive states themselves, perceptual memory of <br>
perceptual and conative representational states. Such states guide visual search and intra-<br>
saccadic scanning.<br>
<br>
In elaborating these remarks, I first sketch some points about the neural underpinnings of <br>
these representational states. Then I discuss computational models of the psychology involved.<br>
<br>
Endogenous attention, attention initiations, and saccade initiations have neural support <br>
in the frontal eye fields, FEF, an area in the pre-frontal cortex. Neural activity in FEF sup-<br>
porting attention initiations and attention shifts has been distinguished from neural activ-<br>
ity supporting saccade commands.777 Shifts of attention can occur even if no saccade is <br>
initiated. In fact, the neurons in FEF associated with visual attention (“visual neurons”) <br>
and those associated with motor initiations of saccadic movement (“visuomovement <br>
neuro ns”) have been distinguished.778<br>
<br>
FEF receives signals from the retina, at speeds almost as fast as V1 and MT/V5. Some <br>
neurons in FEF respond faster than V1 neurons respond. Every study has found that when <br>
a target is more difficult to locate, neurons in FEF signal its location at least as early and <br>
often earlier than neurons in occipital, parietal, or temporal areas do.779 Most studies have <br>
found that even when a target is easy to locate, attention signals from FEF of the target’s <br>
location are faster than from areas outside the prefrontal cortex.780 This area of the pre-<br>
front al cortex, though anatomically high, produces some of the fastest feedback into early <br><br>
