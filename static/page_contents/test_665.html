Uses and Misuses of the Term ‘Cognition’ 665</div>

representation.1083 So although, in the psychological literature, some uses of ‘knowledge’ <br>
apply to both perceptual-level and supra-perceptual-level representation and do connect <br>
with an or din ary notion, these uses, also, cannot guide reflection to a supra-perceptual <br>
type of representation.<br>
<br>
Russell used ordinary knowledge-by-acquaintance uses of ‘know’ to develop what was <br>
for him a basic theoretical notion.1084 His use, except as applied to acquaintance with uni-<br>
versals, was a surrogate for perception. It would naturally be taken to apply to a psy cho-<br>
logic al state that is at a more primitive representational level than cognition. (Acquaintance <br>
with universals was Russell’s surrogate for understanding concepts, components of pro-<br>
posi tions.) In any case, Russell’s notion of knowledge by acquaintance, as a theoretical <br>
idea, is widely and correctly regarded as too laden with non-viable psychological and epi-<br>
stem ic ideas to be used in current philosophical work.1085<br>
<br>
What I write about perceptual-level representation in Chapters 13–18, and in this chap-<br>
ter, should sharpen one side of the border with cognition, whether or not there is a non-<br>
propositional middle ground between perceptual-level and propositional capacities.<br>
<br>
I do take cognition necessarily to involve either attributives or operations that mark <br>
more sophisticated types of representational competencies than do perceptual attributives <br>
and operations. <i>That</i> is the cash value of taking cognition to be “higher-level” than <br>
perception.<br>
<br>
As in Chapters 13–18, perceptual-level representation comprises more than perception. <br>
It includes perceptual attention, conation guided by other perceptual-level capacities, <br>
perception-based affect, perceptual memory, perceptual learning, perceptual anticipation, <br>
and perceptual imagining. Despite the studied vagueness in my provisional usage of ‘cog-<br>
nition’, I think that we have made progress in understanding some key psychological nat-<br>
ural kinds.<br>
<br>
The discussion that I embark on in this chapter aims to improve scientific uses of ‘per-<br>
ceptual system’ and ‘cognition’. Of course, one can use ‘cognition’ any way one wants. <br>
However, many current uses blur natural psychological kinds and hinder understanding.<br>
<br>
I turn to more detailed criticism of typical uses of the term ‘cognition’. Most uses, like <br>
uses of the term ‘knowledge’, are not seriously explicated. Many unexplicated uses play no <br>
role in the main sections of articles. Often, uses of the term function as a hook or come-<br>
 on. I believe, however, that off-hand uses are not good for science and, in this case, tend to <br>
produce a fog about the larger shape of representational mind. Lack of uniformity in usage <br>
and paucity of serious explication of how “cognition” contrasts with perception are symp-<br>
toms of confusion, in scientific as well as philosophical discussions. The confusion borders <br>
on chaos.<br>
<br>
I discuss three broad uses. I criticize each as failing to yield insight into important dis-<br>
tinctions among psychological kinds. The three uses associate cognition, respectively, with <br>
(1) top-down feedback; (2) representation that includes all categorization and all <br><br>
