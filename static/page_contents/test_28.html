take representational states as of specific distal environmental attributes as basic, unre-<br>
duced factors in a causal, usually computational, explanation. The state will specify a <br>
depth, color or color shade, shape and size, body, face, or the like. Such states set condi-<br>
tions for veridicality. One can ask whether a perceived particular is at the specified depth, <br>
of the specified color shade, and so on. Being open to such questions is being a representa-<br>
tional state that is veridical or non-veridical.<br>
<br>
The explanatory practice of perceptual psychology marks the presence of representation <br>
in the operations and activities of a wide variety of animals. In doing so, it helps delineate <br>
the joint in nature between mind and the mindless. For representation is a mark of mind.<br><br>

<b>Representation and Veridicality Conditions<br><br>
</div>
</b>It is time to be more specific about what representation is. Then I develop how it figures in <br>
perceptual psychology’s explanations.<br>
<br>
A state is <i>representational</i> if and only if it has a veridicality condition as an aspect of its <br>
nature. Saying that a veridicality condition is an aspect of a state’s nature implies that the <br>
veridicality condition is an aspect of the basic explanation-grounding kind that the state is <br>
or instantiates. Representation in this sense bears a constitutive, apriori knowable relation <br>
to veridicality and non-veridicality.<br>
<br>
Other conditions have been claimed to be constitutive of representational states. First, it <br>
has been claimed that a representational state must have a structure that allows de com-<br>
pos ition and that allows the possibility of other states some of whose structural elements <br>
are shared with the first state and others of which differ. Second, it has been claimed that <br>
representational states must be capable of figuring in explanations of “intentional” behav-<br>
ior. Third, it has been claimed that a representational state allows causal integration with <br>
other representational states.<br>
<br>
I think that these three conditions follow apriori from the condition that I stated. The <br>
first condition follows from the fact that all states with veridicality conditions must have a <br>
structure that combines an attributive with a further representational content. The central <br>
ideas involved in this point are discussed in Chapters 5 and 6. (See also Chapter 9, the sec-<br>
tion Some Ways Not to Think about Iconic Representation.) The second <br>
follows from the requirement that a veridicality condition be an aspect of a representa-<br>
tional state’s <i>nature</i>. Being such an aspect is largely <i>determined</i> by the state’s grounding <br>
causal explanation of responses to stimuli, including behavior. The third condition follows <br>
from this same point together with the principle that no psychological competence typed <br>
by a veridicality condition could operate alone. This principle follows from the constitu-<br>
tive dependence of perception on perceptual constancies (see this chapter, the section <br>
Perception as Objectification and Chapter 7, the section Linkage of <br>
Different Perceptual Attributives in Perceptual Constancies), the <br>
constitutive dependence of propositional states on being part of a competence for prop os-<br>
ition al inference, and the constitutive dependence of non-propositional states other than <br>
perception either on perceptual constancies or being part of a competence for prop os-<br>
ition al inference.<br>
<br>
I do not argue these latter points in this book. Specifically, I do not argue that all <br>
 representation constitutively involves attribution, or that propositional states must be </div>
