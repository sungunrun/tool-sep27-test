582 Perceptual Memory: Short-Term Systems</div>
<br><br>
Although I have focused on TSM and on issues of perceptual continuity across sac-<br>
cades, there are parallel psychological and neural mechanisms that safeguard perceptual <br>
continuity by compensating for other sorts of bodily movement that would otherwise tend <br>
to make proximal stimulation of the visual system relatively discontinuous.859<br>
<br>
It should always be remembered that trans-saccadic neural and psychological processes <br>
are complex. Various mechanisms—neural, sensory-pre-perceptual, visual, and proprio-<br>
ceptive—play roles in producing smooth visual representation across jerky saccades and <br>
other bodily movements that make visual reception decidedly unsmooth. The mech an-<br>
isms of visual stability, visual tracking, visual search, and visual support of motor action <br>
are multi-form and interactive. Given the importance of maintaining steady perceptual <br>
tracking, evolution of psychological systems that do not rely on just one mechanism to <br>
safeguard visual-perceptual functions should be expected.<br>
<br>
Let us return to the question of whether TSM is a distinct memory system, or rather an <br>
implementation of the same memory system as visual working memory. The initial com-<br>
parison of TSM with visual working memory depended on considerations of the relative <br>
capacity of each. Using a popular framework of the late 1990s and early 2000s, each was <br>
taken to have a capacity of about 3–4 slots. Slots were taken to correspond to discrete vis-<br>
ual objects. An object’s package of properties—size, shape, color, orientation—was taken <br>
to fit into that object’s slot. I discuss this way of thinking about memory capacity in the <br>
next section. This way of thinking is at best a serious oversimplification. It serves present <br>
purposes. Several experiments did seem to suggest a broadly similar capacity between <br>
TSM and visual working memory. However, many of these experiments suffered the diffi-<br>
culty mentioned earlier. They were not well fitted to conditions in which TSM actually <br>
operates. Many were not ecologically valid.<br>
<br>
More recent evidence suggests that the storage capacity of TSM may have a <i>lower</i> bound <br>
that is roughly quadruple the common rough estimate of the capacity of visual working <br>
memory.860 If this result holds up, it would suggest that TSM is a distinct system from <br>
both iconic memory (which has a vastly larger capacity) and working memory. Because <br>
the evidence is subject to various confounds and has not been developed or replicated, the <br>
issue remains open.<br><br>

Some evidence suggests that spatiotopic retention in TSM is a slow process, and that, although it participates <br>
in visual stabilization, it trails other mechanisms responsible for stability. See E. Zimmermann, M. Morrone, <br>
