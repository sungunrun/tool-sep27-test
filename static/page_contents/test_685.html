Conceptions of Penetration 685</div>

He further writes,<br><br>
We sometimes use the term ‘rational’ in speaking of cognitive processes or cognitive <br>
<br>
influences. This term is meant to indicate that in characterizing such processes we need <br>
<br>
to refer to what the beliefs are about—to their semantics. The paradigm case of such a <br>
<br>
process is inference, where the semantic property truth is preserved. But we also count <br>
<br>
various heuristic reasoning and decision-making strategies (e.g., satisficing, approximat-<br>
<br>
ing, even guessing) as rational because, however sub-optimal they may be by some nor-<br>
<br>
mative criterion, they do not transform representations in a semantically arbitrary way: <br>
<br>
they are in some sense at least quasi-logical. This is the essence of what we mean by cog-<br>
<br>
nitive penetration: it is an influence that is coherent or quasi-rational when the meaning <br>
<br>
of the representation is taken into account.1123<br><br>
Again, the key formulations are unclear. Pylyshyn’s terms ‘quasi-logical’ and ‘at least <br>
quasi-rational’ bespeak a recognized lack of literalness. Pylyshyn wants the “making sense” <br>
to apply to relations among representational states <i>in the psychology</i>. The scope for making <br>
some quasi-logical sense and for conforming to intuitions of quasi-rationality is, however, <br>
very broad. The notions of intelligibility and making sense are too loose to provide scien-<br>
tific guidance.<br>
<br>
Sensitivity to something in a ‘semantically coherent way’ that ‘makes sense’ does rule out <br>
influence by disease or brute causal bumping of a system’s processes. Such causation has <br>
been explored, independently, in philosophical discussions of action. I call such caus ation <br>
‘<i>pathological</i>’. Such influence is not relevant to understanding psychological kinds—<br>
Pylyshyn’s main objective. Beyond that point, it is unclear how to apply these phrases to cases.<br>
<br>
Pylyshyn’s appeals to logical connections are also unclear. Logic is standardly taken to <br>
be the science of principles of logical consequence, where logical consequence is taken <br>
necessarily to preserve truth according to propositional logical form. Pylyshyn wanted to <br>
show, among other things, that states in early vision are not unconsciously argued to from <br>
theory in a premise-conclusion-like format. That picture was suggested by New Look <br>
psych ology. No modern proponents of cognitive penetration take such a format seriously. <br>
I think that understanding the transformations as computations takes a step in the direc-<br>
tion of the comparisons to logic. On the other hand, Pylyshyn’s inclusion of satis fi cing and <br>
guessing in his list suggests that he took relevant relations to be quite broad. I think that <br>
this broadening was a mistake. Pylyshyn’s idea of logical relation is too vague to guide <br>
assessment of cases.<br>
<br>
Similar points apply to Pylyshyn’s appeals to rationality. Rationality and reason are <br>
attributes of propositional operations. Perceptual processing is, by being non-<br>
propositional, not rational. Helmholtz wrote of law-like transformations in the visual sys-<br>
tem as inferences. This term elided the distinction between propositional inference and <br>
the transformations that occur in visual systems—none of which are propositional, and <br>
many of which are not even representational. In my view, rationality is not at issue. Absent <br>
a more detailed account, there is no good guide to what causal relations between cognition <br>
and perception would count as penetration.<br><br>
