Noun-Phrase-Like Structure and Iconic Representation 299</div>
<br><br>
natural structure-preserving mapping between intensity of lightness and intensity of <br>
resistance. Both the system and states within it represent iconically.<br>
<br>
The subject matter into which representational elements are mapped is typically a set of <br>
types indicated by attributives. For example, shapes or shape-like structures in a represen-<br>
tation might be mapped into shapes in the environment, or in abstract mathematical <br>
“space”. Although most iconic mappings relate types of attributives with types of attributes <br>
that they indicate, the elements in the subject matter can be named rather than indicated. <br>
In the match-tank case, the mapping naturally maps some relational form of the attribu-<br>
tives (here, the attributives for spatial relations) into some relation in the subject matter <br>
(the spatial relations among the particular tanks). Names of particulars are iconically <br>
mapped to what they name, if there is some natural relation between a system of names <br>
and the named particulars, or if some feature of the names matches some feature of their <br>
<i>nominata</i>. For example, one could introduce stick-figures colored in ways to match the <br>
color of clothing worn by people in a group that the stick-figures named.<br>
<br>
I mention some further examples of iconic representational content or representation <br>
to which the explication applies.<br>
<br>
A string of strokes can iconically represent natural numbers by the just-as-many-as <br>
mapping from the strokes to the natural numbers leading up to, and including, the num-<br>
ber. Let ‘||||||||’ represent the natural number 8. The strokes do not iconically represent just <br>
by being strokes and being mappable to natural numbers. All representation requires <br>
some possible use. Given that the strokes are intentionally used to represent numbers, <br>
they represent iconically. If one were to remove any stroke from the group, the result <br>
would represent the natural number 7.<br>
<br>
In accord with (1) there is a natural, systematic 1–1 into mapping between the strokes <br>
and the natural numbers beginning with 1. The sub-units of the sequence of strokes are <br>
the individual strokes. The sub-units of the mathematical structure are the natural num-<br>
bers 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. In accord with (2), the size of the collection of strokes is proportionate <br>
to the size of the number represented. The relation of <i>half as many as</i> among strokes cor-<br>
responds to the relation <i>being half of</i> among numbers. In accord with (3), the group of <br>
strokes represents the numbers partly by these mapping relations cited in (1) and (2). <br>
Although I explain the example by reference to the sign ‘||||||||’, I can construe the sign’s <br>
representational content as an abstraction that retains the abstract features of the concrete <br>
series of strokes and that represents natural numbers in the same way.<br>
<br>
Take a simple example of iconic representation of a physical subject matter. Suppose <br>
that the following map represents the light-rail line between the Western Avenue and <br>
USC stops:<br><br>
⦿ —————————— ⦿ —————————— ⦿<br>
<br>
Western Ave.     Vermont Ave.        USC<br><br>
The dots and the positions of the names iconically represent the stations and their relative <br>
positions. The lines iconically represent the relevant portions of the light-rail line. There <br>
are non-iconic elements in this iconic representation. The names for the stops are <br>
non-iconic.<br>
<br>
In accord with (1), there is a natural, systematic 1–1-into mapping from dots to sta-<br>
tions, and from lines to tracks between stations. The natural mapping is spatial. Positions </div>
