Consider the nectar-feeding amakihi bird in Hawaii. The amakihi avoids flowers it has <br>
<br>
recently visited, because the nectar will not be replenished for a certain period of time. <br>
<br>
But it must also not leave a revisit too late, or else some other bird will consume the nec-<br>
<br>
tar. It has to be sensitive to a certain magnitude of duration to return to the flower at the <br>
<br>
optimal interval. This seems to involve only a sensitivity to duration, not a representation <br>
<br>
of it as a duration. But this sensitivity can certainly be coordinated with a functioning <br>
<br>
perceptual representation of other matters. The creature that is sensitive to duration may <br>
<br>
have perceptual constancies for objective shape and shade, and representations of shape <br>
<br>
and shade may influence its actions. But adding a sensitivity to duration that is integrated <br>
<br>
with these spatial representational capacities in coordinated action is not enough to <br>
<br>
ground the claim that the organism representations temporal duration as temporal dur-<br>
<br>
ation. Saying that there is representation of duration simply on these grounds would <br>
<br>
make the notion of representation add nothing in the temporal case that is not already <br>
<br>
explained by temporal sensitivity to duration. . . . All that is necessary to explain the <br>
<br>
actions of the amakihi bird is that after the duration has elapsed, some system in the bird <br>
<br>
generates the means-end command ‘To obtain food, go to such-and-such location’. The <br>
<br>
time at which this means-end command appears in the bird’s systems is sensitive to the <br>
<br>
duration that has lapsed since the bird’s last visit to the flower. Duration does not enter <br>
<br>
into the content of the command. Nor does the past tense enter the content of the com-<br>
<br>
mand. The bird’s actions are entirely explained by the presence of that command whose <br>
<br>
content does not mention duration and is entirely in the present tense.291<br><br>
Of course, as emphasized in <i>Origins of Objectivity</i>, perceivers often have pre-perceptual <br>
sensing mechanisms that track time.292 The retinal flow that bees utilize in flight to <br>
 cor rel ate with time and distance does not make any use of the bees’ visual perception. <br>
The bird example does not, however, fit this mold. It does involve attribution of temporal <br>
relations.<br>
<br>
I think that the example has no force against my view. Peacocke does not explain why <br>
he thinks that the example is a counter-example. He takes it as obvious that the bird does <br>
not represent duration as duration. I think the claim anything but obvious.<br>
<br>
Peacocke’s example does not bear on my conditions of attribution of duration <i>in percep-<br>
tion</i>, because the case does not suggest that the bird represents duration <i>in perception</i>. But <br>
Peacocke intends his example to show that the bird does not represent duration at all. <br>
Although some perceptual states attribute duration (in tracking motion, for example), <br>
many perceptual-level attributions of duration occur in perceptual memory. Coordination <br>
of temporal sensitivity with perception via memory is probably the most salient type of <br>
coordination. Peacocke ignores the bird’s memory. A psychological account must take the <br><br>

<b>Cont FN</b>291 Peacocke, <i>The Primacy of Metaphysics</i>, 88–9. My answer to this example carries over, with minor adjust-<br>
ments, to two other examples that Peacocke gives—one about cyclic temporal representation, one about flashes.<br>
292 Burge, <i>Origins of Objectivity</i>, 503, 508, 521. Time is not perceived. Time lacks relevant causal power. <br>
However, my account of non-perceptual sensory registration allows that time be non-perceptually sensed. <br>
Sensing an instance of time requires that the sensory-state-type statistically and causally co-vary with instances <br>
of specific types of time-passage, and function to do so. Relevant sensory states do statistically and causally co-<br>
vary types of time passage inasmuch as events sequenced in time (a) cause aspects of or changes in the sensory <br>
states, (b) co-vary with those aspects or changes in sensory states and with associated types of time passage; and <br>
(c) function to do so. Our sensing time depends on sensing and being caused by temporally successive events, <br>
whose types co-vary with relevant types of sensory states.</div>
