80 perceptual constancy</div>
<br><br>
The state that results from sensory input and on the basis of which the motor command <br>
is issued combines a simple sum of torque stress in left-right directions and an even sim-<br>
pler summation of walking energy. Although the state is <i>functionally</i> explained partly in <br>
terms of its relation to space, it can be easily and naturally be explained <i>causally</i> in terms <br>
of computationally simple weightings of proximal stimulation from proprioception. Such <br>
weightings and such proprioception do not themselves concern environmental space at all.<br>
<br>
Of course, there is always a causal, non-representational, physiologically based ex plan-<br>
ation of every sensory and motor phenomenon, including those that also have representa-<br>
tional causal explanations. I conjecture that when non-representational explanations are <br>
simple and natural—as they are in the cases just described—science does not and should <br>
not invoke causal explanations that cite representational states. In these two cases, it cer-<br>
tainly does not invoke such explanations.<br>
<br>
In these cases, the under-determination problem in explaining relations between inner <br>
states and the environment is too easy to invite a new sort of causal explanation in terms <br>
of representational states with conditions for accuracy and inaccuracy. Functional ex plan-<br>
ation suffices to explain the environmental relevance of the sensory and motor states.<br>
<br>
As far as I can see, this is the path that science always follows. Causal explanations of <br>
simple path integration systems do not invoke representational states that set conditions <br>
for accuracy. The vector in environmental space is relevant to functional accounts. Only <br>
when path integration systems take perceptual input do they represent space and spatial <br>
attributes.<br><br>

<b>Very Simple Perceptual Color and Lightness Constancies<br><br>
</div>
</b>Most color and lightness constancies rely heavily on spatial cues. Yet color constancy can <br>
occur without spatial cues. Here I outline how such cases are possible. For the sake of <br>
simplicity, I assume that color is surface reflectance.<br>
<br>
Color constancy and lightness constancy are capacities that separate surface color or <br>
lightness from illumination, and thereby represent color or lightness. The separation <br>
(objectification) occurs despite significant differences in proximal stimulation deriving <br>
from differences in illumination. The separation depends on the early visual system’s re gis-<br>
ter ing a feature of the light, in the retinal image, that is constant across different il lu min-<br>
ations of perceived surfaces. (The <i>retinal image</i> is the array of light just as it strikes the <br>
retinal sensors. It is the primary proximal stimulus in vision.) Subjects are much better at <br>
visually determining surface reflectance than they are at determining illumination, sug-<br>
gesting that the visual system is more geared to representing reflectance than il lu min-<br>
ation.76 Since reflectances tend to be ecologically more important for perceivers, this point <br>
is antecedently plausible.<br>
<br>
Lightness constancy is the capacity to distinguish given degrees of lightness, on a scale <br>
from white through shades of grey to black, despite significant differences in proximal <br>
stimulation. The key differences in proximal stimulation derive from different il lu min-<br>
ations. A primary cue in proximal stimulation that remains constant across different <br><br>
