<b>Some Basics about Perceptual Systems<br><br>
</div>
</b>The field of our sensuous intuitions and sensations of which we are not con-<br>
<br>
scious, although we can at the same time undoubtedly conclude that we have <br>
<br>
them . . . in humans and so also in animals is immeasurable.<br>

Immanuel Kant, <i>Anthropology</i> (author’s translation)<br><br>
Part II concerns basic structural features, basic functions, the semantics, and some of the <br>
content of visual perception. I explain how the primary subsidiary representational func-<br>
tions, reference (or picking out) and attribution (or characterizing) contribute to a repre-<br>
sentational form and to perceptual states’ being accurate. I outline the spatio-temporal <br>
frameworks in which normal visual perception functions. I discuss the iconic format of <br>
visual perception.<br>
<br>
In this chapter, I make some basic points about perceptual systems. I discuss five mat-<br>
ters. The first is the relation between representational content and operations—or transi-<br>
tions, or transformations—in a perceptual system. The second is the nature of computation <br>
in a perceptual system. The third centers on general issues about order of processing of <br>
perceptual attributives, and how formation of some types of perceptual representation <br>
depends on formation of other types. The fourth is methodology for determining whether <br>
attribution of biological natural kinds like <i>dog</i> and chemical natural kinds like <i>iron</i>, and attri-<br>
bution of functional kinds like <i>knife</i> or <i>violin</i> occur in perceptual systems. The fifth is taxo-<br>
nomic hierarchies in perception—the fact that perceptual kinds, hence representational <br>
contents, come at various levels of abstraction.<br>
<br>
Discussion of the first three matters is directed mainly to philosophers just coming to <br>
the study of perception. The conclusions of these discussions are assumed by nearly all <br>
mainstream perceptual psychologists. However, in some cases, understanding bases for <br>
the conclusions may deepen understanding. The fourth and fifth matters are little dis-<br>
cussed by either philosophers or perceptual psychologists, and may be of interest to both.<br><br>

<b>Principles Governing Transitions Contrasted with <br>

Representational Contents<br><br>
</div>
</b>It is crucial to distinguish a principle governing a transformation among perceptual states <br>
(or between a non-perceptual state and a perceptual state) from the representational <br>
 content of perceptual state or event. The two are easily mixed up. Both the state and the <br>
transition have a content. The state instantiates a representational kind. The trans form-<br>
ation is a law-like pattern specified by a law-like psychological principle. Both trans-<br>
form ation principles and the perceptual (or non-perceptual registrational) states that they <br>
govern can be determined only by theory, not by introspection. The representational </div>
