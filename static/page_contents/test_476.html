476 Primitive Attribution of Causation, Agency</div>
<br><br>
simple pursuit requires anticipating the distinctive abilities of the prey: abilities to run at <br>
different speeds, jump certain gaps, use paths that are dangerous for the hunter, and so on. <br>
Anticipation of efficiency is aided if the hunter or prey can anticipate what is in the sen-<br>
sory range of the antagonist.<br>
<br>
Such anticipation is clearly present in cooperative hunters: wild dogs, hyenas, some of <br>
the great cats, a few birds, and many primates—preeminently chimpanzees and humans.639 <br>
A common strategy is for some hunters to force prey toward other hunters.<br>
<br>
Chimpanzees use a sophisticated version of this strategy. They hunt for monkeys in <br>
trees. The monkeys are faster and can get higher on smaller branches, because they weigh <br>
less. Success in hunting rarely derives from surprise or direct-line attack. Typically, one <br>
chimpanzee chases some monkeys, while other chimpanzees, having surveyed most likely <br>
escape routes, anticipate direction of flight. They then climb other trees waiting for the <br>
fleeing monkeys. Usually, the chimpanzees that anticipate the directions of flight cannot <br>
see the monkeys as the monkeys move among the trees. So they must anticipate and <br>
remember the most likely, most efficient flight routes. Learning to be a hunter that antici-<br>
pates monkey-flight normally takes many years.640<br>
<br>
Representing agents, their acts, and the targets of the acts in predation and other phys-<br>
ic al conflicts places a premium on accurate representation of the acts’ spatial features. <br>
Representing such agency is inevitably connected not only with <i>locating</i> it, but with <br>
 perceptually tracking and perceptually anticipating most likely, most efficient, <i>paths</i> to a <br>
target. Possibly, a large component of the skill derives from general learning, held in mem-<br>
ory. Some components—perceptual memory, perceptual anticipation, perceptual learning— <br>
are, I think, at the representational level of perception, if agency representation is prod-<br>
uced by chimpanzees’ visual systems.<br>
<br>
Another common class of represented targets comprise sharing food. A target may be <br>
to give the food to some recipient. An observer could perceptually anticipate the event of <br>
giving. Such anticipation would assign roles to the entities that figure in reaching the tar-<br>
get. Not only the agent and act are anticipated. The food is an anticipated object or <i>theme</i> <br>
of the act, and the recipient is an anticipated <i>beneficiary</i>. Siblings attend carefully to whom <br>
is being fed by a parent. When a sibling receives food, the observing animal often lobbies <br>
for more for itself. In social animals, an initial rationing by a parent is commonly altered <br>
through systematic, prolonged attempts by offspring to try for more food than their initial <br>
allotment.641 Here the structure of action attribution includes relations of acts to themes <br><br>

takes a chimpanzee about twenty years. The learning could consist in adaptive tuning of perceptual and <br>
perception-anticipation mechanisms. Similar, though less spectacular, capacities for mapping a target of another <br>
individual’s activity, and for anticipating routes to the target, are necessary for competitive mating and intra-<br>
species fighting—both coalitional fights and individual fights—at least where fights involve foresight beyond <br>
assessing relative size or vigor of an opponent.<br>

occurs in lions, hyenas, birds, and killer whales. Grooming is another area in which primitive representation of <br>
benefactives of agency is likely.</div>
