602 Perceptual Memory: Short-Term Systems</div>

identification is faster and more accurate. Targets can be detected and recalled if pictures <br>
are presented at rates of 20 pictures a second (50 ms a picture), perhaps faster. Here again, <br>
there is access to an antecedent structure that perception fits into.927 Where the perception <br>
of an antecedent cueing target is of a word, the linguistic processing connects the percep-<br>
tion of word shape to concepts and propositional structures, before the sequence of <br>
 pictures is presented.<br>
<br>
There seem to be parallel, but different, types of processing in formation of memories in <br>
CSTM. There is processing for scenes and processing for words and numerals. It is likely <br>
that formation of visual memories (or other ordinary perceptual memories) and forma-<br>
tion of memories from perception of linguistic items proceed in different channels, with <br>
similar characteristics. The same parallel nature appears to occur in working memory. <br>
Various dissociation results suggest that certain types of interference affect visual memory <br>
and not verbal memory, or vice-versa.928<br>
<br>
However, the different processes for words and scenes interact. Potter’s use of words as <br>
antecedent cueing-primes in retention of a sequence of pictures provides some insight <br>
into relations between the two visual perceptual systems. CSTM, or possibly a relation <br>
between CSTM and a word-retention analog, figures in these relations between the two <br>
visual perceptual systems, or sub-systems—the one for words and verbally expressed con-<br>
cepts and the one for scenes. Words express concepts—ability general representations that <br>
function to contribute to a propositional structure. CSTM is a locus of interaction between <br>
concepts and perceptual attributives.<br>
<br>
CSTM differs from visual sensory memory in not being canceled by masking. Normally, <br>
CSTM retains representations much longer than the 200–300 ms duration of visual sen-<br>
sory memory—roughly 8 seconds, deteriorating during the latter seconds. CSTM seems to <br>
differ from visual working memory and FVSTM in that it has a much greater storage <br>
capacity. It can retain, under certain conditions, information about twenty briefly pre-<br>
sented pictures.<br>
<br>
Like visual working memory, CSTM can activate long-term memory. Conversely, as the <br>
effect of the antecedent primes presented before RSVP suggests, CSTM is affected by rep-<br>
resentations in long-term memory. Like visual working memory, CSTM retains cat egor-<br>
iza tions from both perception and supra-perceptual representation.<br>
<br>
An overview of the operation of CSTM use is as follows. Presentation of a sequence of <br>
stimuli from pictures produces fast perceptual attributions to pictured entities. These <br>
attributions are stored in CSTM and associated unconsciously with any attributions in <br>
longer-term memory that are relevant to the newly perceived and CSTM-remembered <br>
subject matter. These attributions and attributive structures are useable outside the lab in <br>
several ways, depending on the subject’s current targets. For example, if the subject is try-<br>
ing to locate and identify a target in a search, only a subset of the initial attributions may <br>
be selected and retained. Any attributions that are not incorporated into such a structure <br><br>
