 (2) if the attributive’s indicated attribute-type is not instantiated by the particular <br>
<br>
(or for a relational attributive, particulars) to which it is cross-attribute attributed; <br>
<br>
[suppose that the attributive is cubical; and cubical makes an attribution of <i>cubical</i> <br>
<br>
to a perceived body that is not cubical];<br><br>
or (inclusive)<br><br>
 (3) if a referential application does not pick out a perceived particular to which the <br>
<br>
indicated attribute-type is cross-attribute attributed; [suppose that one has a refer-<br>
<br>
ential illusion as of a body and one attributes <i>cubical</i> in a way that functions to <br>
<br>
characterize the purported body].<br><br>
<i>Cross-attribute attribution</i> of an attribute-<i>instance</i> fails:<br><br>
 (1) if the relevant attributive does not indicate an attribute-type (the Escher-type case); <br>
<br>
[this case entails that no instance of the purported attribute-type is perceived, or <br>
<br>
referred to; hence no attribute-instance or attribute-type is attributed by the rele-<br>
<br>
vant attributive, even though the attributive functions on an occasion of attributive <br>
<br>
application to make an attribution];<br>
<br>
 (2) if the relevant attributive indicates an attribute-type, but no instance of the type is <br>
<br>
perceived, or referred to; [suppose that one has an illusion of a body and of a <br>
<br>
generic, outer-boundary-connected shape; suppose that one’s perceptual state <br>
<br>
functions to attribute the type <i>cubical</i> and a (purported) instance of <i>cubical</i> to the <br>
<br>
(purported) body];182<br>
<br>
 (3) if the relevant attributive indicates an attribute-type and the attributive is referen-<br>
<br>
tially applied to a perceived particular, but the particular is not an instance of the <br>
<br>
attribute that the attributive indicates—the intra-attribute attribution fails; <br>
<br>
 [suppose that one mistakes an instance of <i>cylindrical</i> for an instance of <i>cubical</i> as <br>
<br>
one sees a body as cubical; in this case, although the perceived attribute instance—<br>
<br>
the instance of <i>cylindrical</i>—is in the perceived body, the type <i>cubical</i> that is attrib-<br>
<br>
uted to the body is not a property of the body];<br>
<br>
 (4) if the relevant attributive betokens a particular and cross-attributes both the par-<br>
<br>
ticular and the type that the particular instantiates, to a further referred-to particu-<br>
<br>
lar; but the betokened instance is not instantiated in the further particular to which <br>
<br>
it is attributed; [this case is easier to illustrate for colors than for shapes, though I <br>
<br>
think it possible for shapes; suppose that one accurately perceives an instance of <br>
<br>
<i>brown</i> as instantiating brownness and one perceives a body, but one mistakenly <br>
<br>
attributes the seen instance of brownness to the seen body];<br><br>
or (inclusive)<br><br>

<b>FOOTNOTES</b><br>
<b>Cont FN</b>182 Clearly this sort of perception goes wrong in more than one way. One cannot perceive a body while failing <br>
to perceive any instance of any shape that is perceived as the shape of the body. One could have an illusion of <br>
texture, a shape on the surface of the body (so that there is no instance of texture seen at all), while one still per-<br>
ceives a body. Then a state that functions to make a cross-attribute attribution of an instance of texture to the <br>
body would fail, because of the failure to pick out a texture-instance to attribute to the body.</div>
