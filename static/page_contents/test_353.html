of such entities make up <i>Big Surface</i>, and are mapped by parts of the map-like representa-<br>
tional content.<br>
<br>
As indicated earlier, many geometric relations are not preserved between the geometric <br>
structure of the perceptual representational content and the spatial structure of <i>Big <br>
Surface</i>. The relation <i>distance apart</i> is not preserved. A representation of an edge of a sur-<br>
face may border a representation of a background in the iconic perceptual representa-<br>
tional content. An edge of a seen surface in the environment may <i>be</i>, and <i>be represented as</i>, <br>
very far in front of the seen part of the background. Still, in the iconic structure of the <br>
representational content and representation, the edge representation borders the back-<br>
ground representation. These bordering representations map (non-representationally, <br>
naturally) to bordering surface areas that occupy <i>Big Surface</i>.<br>
<br>
On the other hand, visually perceived occupants of parts of <i>Big Surface</i> that are in fact <br>
close to one another in the physical environment are close to one another in the iconic <br>
perceptual representation. As just mentioned, the converse does not hold.<b>Figure 9.3 </b>Depiction of a scene showing different points of view.<div id="PGHEADER">
