Richer Perceptual Categorization and Its Processing 497</div>

surfaces and bodies grouped by shape, size, and motion. The shapes, sizes, and motions <br>
may correspond to those of pigs, books, kitchens, readings. These scene-gist perceptual <br>
representations are automatically compared with scene-gist representations from memory. <br>
The results are compared with stored, typical perceptual categorizations. Comparisons of <br>
perceptual and memory scene-gist representations are then fed back to the initial sketch-<br>
like perceptual categorizations, supported in IT.661 Interaction between scene-gist areas, <br>
on one hand, and the central ventral categorization area, IT, and face-representation areas, <br>
on the other, is substantial. By 150 ms, signals from scene-gist areas begin to refine initial <br>
IT cat egor iza tion. The feedback adjusts and fills out the initial sketch-like perceptual <br>
 cat egor iza tions supported in IT. Association of a difficult-to-categorize, or generically <br>
 cat egor ized, object with scene-gist often improves accuracy and enhances specificity.<br>
<br>
Are such context-effects on categorization instances of cognition, in a sense in which <br>
cognition intrudes on perceptual processing from supra-perceptual-level capacities out-<br>
side it? Not in themselves. The first perceptual categorization, the first perceptual scene-<br>
gist representations, the association of these scene-gist representations with memories of <br>
past scene-gist perceptual representation, the memories of typical categorizations, and the <br>
feedback of the results from these memory sources to enhance initial perceptual cat egor-<br>
iza tion involve only iconic perceptual attributives. The processing involves no operations <br>
more advanced than those in processing among perceptual states. I substantiate this point <br>
shortly. But first a word about the physiology.<br>
<br>
Some of the processing goes through a pre-frontal area (the orbital frontal cortex) that <br>
seems to support storage of probabilities of associations between memories of types of <br>
perceptual categories and memories of perceptual scene-gist representations. Memory of <br>
perceptions of scene types is also supported in the medial temporal areas, including the <br>
para-hippocampal cortex. Of course, the fact that prefrontal areas also support clearly cog-<br>
nitive operations—say, in propositional thought—does not imply that all contributions by <br>
prefrontal areas are cognitive. There is no evidence that propositional operations figure in <br>
these fast, low-level associations and comparisons that figure in computational patterns <br>
that yield enhanced perceptual categorization.<br>
<br>
One must focus here on computational models of perceptual processing, not on <br>
brain areas.<br>
<br>
Psychophysical models assume that the stored representations have the attributional <br>
content and format of perceptual representations—sketch-like representation. Such <br>
 models never invoke propositional structure or inferences. So there is reason to think that <br>
these influences from gist memory and memory of categorization are perceptual-level. All <br>
categorizational capacities and perceptual memories discussed here are typed in terms of <br>
<i>perceptual</i> attributives.<br>
<br>
The point that this processing is perceptual-level is also supported by considering the <br>
operations involved. The key operations are retention, learning by association, storage of <br><br>
