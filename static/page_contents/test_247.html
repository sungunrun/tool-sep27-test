Accuracy Conditions for Attributives in Constancies 247</div>
<br><br>
Color constancy breaks down when there are insufficient cues. Compatibly with both <br>
alternatives in the previous paragraph, it probably breaks down at great distances. In any <br>
case, the distortions produced by atmospheric effects are capitalized upon by the human <br>
visual system to estimate either ordinal depth or distance more accurately than when the <br>
distortions are absent.230<br>
<br>
Let us return to the drawings. They motivated the excursus into whether conditions that <br>
are not represented (indicated/attributed) by perceptual attributives can affect a percep-<br>
tual state’s accuracy. It seems clear that the second of the three drawings is less accurate <br>
than the first and third. I think that this point holds <i>whether or not there are perceptual <br>
attributives for illumination</i>. We <i>think</i> of the drawings as functioning to represent not only <br>
the surface color and lightness but also the illumination (and by analogy, the atmospheric <br>
effects). We also think of the drawings as representing the phenomenological look of the <br>
surface. Drawings can do that because we have <i>concepts</i> for illumination, atmospheric <br>
effects, and phenomenological looks. We can <i>take</i> the task to include drawing the il lu min-<br>
ation. Similarly, for atmospheric effects and phenomenological looks. Then the partly con-<br>
ceptual content of the drawing must get those features right. Perceptual states may not <br>
represent illumination. They certainly do not represent phenomenological looks (features <br>
of the states themselves) or atmospheric effects as such. If a perceptual state does not rep-<br>
resent an attribute, it cannot be non-veridical because of its relation to the attribute.<br>
<br>
To summarize the discussion of the three drawings: The case raised a temptation to think <br>
that the veridicality conditions for perception go beyond what is perceptually represented. <br>
The subsequent discussion is meant to resist the temptation. One can count the second <br>
<i>drawing</i> non-veridical because its veridicality conditions are set by the artist’s intentions. <br>
The intentions include concepts for illumination, atmospheric effects, and the phenomeno-<br>
logical look of the surface. The second drawing fails to represent these conceptually repre-<br>
sented properties correctly. Perception does not have attributives that indicate atmospheric <br>
effects or phenomenological look. It may lack illumination attributives. Illumination effects <br>
and atmospheric effects normally show up in the natures of perceptual attributives—their <br>
modes of presentation. Phenomenological look is an aspect of perceptual attributives. These <br>
properties, with the possible exception of illumination, are not represented in perception. A <br>
perceptual state’s not using a cue, or not involving a standard mode of presentation, in <br>
response to a stimulus does not in itself make the state in accur ate. It can get environmental <br>
properties right by other cues. It is accurate if it uses sufficient cues to represent correctly <br>
the particulars and attributes that it functions representationally to represent.<br>
<br>
I conclude that the accuracy conditions stated for perceptual states need not be revised. <br>
Perceptual states function to represent a limited number of attributes, using a large num-<br>
ber of cues from sensory information registration. Perceptual states cannot be inaccurate <br>
unless they fail to pick out particulars or fail to characterize them correctly, using at tribu-<br>
tives that the states apply.231<br><br>

<b>Cont FN</b>230 Another cue for depth estimation that derives from atmospheric effects is increasing blur in representation <br>
of edges and textual aspects as objects are more distant. I leave it to others to determine how such cues figure in <br>
the nature of perceptual attributives and accuracy conditions for them. Blur differs from atmospheric effects in <br>
not being a property of the scene. It is deficiency of acuity in the visual system.<br>
