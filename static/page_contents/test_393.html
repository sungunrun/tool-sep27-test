the picture was in a rapid sequence of pictures involving “meaningful” visual objects, con-<br>
scious recognition was poor, on the order of 11% of the time.447<br>
<br>
Two types of backward masking interference were identified. A “meaningless” collage of <br>
colored shapes can interfere with perceptual identification if it is presented immediately <br>
after very short, under-100 ms exposures. A “meaningful” picture interferes with concept-<br>
mediated recognition, if it occurs any time less than 500 ms in a sequence of pictures after <br>
a target picture. The “meaningless” mask does not, however, interfere with either identifica-<br>
tion or recognition tasks if presented 100 ms after target picture is presented.<br>
<br>
Potter concluded that detection or identification proceeds very rapidly—in approximately <br>
100–200 ms, even if a target is not anticipated. Once an entity is perceptually identified, it <br>
can be compared very rapidly, for recognition, to a target description or target picture in <br>
memory. Comparisons and recognitions after a <i>word</i> (‘boat’) was presented clearly involved <br>
conceptual memory. If such a word is presented in advance, recognition was almost as accurate <br>
and fast as comparisons and recognitions after a picture is presented in advance—just <br>
slightly slower. See Figure 10.1 for illustration of Potter’s experimental paradigm.<br>
<br>
Potter also concluded that individuals cannot reliably retain an initial rapid identification <br>
without additional time (approximately 400 ms) for processing. During this time, an iden-<br>
tification is vulnerable to conceptual masking from a “meaningful” picture that follows the <br>
first picture. If a mask that requires comparably high-level processing occurs during this <br>
time frame, recognition fails. If a “meaningless” mask occurs during this time frame, rec-<br>
ognition still tends to succeed. Potter postulated a short-term conceptual mem ory that <br>
functions to retain a conceptual identification for this period of time and that is vulnerable <br>
to interference during this time. I return to this type of memory in Chapter 16, the section <br>
Conceptual Short-Term Memory.448<br>

This early line of experimentation suggested a possible conflict with the classical <br>
Treisman account. If identifications and spatial localizations of categorically identified <br><br>
