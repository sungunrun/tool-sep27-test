I call the most generic level of visual objects (comprised of the categories <i>generic body</i>, <br>
<i>generic</i> <i>surface</i>, and <i>generic edge</i>) the ‘<i>super-super-ordinate</i> level’. There are corresponding <br>
super-super-ordinate, or maximally generic, perceptual attributives. Recall that ‘body’ is <br>
used here to apply to entities with generic shape, a relatively closed or continuous outer <br>
spatial boundary, that maintain some stability and are relatively rigid. (For understanding <br>
these points, see note 296.) Objects, including surfaces and bodies, are segmented and <br>
categorized by about 60–80 ms. Motions of objects are segmented at similar speeds. The <br>
first <i>specific</i> categorizations in human visual systems seem to be categorizations of reptile-<br>
bodies or reptile-surfaces at about 70 ms and faces at 80 ms.541<br>
<br>
I call the level of perceptual categorization of <i>face</i>, <i>animal-body</i> (or <i>animal-surface</i>), <br>
<i>animal-part-body</i> (or -<i>surface</i>), the ‘<i>super-ordinate</i>’ level.<br>
<br>
Perceptual categorization of <i>impala-body</i>, <i>dog-body</i>, <i>reptile-body</i>, <i>human-body</i>, <i>human-<br>
face</i>, <i>human-hand-body-part</i>—all categorized by relatively specific shapes (such as <i>impala-<br>
shape</i>) occurs at the ‘<i>basic</i> level’. Eleanor Rosch isolated this level as the fastest and most <br>
commonly used, when individuals were asked to <i>judge</i> cases. If one is asked what <i>that</i> <br>
clearly visible thing is, one is more likely to say ‘dog’ than ‘terrier’ or ‘animal’. Rosch <br>
showed the basic level to have the largest number of linguistically specifiable features, <br>
compared to higher or lower categorization levels.542<br>
<br>
Perceptual categorization of <i>beagle-body</i> and <i>terrier-body</i> is at the ‘<i>subordinate</i> level’. <br>
Expertise and long-term perceptual memory that retains past perceptions tend to speed <br>
categorization of subordinate categories and make it more accurate.<br>
<br>
I call perceptual categorization based on discriminations between different instances of <br>
subordinate categories, like differently shaped poodle-shaped poodle-bodies, <i>by more fine-<br>
grained attributives</i>, ‘<i>recognition-level</i> categorization’. This level includes responses specific <br>
enough that they might apply to only one entity (perhaps like <i>mama-body</i> or <i>mama-face</i>).<br>
<br>
There is no armchair-determinable limit on how specific a categorical attributive can <br>
be. Limits are set by a perceiver’s powers for discrimination—for example, shape, texture, <br>
or color discrimination—and for retaining discriminations in at least a temporary compe-<br>
tence. Since perceptually indiscriminable duplicates are always possible, recognition and <br>
“individuation” of particulars in perception always depend on contextual perceptual refer-<br>
ential applications, as well as whatever attributives are used. The point is that there is a <br>
level of perceptual categorization that is specific enough to loom large in the recognition <br>
of familiar particulars.<br>
<br>
I distinguish all levels of categorization from <i>object recognition</i>. Object recognition <br>
involves categorization, but consists in perceiving a <i>particular</i> either tracked from a previ-<br>
ous memory of it, or sensed as familiar, where the familiarity in fact derives from a <br>
 previous perceptual encounter, but without using activation of memory of that particular. <br>
The categorization is detailed enough to distinguish a particular entity from some other <br>
en tities of the same kind. For example, to recognize a particular terrier-body, one would <br>
have to associate the categorization either with a sense of familiarity, which need not <br><br>
