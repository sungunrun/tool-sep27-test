Visual Working Memory 597</div>
<br><br>
VWM functions in motor control, for example, in reaching for objects. Guidance of <br>
hand movement and forming the hand to grasp an object relies not only on concurrent <br>
vision, but also on visual working memory.902 (See Chapter 14.)<br>
<br>
A further function of working memory is to retain perceptual representation or im agin-<br>
ation of objects while they are manipulated by other types of input—prominently, the ex ecu-<br>
tive control system and attentional operations associated with it. An example of working <br>
memory’s forming a base for operations by further systems is the famous case of conscious <br>
mental rotation. An individual holds visually represented objects in working memory, while <br>
the shape of an oddly oriented object is determined in visual imagination.903<br>
<br>
A classic function of attention, closely associated with working memory, is maintenance <br>
and renewal of working memory’s contents. Voluntary rehearsal can produce renewal. But <br>
renewal can also derive from more automatic factors. Task-relevant items from long-term <br>
memory or from more recently acquired search targets can trigger renewal.904<br>
<br>
In auditory and visual forms, working memory figures in tasks like reversing per cep-<br>
tual ly given numerals or letters. Propositional reasoning can also use conceptualized con-<br>
tents in visual (non-linguistic) memory. It is nearly certain that conscious perceptual <br>
beliefs about ordinary, non-symbolic entities are retained in working memory.<br>
<br>
Working memory also functions in the conscious retrieval of contents from long-term <br>
memory. Such retrieval reduces need to actively maintain contents of working memory.905<br>
<br>
I conclude this section by returning to interactions between WM and other systems.<br>
<br>
Contents of perceptual working memory can affect allocation of attentional re sources.906 <br>
This function is one of its most basic ones. It is closely associated with working memory’s <br>
role in visual search. The effect of contents of working memory can even influence rapid, <br>
reflexive eye movement. In a revealing experiment, saccades shifted to an abruptly appear-<br>
ing target whose color matched or failed to match a concurrent VWM representation. The <br>
target was the only stimulus in the display. Saccades were faster and closer to the position <br>
of the target when the target matched the color represented in concurrent VWM. So the <br>
effects of VWM show up very early in the operations of the oculomotor system.907<br>
<br>
Contents of working memory can affect processing of perceptual information. For ex ample, <br>
perceptual contents retained in VWM can bias the processing of representation of motion <br>
and orientation, under certain conditions, after first-formed perception occurs. It can also <br>
affect perceptual categorizations, at stages after the first formation of categorizations.908<br><br>
