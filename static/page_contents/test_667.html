Uses and Misuses of the Term ‘Cognition’ 667</div>
<br><br>
Feedback from one visual area to another cannot reasonably count as cognitive, just by <br>
virtue of being feedback. For example, feedback from temporal visual areas to early visual <br>
areas, such as V1, figures in surface segregation and figure–ground segregation. This is <br>
recurrent processing <i>within</i>  the visual system, not processing penetrating the visual sys-<br>
tem from outside it.1089 I recommend either defining a clear “top” to a processing hierarchy <br>
or, better, dropping the term ‘top-down’ altogether. ‘Feedback’ can replace it in most <br>
instances.<br>
<br>
A deeper drawback of identifying cognition with “top-down” processing is that doing <br>
so frequently carries unwarranted assumptions about psychological operations that vari-<br>
ous areas of the brain <i>exclusively</i> support. It is often assumed, without argument, that if <br>
feedback into a perceptual-state-forming process comes from the prefrontal cortex, the <br>
feedback is cognitive.1090<br>
<br>
Input from the frontal eye fields (FEF), located in the pre-frontal cortex, underlies <br>
much endogenous visual attention. Feed-forward impulses from FEF to MT/V5 or V4 <br>
affects processing perceptual states and their representational contents at relatively early <br>
stages. (See Chapter 15, the section Perceptual-Level Attention Commands <br>
and Guidance of Saccades.) Endogenous attention initiation supported in parietal <br>
areas supplements processing later. Attention produces more precise representation. Less <br>
attended representation represents some attributes more grossly or not at all. So the mode <br>
of presentation, hence representational contents of states that differ in these ways, are dif-<br>
ferent. Some authors infer directly from such facts that the top-down attention initiations <br>
or commands are cognitive.<br>
<br>
Content and format-structure of these attention commands are perceptual-level. They <br>
are borrowed from perception itself and are part of the visual system. Computational <br>
accounts include them and make no use of the special functions of concepts—attributives <br>
capable of functioning so as not to guide referential applications and to occur in prop os-<br>
ition al structure. Of course, supra-perceptual-level <i>antecedent</i>—antecedent beliefs and <br>
intentions—can cause the perceptual-level attention commands. These higher-level ante-<br>
cedents appear to be <i>computationally</i> dispensable. Computational accounts leave them <br>
out. The accounts remain perceptual-level.<br>
<br>
When beliefs and propositional-level intentions are causal antecedents of endogenous <br>
attention commands, the attention initiations or commands are often termed ‘cognitively <br>
driven’. I have no objection to this terminology. I return to cognitive causal antecedents to <br>
endogenous attention commands in the section The Cognitive Penetration <br>
Controversy, below. The present point is that nothing has shown either the immediate <br>
initiations of endogenous attention (the representational commands that immediately <br>
direct attention to environmental areas, features, or objects) or the attentional effects of <br>
those initiations in visual processing to be supra-perceptual.<br>
<br>
FEF supports eye movements and functions to enhance the precision of vision. This fact <br>
by itself should caution against assuming that a pre-frontal origin spells a cognitive origin. <br><br>
