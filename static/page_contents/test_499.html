essential to an explanation of the enrichment of perceptual categorization after 150 ms. <br>
Second, they do not figure in <i>computational</i> explanations of the perceptual processing. <br>
(For further discussion of these issues, see Chapter 16, the section Conceptual <br>
Short-Term Memory.)<br>
<br>
I also do not deny that there are conceptual representations of congruities and incon-<br>
gruities. We know that zebras do not read books and that pigs do not often enter kitchens. <br>
My view is that psychophysical explanations of the effect of gist memories on perceptual <br>
processing do not invoke, indispensably, conceptual understanding of incongruity. The <br>
explanations work with perceptual-level counterparts that indicate bodies, surfaces, <br>
shapes, and sizes, supplemented perhaps with some functional attributives. When compu-<br>
tational accounts of this processing that enhances initial perceptual categorization become <br>
rigorous, they will, I believe, remain at the perceptual level. (For further discussion, again <br>
see Chapter 16, the section Conceptual Short-Term Memory.)<br>
<br>
I turn to a second type of enhancement of initial at-a-glance perceptual categorization <br>
via feedback. This is enhancement from <i>stored</i> effects, from antecedent perception, of <br>
similar instances of categories, of spatial (shape/size) features on which the categorizations <br>
are based, or of diagnostic object-parts, that are cues to categorization. These enhance-<br>
ment cues help produce more specific (basic-level and subordinate-level) categorizations, <br>
especially in the context of occlusions and scene clutter, or crowding. The feedback is from <br>
pre-frontal and parietal areas to IT. It mainly occurs after 150 ms from stimulus onset.663<br>
<br>
After initial signals from the retinae reach IT, they are fed forward to areas in the pre-<br>
frontal cortex (PFC). Then comparisons of these types of stored cue representations are <br>
fed back to IT to enable more specific and more accurate categorizations.<br>
<br>
Shape representations, along with the initial super-ordinate categorizations (animal-<br>
body, face, reptile-body) that they support, are fed forward to PFC. These representations <br>
are compared with stored cues. The visual system uses such cues to make initial perceptual <br>
categorizations more specific. Supplementation that the cues provide is often necessary, if <br>
more specific categorization is to be achieved, especially in cluttered natural scenes, rife <br>
with distractors. Objects of categorization are often partly occluded. A perceiver must cat-<br>
egorize on the basis of a shape and size representation that may not match the object’s <br>
whole shape and size at all.<br>
<br>
Leading conjectures about how this problem is solved postulate a combination of two <br>
types of cues. One is a stored template or exemplar—innate or learned—of a whole. For <br>
example, there may be stored iconic representations of commonly met animal-shape sub-<br>
types: bird-shape, primate-shape, and so on.664 There are also more specific learned tem-<br>
plates: robin-shape, hawk-shape, sparrow-shape, chimp-shape, monkey-shape. <br>
Comparison of templates with incoming super-ordinate shape representations follow <br>
principles for (automatically and unconsciously) assessing similarity, according to some <br>
criterion. The results are fed back to IT. Some of these templates are grounded in the per-<br>
irhinal cortex, an area of the temporal lobe. They interact with higher ventral areas, such as <br>
IT, with great specificity in later (150–300 ms) visual processing.665 Of course, IT also <br><br>
