464 Primitive Attribution of Causation, Agency</div>
<br><br>
the authors’ argument that primitive representation of causation is perceptual lacks force <br>
as it stands.<br>
<br>
The authors cite lack of adaptation with regard to slip events that were matched to colli-<br>
sion events in low-level visual signals as counting against the percolation possibility. <br>
I believe that they are mistaken. I think that the mistake probably derives from their not <br>
distinguishing the grouping of spatio-temporal-motion attributions that trigger attribu-<br>
tion of causation from the attribution of causation itself. The attributions are different. <br>
One could accurately observe exactly the patterns that trigger attribution of causation, and <br>
one could group them perceptually as instances of a spatio-temporal-motion kind, and be <br>
mistaken, in any given case, in representing them as patterns in which the first event <br>
caused the second event.605 Bodies moving in each of the relevant ways could be manipu-<br>
lated from behind by unseen causes.<br>
<br>
For example, on some occasions, just as the moving body is contiguous with the body <br>
that then moves, the first body could be stopped and the second body could be moved, <br>
each by independent unobserved causes. The point generalizes to any specific movement <br>
pattern that triggers representation of causation. In such cases, perceptual attribution of <br>
the spatio-temporal-movement pattern would be accurate, but attribution of causation <br>
between the first body’s movement and the second body’s movement would be inaccurate. <br>
So the attribution of causation is a different attribution from the attribution of the spatio-<br>
temporal-motion patterns that normally signal it and normally trigger it.<br>
<br>
Since they are different, they mark different psychological capacities. Early representa-<br>
tion of causation depends on perceptual grouping of relevant spatio-temporal-motion <br>
events. Even as perceptually grouped, however, attribution of those events is not the same <br>
as attribution of causation. They have different veridicality conditions.<br>
<br>
What further psychological capacities are involved in attribution of causation? <br>
Anticipation of asymmetrical roles is one such capacity. The issue is whether such antici-<br>
pation is perceptual or supra-perceptual. I think it likely that such anticipatory capacities <br>
are coded at the perceptual level. The issue has not been developed, or well addressed, in <br>
the science. The issue needs exploration.<br>
<br>
The issue should be pursued in a way parallel to the way in which the issue over body <br>
representation was pursued in the science. Representation of body is distinguished from <br>
representation of of an entity as having or being a connected outer boundary. <br>
Representation of body is distinguished from those types of representation by perceptual <br>
anticipations of generic shape continuity over time, including having an integrity, perhaps <br>
solidity or relative rigidity, that sand piles and clouds do not have. These anticipations are <br>
easily assimilated. Anticipation of an asymmetry of roles is plausibly, but less obviously, <br>
perceptual.<br>
<br>
Let us return to the authors’ claim that lack of adaptation with regard to slip events that <br>
were matched to collision events in low-level visual signals shows that attribution of caus-<br>
ation is itself perceptual. I think that lack of adaptation of slip events shows only that the <br>
perceptual system groups certain spatio-temporal-motion patterns that in fact normally <br>
coincide with causation in a way that contrasts with a perceptual grouping of slip events. <br>
Perhaps slip events are not grouped into some more generic type at all. Given that the <br><br>
