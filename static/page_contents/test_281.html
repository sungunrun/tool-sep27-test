signals the presence of a nutrient absorbed through the orifice. The organism’s environ-<br>
<br>
ment is such—let’s stipulate—that normally the nutrient is present for at least 5 seconds <br>
<br>
after its associated color is perceivable and in an amount beyond that required for sa ti-<br>
<br>
ation; and the organism is such that satiation is reached in 2 seconds (so, normally before <br>
<br>
the nutrient is no longer present). Now, suppose the time course from perception to use <br>
<br>
to the beginning of absorption is 100 ms. In this case, no explanatory purpose is served <br>
<br>
by assigning temporal representational content. The time-course of the organism’s states, <br>
<br>
together with the rate of relevant environmental change, suffices to explain the use of the <br>
<br>
organism’s perceptual states and their ethological function. No explanatory power is <br>
<br>
added by, for instance, including now in the perception’s representational content and <br>
<br>
having it change to then or very recently during the time lag from perception to use. <br>
<br>
Given the environmental facts, it suffices to explain ethological success that normally it is <br>
<br>
the present color that the organism perceives and that its use does occur very soon after.283<br><br>
The example shows serious reflection. It has initial appeal. Invoking memory to explain <br>
the creature’s psychology can seem heavy-handed. For intuitive psychology, the example is <br>
forceful. It does less well given the aims and practice of psychological science.<br>
<br>
I begin with some facts about relevant scientific explanations. It is natural for intuitive <br>
psychology to take longer-term types of memory as paradigmatic. Many of the short-term <br>
types of memory, especially unconscious types, do not figure in our personal experience. <br>
(See Chapters 16–17.) Gross’s citing a very short time course of 100 ms, from perception <br>
to use to effect of use, naturally suggests, and was designed to suggest, that postulating <br>
memory provides no explanatory value.284 But memories that span much shorter time <br>
intervals are postulated and studied in vision science. Human eyes shift direction in sac-<br>
cades about 3 times a second. Each shift produces a different perspective on the world and <br>
a different perceptual state with a different content. During an eye shift, or saccade, indi-<br>
viduals are blind. Saccades last from 10–50 ms. The science studies what is retained from <br>
pre-saccade perception to post-saccade perception. What is retained, unconsciously, from <br>
the first perception affects how the second perception is formed, as it is being formed. The <br>
retention is called <i>trans-saccadic memory</i>. (See Chapter 16, the section Trans-Saccadic <br>
Memory.) So there are actual memories that span 10 ms. When a perceptual state is <br>
replaced by another and something of the first perceptual state is retained, there is mem-<br>
ory. Psychological science studies the psychological principles of the retention. How much <br>
and what is retained? How long is it retained? What does the memory cause? By what <br>
principles?<br>
<br>
Perceptual memory is retention of representational content past the time when the per-<br>
ceptual state (or a temporal stage of the perceptual state) from which the memory derives <br>
has lapsed. The retention must function not to represent on the basis of present proximal <br>
stimulation. It must function to represent some of what the preceding perceptual state or <br>
perceptual-state stage represented. The fact that the use state post-dates the end of the <br>
perceptual state that guides it and contains representational content derived from the <br><br>
