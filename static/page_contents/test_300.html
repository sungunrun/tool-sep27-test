300 The Iconic Nature of Perception</div>

of dots and names and the relative compactness of dots are mapped naturally to the pos-<br>
itions and relative compactness of the stations. The extended nature and linearity of the <br>
lines and the positions of the lines are mapped to the extended and linear natures of the <br>
rails and their positions.<br>
<br>
In accord with (2), spatial relations among the dots and lines preserve some spatial rela-<br>
tions among the stations and tracks. The betweenness relation among the dots preserves <br>
the betweenness relation among the stations: the middle dot is between the outer dots, <br>
and the Vermont Ave. station is between the USC and Western Ave. stations. By contrast, <br>
distance relations are not preserved under the mapping.<br>
<br>
In accord with (3), the map represents the relevant spatial relations partly via the <br>
mappings cited in (1) and (2).<br>
<br>
So the map represents the light-rail line and its stations iconically.<br>
<br>
Iconicity can occur with respect to higher-order as well as first-order representational <br>
properties. A history book represents its subject matter through conventional linguistic <br>
symbols. The spatial order of the narrative may map iconically into the temporal order of <br>
the events.301<br>
<br>
So far, I have explicated iconic <i>representation</i>. Iconicity is not a property purely of repre-<br>
sentations and representational contents. It is also a property of non-perceptual, sensory <br>
information registrations. A parallel explication applies to iconic <i>non-perceptual sensory <br>
information registration</i>. If a simple organism registers the day–night time cycle via a state <br>
that is excited during the day and a state that is quiet at night, each of the state-types icon-<br>
ic al ly registers segments of the diurnal time cycle. The 1–1 mapping of sensory states into <br>
day and night is natural and systematic. It would preserve the cyclic temporal relations <br>
between day and night. By contrast, a monkey’s danger call in response to a hawk may <br>
have no iconic element. It may not map into the registered physical facts in a way that <br>
preserves natural relations among those facts.<br>
<br>
A non-perceptual, non-representational sensory information registration state is iconic <br>
by virtue of meeting the following conditions:<br><br>
(1΄) There is a natural, systematic 1–1-into mapping from one or more aspects of the <br>
<br>
sensory registration state and corresponding aspects of a domain that the sensory <br>
<br>
state functions to register.<br>
<br>
(2΄) The mapping in (1΄) preserves correlations between some relations among struc-<br>
<br>
tural elements of the sensory registration state and natural relations among elements <br>
<br>
in the  registered domain.<br>
<br>
(3΄) The sensory registration state registers the relevant elements and their relations <br>
<br>
partly by way of the mapping of (1) and (2).<br><br>
The central notion in the explications (1)–(3) and (1΄)–(3΄) is that of being <i>natural</i>. <br>
I have no definition. Paradigmatically, natural relations, including 1–1 mappings, are of the <br>
sort that natural science (physics, chemistry, biology, geology, and so on) or mathematical <br>
science represents. This list of sciences is paradigmatic, <i>not definitional</i>. I take the notion <br>
of naturalness to be intuitive. In the light-rail map example, spatial mappings are evinced <br><br>
