kinds, like <i>x-ray machine</i>. Of course, perceptual systems can perceptually pick out what <br>
are in fact x-ray machines. We see x-ray machines. It is very doubtful that our perceptual <br>
systems represent them as x-ray machines. I focus on how perceptual systems characterize <br>
what they pick out.<br>
<br>
Determining what perceptual-attributive capacities a perceptual system has requires <br>
following scientific practice in not explaining a phenomenon (here, a perceptual compe-<br>
tence) via a more advanced capacity if a less advanced one is equally or better indicated by <br>
evidence. Suppose that there are two categories of <i>representata</i> prevalent in the en vir on-<br>
ment. One category is comprised of shapes, motions, and those bodies that exhibit the <br>
typical shapes and motions. Another category is comprised of bodies that are what they <br>
are because of some further property beyond shape, size, color, and motion. <i>X-ray machine</i> <br>
is in the latter category, because x-ray machines are not what they are entirely because <br>
of their shape and size. They are x-ray machines because they function to record x-rays. <br>
A body shaped like an x-ray machine is not thereby an x-ray machine. Similarly, dogs <br>
are not dogs purely because of their shape, size, or motion. Being a dog requires having <br>
a certain biological constitution or evolutionary history.<br>
<br>
Attributives for types of shapes, sizes, and motions, even in very specific groupings, are <br>
known perceptual capacities. There is considerable knowledge about how such perceptual <br>
attributives are produced from proximal stimulation. Having attributives for attributes <br>
that are not identical with attributes for spatial and motion attributes <i>requires</i> having <br>
 psy cho logic al capacities over and above capacities for attributing shapes, sizes, colors, <br>
and motions.<br>
<br>
For example, to autonomously represent something as a body, one must not only be <br>
able to group particulars that have a connected outer boundary. One must anticipate the <br>
entity’s holding the shape and perhaps having a certain rigidity or solidity. To autono-<br>
mously represent something as an x-ray machine, one must not only be able to group <br>
x-ray-machine-shapes and x-ray-machine-bodies. One must link an x-ray-machine-body <br>
with a function. To autonomously represent something as a dog, one must not only group <br>
dog-shapes and dog-bodies. One must be sensitive to the possibility that a body could <br>
look and move like a dog and not be a dog.127<br>
<br>
The reason for the requirement is that attributives just <i>are</i> kinds of representational capaci-<br>
ties. If attributives represent different attributes, they are different attributives. Since perceptual <br>
attributives are psychological capacities, the psychological capacities for attributing <i>x-ray-<br>
machine</i> or <i>dog</i> must differ from those for attributing <i>x-ray-machine-body</i> or <i>dog-body</i>.<br>
<br>
Perception is a type of sensory discrimination. So in the case of perceptual representa-<br>
tion, the differentiating psychological capacities must be capacities to operate in psycho-<br>
logically different ways in discriminating instances of any given attribute.128 The conditions <br>
can allow for perceptual memory and perceptual anticipation.<br><br>

<b>FOOTNOTES</b><br>
<b>Cont FN</b>127 I use ‘autonomously’ to lay aside usage that relies on an interlocutor. I assume that non-autonomous usage <br>
is not relevant to understanding perceptual attributives.<br>
<br>
128 A good illustration of these principles lies in ways a psychology is likely to treat a square and a regular <br>
diamond. These are the same properties. Because of difference in orientation (flat side on top for the square, cor-<br>
ner on top for the regular diamond), a perceptual system and a perceptual memory system are likely to treat the <br>
two ways of perceptually representing the same shape differently. The example comes from C. Peacocke, <i>A Study <br>
of Concepts</i> (Cambridge, MA: MIT Press, 1992). I do not adhere to the specific account that Peacocke associates <br>
with the example. I think that he correctly postulates a pre-conceptual level of content that allows for differences <br>
of content that are compatible with sameness of <i>representata</i>.</div>
