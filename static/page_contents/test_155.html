criticism of rejections of (aa1) and (aa2) 155</div>
<br><br>
It is not surprising that arguments by opponents of (AA1) and (AA2) are slight. Neither <br>
Pylyshyn and Fodor nor Schellenberg pay any attention to the fact that perceptual psych-<br>
ology systematically focuses on the triggering of perceptual attributives—specific types of <br>
repeatable perceptual representational competence—in the formation of perceptual states. <br>
Triggering perceptual attributives just is causation of instantiation of, or implementation <br>
of, perceptual attributive capacities. This focus is an empirical reflection of a basic fact that <br>
can be known apriori. A perception cannot perceptually single out a particular without <br>
doing so by exercising repeatable perceptual representational attributive competencies to <br>
connect to something repeatable about the particular that differentiates it from other <br>
causes of the perception.<br><br>

<b>FOOTNOTES</b><br>
<b>Cont FN</b>In this sense: If actual perceptual states M and M´ pick different particulars, they are thereby different states. This <br>
principle applies within my view.<br>
<br>
I do not, however, accept the particularism thesis. Perceptual content is entirely representational. Perceptual <br>
psychology is concerned with that sort of content. Moreover, constitution is a modal notion that covers non-<br>
actual but possible cases. I think that the same perceptual state M, specified in the most full and fine-grained way, <br>
could have picked out a different particular from the particular that it actually picks out. This is because a refer-<br>
ential application, which is literally a constituent of a perceptual state, is an event in the mind; and the same <br>
event, guided by the same attributives, could have picked out a different particular, in other non-actual but pos-<br>
sible circumstances. For discussion of this view, see my ‘Disjunctivism and Perceptual Psychology’. Schellenberg <br>
does not discuss this issue. So my rejection of her “semantic particularism” is partly off-stage. The main issues are <br>
(AA1) and (AA2).<br>
<br>
Schellenberg thinks that the general abilities involved in perception are not attributive—and that there are no <br>
attributives in perceptual states: S. Schellenberg, <i>The Unity of Perception</i> (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2018). <br>
A view could hardly be more out of touch with perceptual psychology, which takes as its main topic formation of <br>
types of attribution, in response to corresponding types in the environment. Writing about perception without <br>
knowing the science is a practice that I trust will gradually disappear from philosophy.</div>
