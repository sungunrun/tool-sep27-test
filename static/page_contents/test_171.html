Betokening and Four Types of Perceptual Attribution 171</div>
<br><br>
To someone not interested in semantics, there may seem no point in distinguishing <br>
betokening from referential application to the same instance. They are, however, different <br>
relations, even though they obtain in the same circumstances. Betokening is a relation <br>
between an exercise of an attributive—a capacity to characterize—and an instance. <br>
Referential application is a relation between an exercise of a referential capacity (the sche-<br>
matic that)—a capacity to pick out—and an instance. Betokening is induced by referential <br>
application.<br>
<br>
The indication-betokening distinction generates two distinctions among types of <br>
attribution.<br>
<br>
The first concerns the target of an attribution. Let us return to our example, assuming <br>
always visual-perceptual mode:<br><br>
(that x1)[(that x2)(that x3)(brown(x1), brown(x2), cubical(x1), cubical(x3), body(x1))].<br><br>
The attributives brown and cubical function to make attributions both to a particular body <br>
and to instances of their own types. For example, the perception functions to characterize <br>
some body as brown and to characterize some color-instance as an instance of <i>brown</i> <br>
(brownness).<br>
<br>
I want terms for these two types of attribution.<br>
<br>
I call an attributive’s function of attributing its indicated attribute-type to an instance of <br>
that same attribute ‘<i>intra-attribute attribution</i>’. In the example, brown, cubical, and body all <br>
engage in intra-attribute attribution. The attribution can be either accurate or not.<br>
<br>
I call an attributive’s function of attributing its indicated attribute-type, or its betokened <br>
attribute-instance, to an instance of <i>another</i> attribute ‘<i>cross-attribute attribution</i>’. Thus <br>
brown and cubical engage in cross-attribute attribution. They function to attribute their <br>
respective indicated attribute-types (and tokens) to an instance of another attribute—a par-<br>
ticular body. In the example, the attributive body engages only in intra-attribute attribution.<br>
<br>
I believe that the kind of attribution should be marked in the representational content. <br>
Plato emphasized that the type <i>cubical</i> itself is not cubical. What of a trope of <i>cubical</i>? <br>
A trope of <i>cubical</i> and a body that is cubical both make concrete in space and time the <br>
property-type <i>cubical</i>. Both are properly characterized by that type. But the trope and <br>
the body are characterized by <i>cubical</i> in different ways. A trope of <i>cubical</i> does not bear <br>
the same relation to <i>cubical</i> that a cubical body does. It is one thing to be an instance of an <br>
attribute (<i>cubical</i>). It is another to have or bear the same attribute, but be fundamentally <br>
identified by another attribute (<i>body</i>).<br>
<br>
The way in which an instance of <i>cubical</i> “is” cubical (is a trope fundamentally identified <br>
by <i>cubical</i>) differs from the way in which a body “is” cubical (has the property <i>cubical</i>). <br>
The former sense marks a core or fundamental constitutive relation. Instances of <i>cubical</i> <br>
are fundamentally constitutively cubical, and <i>cubical</i> is the fundamental identifying at tri-<br>
bute of the particular. The latter sense marks a less fundamental, in this case contingent, <br>
relation. The body is not even constitutively cubical. It could change specific shape and <br>
remain the same body.<br>
<br>
Even most constitutive properties are not fundamentally constitutive, or core identify-<br>
ing. For example, the property <i>outer-boundary-connected</i> is constitutive to the body. <br>
Similarly, the property <i>shape</i> is constitutive to the instance of <i>cubical</i>. Neither of these <br>
properties is fundamentally constitutive or core identifying.</div>
