representation of simple shapes.502 Although attentional feedback effects occur in V1-V3, <br>
they are small compared to effects in V4: the degree of enhancement of neural firing <br>
through attentional feedback is much greater in V4.503 V4 receives feedback from the <br>
 frontal, parietal, and temporal areas. It is affected by spatial and feature-based attention.504 <br>
Color constancies are prominent. Elementary shape, size, and position constancies appear <br>
to be supported.505 Depth perception through binocular disparity and refined figure-<br>
ground representation may be present. Some motion sensitivity and shape from motion <br>
processing have been identified.506<br>
<br>
V5, more often called MT (medial temporal cortex), functions mainly to support <br>
motion processing. It is located just outside—forward from—the occipital lobe. Ventral <br>
MT figures prominently in shape and object segmentation as well as response to motion, <br>
whereas dorsal MT is more functionally centered on motion. MT’s largest direct input is <br>
from V1. It also receives input from V2 and V3.507 MT is five synapses from the retina for <br>
its main input. It is a striking fact that MT receives direct input from sub-cortical areas—<br>
LGN and the superior colliculus—not passing through V1-V3. MT receives retinal signals <br>
as fast as or faster than V1, registering retinal motion in 10–50 ms from stimulus onset. It <br>
can provide feed-forward input to V1, although it is classically labeled ‘V5’. MT provides <br>
some of the fastest feedback to V1, as well as to V2 and V3.508<br>
<br>
MT is tuned primarily to retinal position, direction of retinal motion, speed of retinal <br>
motion, binocular disparity, and stimulus size. Direct, initial input from V1 carries infor-<br>
mation that correlates with local retinal motion—including its retinal direction and speed. <br>
MT enables computation of motion by coherent wholes, partly by carrying out its func-<br>
tion of object segmentation and through use of binocular disparity. MT appears to be <br>
involved in representation of depth and some distal-stimulus position in space. Thus <br>
elem en tary perceptual constancies may be supported by some MT activity.<br>
<br>
Neural responsiveness in MT is substantially affected by attention from parietal and <br>
frontal areas. It receives further extra-retinal input from proprioceptive registration of eye <br>
direction. Such information contributes to smooth pursuit of motion through eye move-<br>
ments. The extreme speed with which MT responds to retinal stimuli is linked to its func-<br>
tion not just of enabling detection of the presence, direction, and speed of motion (retinal <br><br>
