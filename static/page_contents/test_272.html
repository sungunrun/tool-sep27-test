holds between movers and their movements. (See Chapter 12, the section Further <br>
Attributives: Primitive Attribution of Causation, Agency.)<br>
<br>
No instance of the <i>relation</i>, <i>by</i>, as distinct from the <i>relata</i>, is perceived. That is why the <br>
relational attributive, byz3, is not equipped with a referential application. It is a compe-<br>
tence to connect motion with movers. Movers can be shape-instances, bodies, piles of <br>
stuff, or what not.271<br>
<br>
(Here-cego xp)(. . .(that x1). . .(LocL(c)(x4, xp, t1). . .Movementm1(i)(x4). . . is to be read: that4 <br>
movement in location L relative to ego-herep during (sub-)present time t1. Similarly, for <br>
the expression for the relational attributive LocL1(c)(x4, xp, (t1 + n)), except that there is a <br>
different location, L1, computed in relation to here-cego xp, and there is a later interval, <br>
t1 + n, measured to be temporal magnitude n after sub-present time t1.<br>
<br>
Browna1 and cubicalb1 make both intra-attribute attributions—by referential applica-<br>
tions subscripted 2 and 3, respectively—and cross-attribute attributions to the pur-<br>
ported body.<br>
<br>
Movementm1 and bodyd1 make only intra-attribute attributions. They attribute <i>movement</i> <br>
and <i>body</i>, respectively, to instances of <i>movement</i> and <i>body</i>. The betokening by the attribu-<br>
tive and the referential application by the schematic that represent the same particular. <br>
The instance of the indicated attribute-type <i>body</i> and the particular body are identical. The <br>
referential application that x1 effects an attributional application of the attributive bodyd1 <br>
to a body. Likewise, that x4 effects an attributional application of movementm1.<br>
<br>
Under unusual conditions, a perceiver can represent successive positions of a body dur-<br>
ing movement without perceiving movement through those positions. This rare condition <br>
is called ‘akinetopsia’.272 Then the perception would be as of the body at the successive <br>
positions, instead of the movement. Thus tracking a body and tracking the movement <br>
might be represented separately. I assume the simpler, more normal case here.<br>
<br>
Determining the locations of the body at the beginning and end of times within the <br>
interval during which a perception occurs is important for tracking and for connecting <br>
one perception with the next one that follows the saccade. For example, the last place that <br>
a body is perceived before a saccade needs to be held in short-term memory to aid in <br>
tracking the body after the saccade.<br>
<br>
If the motion continues to be perceived and tracked by the post-saccadic perception, a <br>
short-term perceptual memory bridges the temporal gap in perception produced by the <br>
saccade. Such a memory guides a subsequent perception to pick up where and when the <br>
current perception leaves off. (See Chapter 16, the section Trans-Saccadic Memory.)<br>
<br>
Emphatically, the representation of two successive locations for the body’s motion is an <br>
extreme abstraction from an actual iconic sequence of attributions that determines a tra-<br>
jectory. An artifact of my linguistic illustration of this aspect of the representational con-<br>
tent of a perception of movement is that it abstracts from the intermediate regions in the <br>
trajectory. A real perception would represent the movement as occupying all discernible <br>
spatial/temporally intervals in between.<br><br>
