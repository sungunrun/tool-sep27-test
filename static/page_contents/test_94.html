shape of one of the familiar middle-sized normal objects—ducks, rabbits, trees, tables, <br>
chairs. The idea is that bodies are picked out and tracked via their sortal shapes. This view <br>
is incompatible with what is known about the perception of objects and tracking in infants <br>
and other mammals. Changes of sortal shape that retain generic shape yield no surprise <br>
until late in infant development.96<br>
<br>
The fact that body representation is normally triggered by 3-D-volume-shape attribu-<br>
tions, where the shapes instantiate generic shape, derives from the centrality of bodies in <br>
the lives of animals. Animals with capacities to represent bodies must be able to do so <br>
quickly. Certain types of bodies are grouped by more specific shapes. For example, dan-<br>
gerous bodies with characteristic shapes (say, eagle-shaped eagle-bodies and reptile-<br>
shaped reptile-bodies), or con-specific bodies with characteristic shapes, or bodies of prey <br>
or other food with characteristic shapes, may be grouped and maintained in memory, <br>
with specific effects on action-responses. Some groupings are innate. Some are learned <br>
through antecedent perceptions. Faces, which are body-parts, are innately grouped. More <br>
specific faces, with specific geometries—such as mama’s face—are learned. All such group-<br>
ing is mainly by shape.<br>
<br>
Perceptual representations of body—representations of bodies as generic and represen-<br>
tations of bodies as of specific types—tend to be <i>loci</i> for adding and remembering further <br>
attributives. Memory files for individual bodies are set in the psychologies of many higher <br>
animals. Such files are <i>loci</i> for accumulating and “chunking” information. In remembering <br>
an object, one usually remembers other things about it. In learning, humans, and probably <br>
many mammals and birds, file new information specifically with representations as <br>
of bodies.<br>
<br>
Among first categorizations of an object with 3-D volume shape in the order of percep-<br>
tual processing are generic body attributions. Fastest categorizations are sketch-like. <br>
Closed figures are known to pop out.97 They do so because they reliably cue generic body <br>
representation.<br><br>

<b>Visual Spatial Perceptual Constancies and Body Categorization<br><br>

</b>When I use a hyphen, as in ‘dog-shaped’, ‘dog-shaped body’, or ‘dog-shaped dog-body’, <br>
I intend a sub-class of shapes or bodies. The sub-class is visually distinguished and per cep-<br>
tual ly grouped via shape. The hyphenated expressions do <i>not</i> imply that the perceiver or <br>
the perceiver’s perceptual system has an attributive that attributes the kind <i>dog</i>. (In some <br>
but not all cases, there may turn out to be an additional attributive, besides body, for the <br>
function of the body—such as the attributive mate.) A hyphenated shape attributive (dog-<br>
shaped) or categorizing attributive (dog-body) simply indicates a type of shape or body <br>
instantiated roughly by shapes or body-types that dogs have, regardless of whether, in a <br>
given case, it is a dog that has the shape or the body-type. I also intend to signal by the <br><br>
