138 PercePtual reference requires PercePtual attribution</div>
<br><br>
A perceptual discriminatory competence is what it is by virtue of patterns of causal rela-<br>
tions between specific conditions in the environment that come to be represented and the <br>
sensory states that respond to those conditions. A perceptual state whose only re peat able <br>
perceptual competence was a bare referential competence, typed by that or those, would not <br>
be explainable as getting its identity from the environmental condition that is represented. <br>
Saying that the that competence is present (partly) through causal inter actions with par-<br>
ticulars is true enough. So-saying provides no insight into perceptual representation’s func-<br>
tioning to pick out the specific particulars that it picks out. For the cases of bare perceptual <br>
reference envisioned by (Not-AA1), nothing about a represented particular, other than its <br>
being a particular, figures in determining the nature of the perceptual competence. There is <br>
no room for an explanation of how the perceptual capacity was determined—either <br>
innately or through learning—, through interactions with the en vir on ment, to apply—<br>
either in general or in specific cases—to some particulars and not  others. Such explanations <br>
are always possible. For example, the generic body attributive developed through sensory <br>
interactions with particulars that have connected outer boundaries. I think it necessary that <br>
such explanations are possible, given that there are perceptual states.<br>
<br>
I have couched the foregoing support for (AA1) in terms of availability of explanation. <br>
The arguments are thus meta-level. The issues about explanation connect to the more fun-<br>
damental issue of what we have reason to believe about facts that ground the explanations.<br>
<br>
The argument for (AA1) that centers on anti-individualistic explanation of perceptual <br>
kinds brings out a ground-level fact. Perceptual states depend for their specific identities <br>
(their representational contents) partly on specific environmental features, instances of <br>
which have long caused sensory states. A perceptual state functions to pick out particulars <br>
by connecting to, representing, specific environmental features. The representational iden-<br>
tities of perceptual states depend on <i>patterns</i> of interaction between environmental fea-<br>
tures and specific sensory capacities. The states function to pick out specific particulars <br>
partly by discriminating them from others by repeatable environmental attributes that the <br>
states have been molded to respond to. Indication of types and use of the types to help <br>
discriminate particulars just is perceptual attribution.<br>
<br>
I turn to an argument for (AA1) that sums up the main points discussed before. I think <br>
it apriori. Of course, showing that individuals have perceptual competencies is an em pir-<br>
ic al matter. I think that it is necessary and apriori that given, empirically, that there is such <br>
a thing as perception, (AA1) holds for it. I repeat (AA1):<br><br>
(AA1)  In every perceptual state, each occurrent, demonstrative-like, perceptual referential <br>
<br>
application must be associated with at least one applied perceptual attributive that func-<br>
<br>
tions to represent the (purportedly) picked out particular as being of some type.<br><br>
Here is the argument:<br><br>
1. The specific representational function of a perceptual state is to pick out, refer to, <br>
particulars in response to present causal stimulation.142 (Premise)<br><br>

<b>FOOTNOTES</b><br>
<b>Cont FN</b>142 A <i>particular</i>  is an unrepeatable entity. Particulars picked out in perception occur at specific places during <br>
specific spans of time.<br>
I assume that the picking out (the reference) is singular. There may be plural perceptual picking out as well. <br>
Nothing in the argument hinges on this issue.</div>
