circumstances. One can perceive a red ball against a white wall straight ahead. One’s <br>
perceptual system attributes color, 3-D volume shape, size, position, and body at tri-<br>
butes to the ball, and color, surface, and position attributes to the wall. An identically <br>
appearing, but different ball may be on another white wall elsewhere. That ball could <br>
have been put in the position of the ball one sees. One’s perceptual system could not <br>
perceptually discriminate the second ball from the first, unless both were presented at <br>
once, or one had been tracked in a way that insured that the other, in a given circum-<br>
stance, could not be the one tracked.153 One perceives the ball that one actually encoun-<br>
ters, not the ball that would have been indiscernible in another possible (or actual) <br>
encounter.<br>
<br>
A perceptual system’s inability, via perceptual attributives, to discriminate a particular <br>
from all other particulars (possible or actual) in other (possible or actual) perceptual <br>
encounters helps ground the irreducibility of occurrent, cause-dependent, referential <br>
application to perceptual attribution. Perceptual attribution—like description in language—<br>
depends ultimately on occurrent, demonstrative-like, referential applications to apply to a <br>
subject matter. It is apriori that perception requires causal connection to perceived entities <br>
in a context. The dependence on causation is required by perception’s being a discrimina-<br>
tive sensory capacity.<br>
<br>
Given limited information that perceptual systems necessarily work with, perceptual <br>
reference depends on a contextually applied referential capacity in addition to perceptual <br>
attribution. An attributive competence cannot distinguish a perceived entity by itself. <br>
Perception of an entity depends irreducibly on a capacity to discriminate it partly via <br>
causal connection to it.<br>
<br>
The main point of these reflections is that neither capacity can succeed without the <br>
other. Perceptual referential application without perceptual attribution is impossible. <br>
Perceptual attribution to particulars without referential application would be ungrounded, <br>
and perceptually vacuous. Perceptual attribution without referential application would be <br>
empty. Referential application without perceptual attribution would be blind.154<br><br>

<b>Criticism of Two Attempted Rejections of (AA1) and (AA2)<br><br>
</div>
</b>I now criticize two attempts to support rejection of (AA1), and by implication (AA2). <br>
I find both attempts slight and careless.<br>
<br>
Zenon Pylyshyn and Jerry Fodor assume that the only attributives are conceptual <br>
attributives.155 They think that by denying that perception involves conceptual attributives, <br>
they deny that perception involves any attributives. I will not criticize this view in detail. <br><br>

<b>FOOTNOTES</b><br>
<b>Cont FN</b>153 This example derives from Strawson’s duplicate scenes case, <i>Individuals:</i> <i>An Essay in Descriptive <br>
Metaphysics</i>, chapter 1. Strawson’s point about his example is somewhat different from my point about mine.<br>
154 The allusion is, of course, to Kant, <i>Critique of Pure Reason</i>, A51/B75: ‘Thoughts without content are empty, <br>
intuitions without concepts are blind’. Empirical intuition corresponds fairly well to the modern notion of per-<br>
ception. Kant was primarily interested in scientific cognition, hence thought and concepts. His famous dictum is <br>
epistemic, not psychological or representational. He is concerned with emptiness and blindness of purported <br>
scientific cognition. I focus on conditions for perceptual representation: conditions on the exercise of singular-<br>
referential and general-attributive capacities.<br>
155 For evidence of Fodor’s blindness to the distinction between conceptual and perceptual attributives, see <br>
J. Fodor, ‘Burge on Perception’, in E. Margolis and S. Laurence eds., <i>The Conceptual Mind: New Directions in the <br>
Study of Concepts</i> (Cambridge, MA: MIT Press, 2015). His review suggests that he did not read the book seriously.</div>
