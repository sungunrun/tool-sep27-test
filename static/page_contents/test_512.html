perceptual anticipation), and the sub-propositional actional states that interact with and <br>
are guided by these states form a causal basis for <i>computational</i> explanations.686 Models in <br>
visuomotor psychology of human actions do not appeal to beliefs or propositional-level <br>
intentions, even when such states are background causes for sub-propositional conative <br>
states. The models make no reference to states embedded in a structure of propositional <br>
inference. The explanations are neutral as to whether there is a cause by propositional <br>
attitudes from outside the computational system—say, a cause by a belief-intention com-<br>
bination. Computational explanation works, while confining causal factors to perceptual <br>
states, perceptual memory, perceptual anticipation, and perceptual-level conative states. <br>
So there is a type and level of explanation that does not always tell the full causal story. <br>
Such explanation suffices to give computational accounts of much human motor action.<br>
<br>
Explanations in perceptual-motor psychology appeal to representational states. The <br>
states are not propositional and not otherwise supra-perceptual. They are either percep-<br>
tual states or motor-command states whose attributional contents are largely or wholly <br>
perceptual attributives. There is substantial evidence of strong, fast connections between <br>
observation of actions and the priming of corresponding motor, primarily parietal, <br>
 areas.687 There is also evidence that visual representations and motor representations use <br>
the same types of attributions.688 It is not commonly noted that those representations con-<br>
sist largely or (I think) entirely of <i>perceptual</i> attributives, together with perceptual or <br>
motor referential applications. Indeed, it is hard to see how motor action could be <br>
explained representationally and computationally without taking it to be guided by, and to <br>
specify its targets and target-objects with, perceptual representations.<br><br>

<b>Broader Structure of Conation in Causing Relatively Primitive Action<br><br>
</div>
</b>Let us consider more closely the structure of relatively primitive action.<br>
<br>
Assume that a representational target-setting state is formed. Suppose that the state tar-<br>
gets gripping a body that is shaped and colored so as to mark it as edible. Suppose that <br>
motor-system attributives for functional properties, such as <i>edible</i>, and for motor acts, <br>
such as <i>gripping</i>, are borrowed from the visual or proprioceptive perceptual systems.689 <br>
Both perceptual representation and conative commands guided by perception (and per-<br>
ceptual anticipation) are associated with the very type of psychological set needed to <i>sup-<br>
plement</i> capacities to represent the application bases of these functional attributives. The <br>
additional associations enable the functional attributives to be distinct from the attribu-<br><br>
