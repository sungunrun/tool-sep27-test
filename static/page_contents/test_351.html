The Non-Planar Surface of the Scene 351</div>

mapping of a part of a background might be adjacent to the edge of a perceived entity in <br>
the foreground. <i>Big Surface</i> <i>Position</i> (abbreviated <i>Big Surface</i>) is comprised of all positions <br>
occupied by parts of surfaces seen at a time for a perceiver. Positions comprising a <i>Big</i> <br>
<i>Surface</i> vary with time and perceiver.<br>
<br>
<i>Big Surface</i> consists of spatial positions. The surface that it is depends on the projection <br>
of light rays from entities in those positions to the position of the observer. But the pos-<br>
itions that make up <i>Big Surface</i> and the mapping to the perceiver’s position are independ-<br>
ent of whether a perceiver makes use of the position. The mapping between <i>Big Surface</i> <br>
representational content described in this section is a natural mapping, not a representa-<br>
tional relation.<br>
<br>
It is <i>very</i> important to distinguish the natural mapping relation from the representa-<br>
tional relation. For any given position in <i>Big Surface</i>, many particulars occupy or overlap <br>
that position, and many attributes that those particulars have, are represented by the per-<br>
ceiver’s perceptual content. A perceptual state might represent not only a surface at a given <br>
location, but a slant of the surface, the surface’s texture, its color, or a color pattern on it, a <br>
3-D volume shape of which that surface is the facing part, a body that has that shape, and <br>
so on. These representations are founded on a spatial framework in the representational <br>
content that maps environmental space. The present mapping is to occupied positions, not <br>
to entities represented in the positions.<br>
<br>
The mapping also differs from representation in that representational content repre-<br>
sents (indicates) the occupants of the space as well as the positions in space. The mapping <br>
is always to occupied positions in space. It in effect follows the light rays that cause the <br>
perceptual state, and are utilized as parts of causal chains that support perceptual refer-<br>
ence, back to their originating, perceptually relevant positions in 3-D space. The mapping <br>
to positions correlates with a large surface in 3-D space—<i>Big Surface</i>. The surface is typ ic-<br>
al ly not a natural unit, and is not perceived as a surface. Visual perception represents 3-D <br>
volume shapes and bodies, as well as surfaces; and it applies surface to natural, bounded <br>
surface units, and to their parts.<br>
<br>
<i>Big Surface</i> is normally not a plane. Its “parts” are at different depths in 3-D space, rela-<br>
tive to the viewer. Some parts of <i>Big Surface</i> curve backwards or forwards with respect to <br>
the viewer. All visible surfaces, including backgrounds, make up the total surface into <br>
which visual perceptual representational content is mapped.372<br>
<br>
For present purposes alone, I count the sky and highlights as surfaces. They are, of <br>
course, not surfaces of anything. They are, however, perceivable, perhaps as instances of <br>
color. Perceptually localizing sky “surfaces” in space is usually indeterminate. The sky is <br>
commonly perceived as a background for perception of other things. It is assigned only <br>
ordinal depth, not position. I take the mapping to positions of sky surfaces as constrained <br>
but indeterminate. Other visible sub-surfaces occupying parts of <i>Big Surface</i> that are not <br>
perceived as at given distances still have determinate positions. The mapping is to those <br><br>

<b>FOOTNOTES</b><br>
<b>Cont FN</b>372 The points made in what follows about a mapping from parts of perceptual representational content to a <br>
surface in 3-D space must be qualified slightly to allow for <i>translucence</i>. Through translucent surfaces, one can <br>
visually perceive both a surface and something behind the surface. For example, one can perceive the surface of a <br>
window and something just behind that surface. Then the mapping of relevant parts of perceptual representa-<br>
tional content to a single surface is not 1–1. Cases of translucence are sufficiently unusual in natural scenes, that <br>
opaque surfaces can be taken to comprise the paradigm case.</div>
