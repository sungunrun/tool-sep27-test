than forming some perceptual constancies. The difference is a matter of best explanations <br>
of the system’s operations. Is the invariance best explained <i>causally</i> as involving a match <br>
primarily to proximal stimuli? Or is it better explained causally as involving representa-<br>
tion of the distal environment?<br>
<br>
I know of no sharp <i>criterion</i> for when a perceptual constancy is realized. Although it <br>
would be nice to have a criterion, I think it a mistake (made mainly by philosophers but <br>
occasionally by scientists) to <i>demand</i> a criterion. The distinction is determined in indi-<br>
vidual cases by inference to the best explanation.<br><br>

<b>Retinal Image Contour Registration and Surface Contour Perception<br><br>
</div>
</b>I turn to an example of a computation that illustrates more vividly a consideration that <br>
motivates perceptual psychology’s distinguishing non-representational informational <br>
states from representational states embedded in perceptual constancies. The example con-<br>
cerns registration of contours in the retinal image and their differences with contours in <br>
environmental space.78<br>
<br>
Again, the <i>retinal image</i> is the array of light frequencies focused by the lens into an <br>
image. Intuitively, it is the array of light frequencies that strike the retina—the main prox-<br>
imal stimulus of the visual system. The retinal image is a 2-D array. It is encoded by retinal <br>
receptors. The encodings are processed. When processing signals reach the primary visual <br>
cortex (V1), visual systems register local, sharp differences in registration of light intensity <br>
between adjacent regions in the image. Such local registrations are used to register con-<br>
tours of similar sharp differences. Such contours are still features of the retinal image, not <br>
environmental contours.<br>
<br>
For example, if a line of neurons fires at a much higher intensity than a line of adjacent <br>
neurons, the sharp difference in firing is marked as a candidate for being an edge segment. <br>
An edge segment is a sub-part of a contour. A contour is a longer line (which may be <br>
interrupted and then continue) of sharp differences in the proximal-stimulus light array—<br>
the retinal image. The <i>local</i> sharp differences are candidates for being <i>edge segments</i>, and <br>
certain sequences of such sharp differences are counted <i>contours.</i> Of course, the re gis tra-<br>
tions of counters in the retinal image function to correlate with, and they are often caused <br>
by, counterpart edges and contours in the distal environment. An environmental edge or <br>
contour might be the edge or contour of a side of a body, or the edge of a surface texture, <br>
or the edge of a shadow or patch of illumination. Or there may not be any environmental <br>
feature that corresponds. What we are concerned with, at this stage, is the candidate edge <br>
segments registered in V1. These edge segments are, of course, not segments of en vir on-<br>
men tal contours or environmental edges of, say, a surface.<br>
<br>
Registrations of edge segments in a retinal image are eventually connected into re gis tra-<br>
tions of contours in the retinal image. Such contours include lines that are broken and <br>
then continue. These contours often correlate with edges in physical space that are partly <br>
occluded. Neither registration of an edge segment nor a registration of a contour is taken <br>
in the science to be a <i>perceptual</i> representation of anything—not at this early stage of <br><br>
