for iconic memory.828 Thus what is available to free report without cue, or to partial report <br>
with cue after 300 ms, is much less than what is available to partial report with cue up to <br>
300 ms after stimulus offset.<br>
<br>
The timings have been refined. They represent averages among individual differences. <br>
Individuals’ performance can be extended in time by practice. Moreover, the fall-off in par-<br>
tial report superiority is exponential and approaches an asymptote. Some significant, <br>
though small superiority can be discerned, on average, up to 500 ms after stimulus offset.829<br>
<br>
It is not obvious whether perceptions retained in the memory are phenomenally con-<br>
scious. Subjects report having seen all or almost all items. It seems likely that some general <br>
aspects of the initial perceptions are phenomenally conscious. They are surely not rational-<br>
access conscious.<br>
<br>
To summarize the discussion so far: The sensory icon is retains the phenomenological <br>
perceptual image. Iconic memory retains more than one row. The representational infor-<br>
mation in iconic memory is not available to free report and is not rational-access con-<br>
scious. It is available through more indirect means. The memory capacity with the smaller <br>
capacity (4.5 items out of 12), whose contents and is available to full, free report, is (short-<br>
term) <i>working memory</i>.<br>
<br>
Many types of representational content are preserved in iconic memory: color, lightness, <br>
direction of rotary or linear motion, orientation of gratings, flicker, spatial location. Iconic <br>
memory is a <i>perceptual</i> memory—a memory that retains representational content from per-<br>
ceptual states. It retains perceptual attributives for shapes, bodies, letters, nu merals, and so <br>
on. It thus includes categorizing attributives.830 It seems obvious that neither visual sensory <br>
memory nor visual iconic memory is supra-perceptual in the sense we have been discussing.<br><br>

</b>Recent evidence suggests that there is a memory system called fragile visual short-term <br>
memory (FVSTM).831 It is not obvious that FVSTM is a distinct memory system. It bears <br>
close relations both to iconic memory and to visual working memory (discussed below). It <br>
may be an implementation of one or both of these systems. I discuss it as a system.<br><br>

<b>FN</b>828 Sperling, ‘The Information Available in Brief Visual Presentations’. The distinction between phenomenal <br>
and informational persistence, and between the sensory icon and iconic memory, was established by Coltheart, <br>
‘Iconic Memory and Visible Persistence’. See also V. Di Lollo and P. Dixon, ‘Two Forms of Persistence in Visual <br>
Information Processing’, <i>Journal of Experimental Psychology: Human Perception and Performance</i> 14 (1988), <br>

Psychology: Human Perception and Performance</i> 18 (1992), 1089–1100. In Coltheart’s magisterial article, I think <br>
that the distinction between phenomenal and informational persistence is mis-formulated. Whether an individ-<br>
ual can tell that the stimulus is still recorded is not the same as whether there is phenomenal persistence. Block’s <br>
work shows that, in principle, there may be phenomenal persistence left in the individual’s mind after the subject <br>
can tell introspectively, and report, whether it is there.<br>
