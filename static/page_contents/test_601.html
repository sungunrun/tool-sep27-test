been a swan picture and an eagle picture, when each picture in the sequence is presented <br>
for 107 ms.922 Subjects show retention if they are given a sequence of picture pairs or pic-<br>
ture quartets, thus having to retain a larger amount of information, with exposures of 240 <br>
ms per picture group.<br>
<br>
Earlier positioned pictures are lost to memory before later positioned pictures. <br>
Accuracy and retention-length for each presented picture does not depend on set size, or <br>
position in the set, for sequences of 6 to 20 pictures. Longer exposure times tend to <br>
increase accuracy.923<br>
<br>
The minimum exposure time that allows any picture in the sequence to be retained at <br>
above chance accuracy rate varies with the task. Retaining any picture in a sequence above <br>
chance varies with the task—including what sort of prime, and whether a prime, is pre-<br>
sented. Potter found retention at backwardly masked exposures as short as 13 ms, although <br>
there have been serious questions over whether the most effective masking pictures were <br>
used in those cases.924 There is no doubt, however, that retention with best, known mask-<br>
ing occurs at 50 ms of exposure, and longer.<br>
<br>
CSTM has been most extensively investigated via presentation of sequences of pictures. <br>
There is, however, some reason to think that a memory system parallel to or a sub-species <br>
of CSTM figures in retention of words. Sequences of words, letters, and numerals are <br>
shown under very short exposures. Whereas identification of a briefly exposed picture is <br>
formed very quickly, probably in 60–120 ms after stimulus onset, identification of a word <br>
is formed slightly slower, but at almost comparable speeds. These speeds of formation <br>
have been estimated from experiments that center on various types of priming, eye-<br>
tracking in reading, and observing fast sequences of displays.925<br>
<br>
With both symbol and picture primes, retention is better when attributional <i>structures</i> <br>
are perceptually activated. The structure, meaning, and plausibility of a sentence can be <br>
recalled at a rate of 12 words per second. When unrelated words are presented at that rate, <br>
only 2 to 3 words per second can be recalled. Since such sentences can be encountered for <br>
the first time, these studies show rapid formation and recall of new relationships among <br>
existing concepts, associated with the words, even though pre-existing associations and <br>
understanding are relied on in these processes.926<br>
<br>
This result is similar to the result already cited for pictures: If subjects are shown rapid <br>
sequences of pictures, where a target is previously set, by either a picture or a word, <br><br>
