the color tropes may be the only particulars that the system has any way of discriminating <br>
from other particulars. The system discriminates them by their color-types and by causal <br>
chains to them.<br>
<br>
When, in later stages of perception-formation in a complex system, color (or lightness) <br>
vision is supplemented with spatial vision, thereby being capable of discriminating sur-<br>
faces and perhaps bodies, the system does not lose its capacity to perceive color (or light-<br>
ness) instances, something it had done at earlier stages of perception-formation. So more <br>
complex systems, like perhaps ours, that pick out colors first do not lose perceptions <br>
of color-instances when spatial vision supplements color vision, enabling reference to <br>
bearers of color.174, 175<br>
<br>
The broad form of the argument applied here is this: In the simple-animal case and in <br>
the early-stage-of-a-complex-system case only a color trope is perceptually picked out. <br>
Although there are two different causal chains affecting the system—a chain initiated by <br>
the reflectance in the particulate matter (the color trope) and the shape of the aggregate <br>
particulate matter itself (the bearer of the color), there would be no difference in exercised <br>
competencies, between types of attribution or types of attributive being applied. Two dif-<br>
ferent particulars cannot be perceived in such circumstances. Since the perceptual compe-<br>
tence that is triggered in such cases is specifically a competence for color, or reflectance, it <br>
is the color trope that is perceived. So if kind attributives (bearer-attributives), which <br>
are grounded in shape attributives, are not applied, no bearer is perceived. Only tropes <br>
are perceived. When the more complex system supplements exercises of color competence <br>
with exercises of shape competence, a bearer of color can be discriminated. But then the <br>
color competence and its application is not lost. It still applies to the color tropes that it did <br>
before the competence was supplemented with shape competence. So perception picks out <br>
color tropes even in complex systems that also pick out bearers of color.<br>
<br>
I turn to a third consideration that supports taking perception normally to include per-<br>
ception of—referential application to—feature-like property-instances. This consideration <br>
centers on the semantics of <i>de re</i> representation. It brings out that perception of tropes <br>
makes a natural and intuitive difference to accuracy conditions for perception.<br>
<br>
<i>De re</i> <i>representation</i> is direct, non-inferential, referential representation of an entity that <br>
is not represented entirely through attribution.176 Referential applications in perception <br>
are paradigmatic examples of <i>de re</i> representation. Perceptual representation is soaked <br><br>

<b>FOOTNOTES</b><br>
<b>Cont FN</b>174 Imagine a case in which one is enveloped in a fog of a single unmodulated color. One cannot discern any <br>
body, shape, or ordinal depth relation within the fog of gaseous material. I think that one perceives the color <br>
trope and attributes the specific color to it. One probably also perceives the gaseous particulate matter that <br>
reflects the light. I conjecture that to do so, one must apply some spatial attributives, at least some ordinal depth <br>
attributive that sets the light in some depth relation to one’s nose and outside one’s psychology. Such a rudimen-<br>
tary spatial attribution might enable one to attribute some sort of attenuated surface attributive. The surface is <br>
made up of visible particulate matter that reflects light into the visual system. The case is rather like seeing a <br>
uniform blue sky and nothing else. One sees the particulate matter that reflects light and one perceptually at trib-<br>
utes the color. One attributes an ordinal depth that is further away than one’s nose, but at some indeterminate <br>
distance. The seen matter forms an analog of a surface, without seen boundaries and without definite shape in <br>
depth. Here, as elsewhere, accounting for seeing the sky is an interesting issue.<br>
175 A less difficult but still interesting case is one in which one sees a shaft of colored light with well-defined <br>
boundaries, as when one sees a light stream of a certain color cutting across the nave of a cathedral. Then, one’s <br>
perception localizes the stream in space and attributes a shape, size, and orientation to the light stream. Here I <br>
think that one sees the particulate matter off which the light reflects, and one sees not only the color trope but its <br>
bearer. The bearer is in fact the particulate matter. One again attributes an attenuated surface, which is in fact <br>
made up of the matter, and perhaps even an object (though not a body) with 3-D volume shape.<br>
