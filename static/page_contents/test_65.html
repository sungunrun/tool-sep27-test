perceptual constancies vs other invariances 65</div>
<br><br>
different representational contents and different psychological properties, stemming from <br>
different proximal stimulation—are coordinated in indicating and attributing a given size <br>
as that size.<br>
<br>
It is important to keep in mind that perceptual constancies are capacities or competen-<br>
cies. The competencies are rarely perfectly realized. Perceptual states are normally mis-<br>
taken in certain situations. Capacities to represent a given attribute or particular as that <br>
attribute or particular can be systematically misled in non-standard conditions. Even in <br>
favorable conditions, such competencies are commonly realized only approximately. <br>
Perceptual attribution of scalar properties is usually only approximately accurate, not strictly <br>
accurate. (See Chapter 15, the section Attention and Accuracy.) “Significantly” <br>
changing the proximal stimulation will usually yield imperfect realization of constancy—<br>
especially for scalar properties or other magnitudes, like reflectance. So although percep-<br>
tual constancies are <i>competencies</i> to represent a <i>single</i> attribute or particular accurately in <br>
different stimulus situations, <i>exercises</i> of perceptual constancies frequently yield only <br>
approximate constancy, and even so, only in a limited range of cases.<br>
<br>
Ranges of stimulus contexts in which a constancy can be exercised successfully, as well <br>
as degree of approximation to successful exercises of a constancy, vary with the specific per-<br>
ceptual constancy, with the type of perceptual system, and with the perceiver. Outside a given <br>
range of stimulus contexts, errors mount; and the competence loses hold. Ordinal depth con-<br>
stancy is reliably accurate within about 200 meters for humans. 3-D-volume-shape constan-<br>
cies in human vision are reliable only within shorter distances, and are much more <br>
approximate and less reliable than ordinal depth constancy—both for humans and for other <br>
animals. Human size constancy is better at approximating actual size under different stimulus <br>
conditions than lightness or shape constancy is at approximating lightness or shape.<br>
<br>
Given that perceptual constancies are capacities or competencies, they entail nothing <br>
about representational success rates. They are <i>competencies</i> to succeed in representing an <br>
attribute or particular despite significant differences in proximal stimulation. Success <br>
rates, even rates of approximate success, are orthogonal to perceptual objectification and <br>
perceptual constancy. One can have a competence that has to contend with many per-<br>
form ance interferences. There is no good apriori inference from there being a competence <br>
to how reliable it is or what rate of success it has in realizing its representational function. <br>
Having a perceptual constancy is compatible with making mistakes most of the time in <br>
most contexts. An ability is not a probability. Perceivers can, and do sometimes, have <br>
weak, context-limited constancies, as well as impressive ones.<br>
<br>
I say all this to emphasize that perceptual constancies are <i>competencies</i>. At least in actual <br>
perceivers, competencies are not perfect mechanisms for representational success. Despite <br>
these qualifications, perceptual constancies are, I think, among the most remarkable of all <br>
psychological capacities. It is deeply important to understand them. Understanding them <br>
hinges largely on understanding how perceptual psychology understands them.<br><br>
