demonstrative-like element in the perceptual system. Sometimes, I think without the <br>
slightest good reason, the existence of feature-instances (tropes) is denied. (See Chapter 6, <br>
the section Perception of Property-Instances.)<br>
<br>
A similar view was advanced by Strawson, not to provide a surrogate for perception, but <br>
to illustrate a stage in the development of representation.41 He called it a <i>feature­ placing</i> <br>
stage. Strawson’s idea was that we cannot pick out particulars unless we have mastered <br>
criteria for individuating the particulars. Although he presented the feature-placing stage <br>
mainly as an instructive fiction, he seems to have believed that animals and young chil-<br>
dren go through it.<br>
<br>
Although both the positivist and Strawsonian invocations of feature-placing were devel-<br>
oped in serious philosophical frameworks, the frameworks are now museum pieces, not <br>
serious philosophical positions. Sense-data theory has been dead for over seventy years. <br>
Strawson’s idea that referring to particulars requires mastering criteria for individuation—<br>
held in common with many other distinguished philosophers—has been dead for fifty <br>
years.42 Recurrent, scattered invocations of the view in present philosophical chatter lack <br>
the excuse of being motivated by a serious philosophical, much less scientific program.<br>
<br>
I mention some reasons for not taking the view seriously as a surrogate, much less an <br>
account, of perception. A relatively minor point is that perception need not always use a <br>
spatial map. Perception of instances of color or of motion that lack spatial attributions are <br>
possible, and probably actual. Picking out particulars is the fundamental function of per-<br>
ception. Spatial frameworks are deep and widespread, but less fundamental.<br>
<br>
A more central point is that the position is revisionist about perceptual psychology <br>
without any reason for being so. The position has not been shown to do explanatory work <br>
not already done in the science. The science clearly takes perceivers to represent “objects” <br>
and other particulars, usually as located in specific spatio/temporal positions. These par-<br>
ticulars are occurrently represented—perceived—partly on the basis of well-understood <br>
occurrent causal chains. That is what it is for perception to pick out particulars via referen-<br>
tial applications. For example, a moving body is picked out and tracked visually. On the <br>
surrogate account, nothing is literally seen. No particular, other than a spatio-temporal <br>
position, is picked out. One cannot literally see spatial positions, temporal moments, or <br>
universals—the only elements allowed in the account. The basic problem is that the view <br>
is incompatible with our understanding of perception of particulars via occurrent causal <br>
chains that extend from the perceived particulars to occurrences of perceptual states. This <br>
understanding is, I think, apriori. Its empirical application to cases is well established. So <br>
the surrogate view is incompatible both with our understanding of what perception is and <br>
with scientific explanation. It provides no serious reason for opposing either.<br>
<br>
The appeal to the three central elements in perceptual representation codifies the obvi-<br>
ous. Its strength is missed only if one fails to see how notions like demonstrative-like <br><br>
