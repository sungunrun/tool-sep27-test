I believe that one feature of the relation between perceptual and perceptual-level cap-<br>
aci ties, on one hand, and conceptual and propositional capacities, on the other, is that the <br>
former have a kind of self-sufficiency. I believe that no type of perceptual state <i>constitu-<br>
tively</i>, or by computational law, depends for its formation on conceptual influence, or on <br>
influence from propositional states. Any perceptual state can be generated computation-<br>
ally without any concept’s or propositional state’s figuring in the computation. Formation <br>
of perceptual representations does not depend essentially on conceptual resources. <br>
Similarly, relations between perceptual states and other perceptual-level states do not <br>
depend computationally on input from conceptual or propositional resources, and could <br>
in principle occur without such resources. As far as is now known, computational ex plan-<br>
ations of how perceptual memories and perceptual anticipations are formed from percep-<br>
tual states, the perceptual-level initiations of attention and their effect on perception, the <br>
task dependence of perception on conative states, and so on, can be computationally <br>
explained without reference to conceptual or propositional input. Computational ex plan-<br>
ations in the psychophysics of perception do not include reference to conceptual states.<br>
<br>
None of this is to say that concepts cannot influence what perceptions are formed. <br>
Instructions in propositional form by scientists influence perceptual search and make per-<br>
ceptual processing take courses that it would not have taken, apart from the instructions. <br>
They thereby influence perceptual processing. I think that there is a sense in which, even <br>
in these cases, they do not enter the process itself. Causal computational sequences that <br>
lead from non-conceptual input into a perceptual system always suffice to explain the <br>
 formation of perceptual states.<br>
<br>
Similarly, certain types of conceptually initiated attention affect perceptual-level atten-<br>
tion commands, and thereby affect attention during perceptual processing. The attention <br>
affects the processing. So perceptual processing can be causally affected by conceptual <br>
states, even as the processing occurs. However, causal-computational sequences that begin <br>
with the perceptual-level attention commands, or with attention within perception, omit <br>
reference to the conceptual antecedents, yet are explanatorily satisfying. In principle, the <br>
same attention commands and attention effects could have been formed without concep-<br>
tual influence. Although not always the whole causal story, explanation by reference to the <br>
concept-free causal computational sequence is, in a sense to be discussed, sufficient to <br>
provide systematic explanation of the formation of a perception. I think that the concept <br>
of perceptual <i>system</i>, and distinctions between perceptual-level and conceptual-level <br>
 psychological kinds can be well understood by reference to these facts.<br>
<br>
In the last two decades, scientific understanding of visual processing has substantially <br>
changed. It used to be thought that processing was much more “bottom up”. It is now <br>
known to have substantial <i>recurrent</i> processing–processing that proceeds from more ana-<br>
tomically downstream visual areas back upstream toward initially early areas. Neural pro-<br>
cessing begins with the onset of a proximal stimulus and proceeds to early processing <br>
areas, such as the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN), the primary visual cortex (V1), and <br>
the middle temporal area (MT). It then proceeds to visual areas, V2–V4, the infero-<br>
temporal cortex (IT), parietal areas, and the pre-frontal cortex. From the beginning, <i>hori-<br>
zontal</i> processing takes place, for example, among areas within LGN or V1. Later, <i>recurrent</i> <br>
processing begins, from V2-V4 and beyond, back to V1 (and similarly for each later <br>
stage—V2 . . .). So processing is much more multi-directional than was thought as recently <br>
as the 1990s. The neurological sequence has psychological analogs.</div>
