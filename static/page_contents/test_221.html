There may be a level of perceptual length-attribution that is canonical. If there is such a <br>
level, each length would have an analog of a proprietary name (like ‘1 meter’). But basic, <br>
primitive visual representation of spatial magnitudes—like length, size, and shape—<br>
depends on visually determining spatial relations to the viewer.217 It follows from the con-<br>
tents of the different perceptual attributives for an edge of a given length that each <br>
represents that length. This equivalence could give rise to a derivative attributive for the <br>
length. Such derivative attributives might be canonical. They would mark generic psycho-<br>
logical states, not ground-level, specific perceptual states. Such generic states would plaus-<br>
ibly be amodal. Then they could ground coordination between different modalities of <br>
sense perception. (However, such coordination could be grounded in intermodal transla-<br>
tions that matched modally different representations for the same spatial magnitudes.) <br>
Perspectivally different ways of representing a given length in different applications of the <br>
egocentrically anchored coordinate system are, however, psychologically and representa-<br>
tionally basic. Perceptual attribution is always, fundamentally, from a specific, limited <br>
viewpoint.<br>
<br>
I discuss these three conditions in some detail, especially the second. Initially, I illus-<br>
trate their import in crude ways. I caution against allowing the crudity to mislead on the <br>
main points. Initially, I focus on non-relational spatial properties, like size and shape, not <br>
on relational spatial properties, like orientation and distance. This focus serves to make <br>
anti-minimalist points intuitive. The illustrations serve as background for a general point <br>
that I shall argue for. The general point is that there is a many–one relation between visual <br>
perceptual attributives that indicate and attribute any spatial attribute (non-relational or <br>
relational), on one hand, and the spatial attribute itself, on the other.<br>
<br>
Visual perceptual representation has a structure relevantly like that of a realist picture <br>
or a map. I discuss this point, and empirical support for it, in Chapter 9. Here I cite some <br>
consequences of this fact for understanding perceptual attribution in perceptual spatial <br>
constancies, for length, size, and shape.<br>
<br>
Take a visual representation of an environmental edge—a surface’s border. Imagine that <br>
the representation has the form of a drawing of the edge as in 3-D space. The drawing is a <br>
line. The drawing represents the edge as an edge. It represents the edge as an edge of a <br>
surface. With enough cues in the drawing, the shape of the line can represent the edge’s <br>
shape as a specific shape. And the length of the line can represent the edge’s length as a <br>
specific length. Other aspects of the drawing, including the angle of the line, represent the <br>
edge’s orientation as an orientation. The minimalist elaboration of (I) (see this Chapter, the <br>
section Minimalism and Color Constancy) is right to hold that, normally, per-<br>
ceptual attribution of one attribute is connected with attributions of others. In a relatively <br>
rich drawing, one cannot draw an edge as being in 3-D space without drawing its (approxi-<br>
mate) length, shape, and orientation. Normally, one visually represents an environmental <br>
edge as such by representing its length, shape, and orientation, as such.<br>
<br>
Suppose that one accurately sees the top edge of a rectangular surface oriented up-<br>
down in the frontal-parallel plane. Imagine a realist drawing of the edge. It is straight, <br>
horizontal, and a certain length, <i>l</i>. Consider change in the surface’s orientation. Suppose <br><br>

<b>Cont FN</b>217 Attributions of spatial properties, such as size, are computed initially through computations of attributions <br>
of spatial framework relations, such as distance. Of course, distance is <i>from</i> the position on the perceiver, referred <br>
to by an egocentric index. See, for example, Kaufman, Kaufman, Noble, Edlund, Bai, and Kind, ‘Perceptual <br>
Distance and the Constancy of Size and Stereoscopic Depth’.</div>
