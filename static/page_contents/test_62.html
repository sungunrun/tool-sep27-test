inference. He does not use quite these terms. I discuss the inference, and the resulting <br>
account, because it would provide a prima facie alternative to the present account of the <br>
joint between mere sensing (detection) and perceptual representation—the account that <br>
cen ters on perceptual constancies.<br>
<br>
I think that this alternative account uses tools that are much too blunt to make the key <br>
distinctions. Unless one considers how a proximal stimulus is processed, one cannot know <br>
the nature or type of the resulting states. There are cases in which an animal is not single-<br>
cue-bound but lacks a representational psychology by both my lights and Sterelny’s. There <br>
are cases in which animals are or could be single-cue-bound, but have a representational <br>
psychology.<br>
<br>
The former case is illustrated by snails that have non-perceptual sensory registration <br>
systems that are not single-cue-bound by the foregoing account.54 The snails have sensory <br>
systems in two modalities—a proprioceptive system sensitive to gravity and a visual <br>
 system sensitive to light. The effect of light on behavior and that of gravity on behavior can <br>
operate independently or in tandem. A behavioral response can occur as a result of either <br>
a proprioceptive cue or a light-based cue, or through some combination of the two. This <br>
case meets the condition for not being single-cue-bound. It is not plausible that this <br>
responsiveness to different cues evinces mentality.<br>
<br>
A case in which an animal’s response is cue-bound, but the underlying sensory system <br>
is representational, is Sterelny’s own example of the chickens. Their strongest alarm-call <br>
response to a predator may derive from some optimal combination of response to speed, <br>
size, and shape. There is no question that chickens perceptually attribute speed, size, and <br>
shape, through vision, as different environmental properties.55 There is little question that <br>
chickens represent (either perceptually or conatively) the property <i>predator</i>. This point <br>
shows that Sterelny’s diagnostic tool does not provide insight into the nature of the under-<br>
lying internal states. The conception of single-cue detection shows more about the natures <br>
of the discriminative problem and behavioral responses to it than the nature of the sen-<br>
sory system that operates to solve the problem. It is not an adequate tool for delineating <br>
boundaries of mind.<br>
<br>
Of course, the fact that the chicken has different sensory capacities for shape, size, and <br>
motion is known through the chicken’s exhibiting perceptual constancies for each of the <br>
three property ranges. The investigations that show that chickens have perceptual con-<br>
stancies might show that in <i>those</i> cases, chickens exhibit a similar response to very differ-<br>
ent “cues”. Then although the chickens have many cue-bound responses, they would (even <br>
in guiding <i>those</i> responses) not be cue-bound agents. The notion of <i>single cue</i> that Sterelny <br>
relies upon is too vague to be sure that this result is inevitable. If it is inevitable—given <br>
whatever the relevant notion of a single cue is—it is because the cue-bound proposal <br>
 happens to apply to an agent, at least for a single modality, if and only if the agent has per-<br>
ceptual constancies. But perceptual constancies, not not-being-cue-bound, would mark <br>
first forms of genuine representation. Being cue-bound in particular cases is compatible <br>
with exercising perception in those cases. By focusing on externally described cues and <br><br>
