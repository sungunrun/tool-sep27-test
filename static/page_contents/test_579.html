surrounding it are stable. If the target is significantly displaced after the saccade, the bias is can-<br>
celled. More specifically, the visual system was taken to follow these steps over the course of a <br>
saccade. During a fixation, TSM stores aspects of the coming saccadic target—outside the area <br>
of foveal fixation—and aspects of entities near the target. So TSM becomes a source of informa-<br>
tion for determining whether the target and items near it are represented as having similar <br>
attributes (especially including position in 3-D space) after the saccade as they were represented <br>
as having before it. Matching attribution of location, size, and shape of target entities and nearby <br>
entities, before and after a saccade, is crucial to a stable representation of the environment. If <br>
representations in the new fixation match those in the previous fixation, the stability bias is vin-<br>
dicated. Only significant changes in representation between the saccades threatens the bias. <br>
Clearly, the model relies on TSM’s retaining visual perceptual information from before a sac-<br>
cade, and making it available after the saccade.845 So one function of trans-saccadic memory is <br>
to help stabilize visual representation of the world despite frequent eye shifts.<br>
<br>
Of course, visual systems are not perfect in handling every possible type of stimulus. <br>
Stimuli very briefly presented just before or after a saccade are systematically mis-localized, <br>
in the direction of a future saccade or a past fixation. Successful integration requires some-<br>
thing like normal stimulus exposure before and after the saccade.846<br>
<br>
In the last twenty-five years, there has emerged substantial evidence of functional inter-<br>
action between anticipation of a future perceptual state and the state itself, and also <br>
between a perceptual state after a saccade and the memory of the state before the saccade. <br>
Reading speed is increased when some part of an upcoming word is peripherally visible, <br>
although such words cannot be deciphered in the periphery. Statistical analyses show that <br>
human perceptual systems combine pre-and post-saccadic views of a target using a <br>
weighted sum, with assignment of weights being based on the relative precision of foveal <br>
post-saccadic fixations and peripheral pre-saccadic fixations of the same targets, slightly <br>
over-weighting foveal representations. If current visual information is degraded in quality, <br>
TSM information is weighted more heavily.847<br>
<br>
A second function of TSM, in addition to helping to stabilize visual representation <br>
despite saccades, is to integrate and guide acquisition of high-quality, precise foveal visual <br>
information, especially in visual search. TSM retains not only low-quality peripheral <br>
information and uses it in stabilizing visual representation. It uses the same information <br>
in guiding visual search. Memory of a peripherally represented but practically important <br>
visual target guides a saccade to the target’s location. Moreover, TSM retains high-quality <br>
foveal information in building up, through automatic or controlled scanning of the en vir-<br>
on ment, a rich, relatively precise representation. This function of TSM is central in search <br>
tasks. Although TSM is short-term memory with a limited duration, it retains information <br>
from more than one or two fixations in the past.848<br><br>
