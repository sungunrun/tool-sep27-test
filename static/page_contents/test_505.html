Relatively Primitive Action 505</div>

applies to very primitive organisms. Worms and snails crawl. Paramecia swim. Some or all <br>
of these organisms lack perception or any other kind of psychological state whose forma-<br>
tion is causally explained by reference to states with veridicality conditions. Not all action <br>
is guided by representational states.673 (See Chapter 2, the section Representation <br>
and Information Registration.)<br>
<br>
Much current action theory in philosophy still pays little attention to accounts of action <br>
in science. Most action theory vastly over-intellectualizes action. The methodology is <br>
intuitive reasoning about a small stock of cases. The focus is on planned, deliberative <br>
action, guided by practical reason. That focus is innocent and understandable. Many <br>
important philosophical issues—those of freedom and responsibility and those of what it <br>
is to be moral, or practically reasonable—bear specifically on action guided by rational <br>
powers. However, quite a lot of modern action theory uses this focus to characterize what <br>
action <i>is</i>. Action is taken, constitutively, to be caused in non-deviant ways by beliefs and <br>
intentions, or desires, that are integrated in a network of propositional reasoning. Or it is <br>
taken to be constitutively answerable by the agent to reason-requesting questions about <br>
why the agent acted. Or it is taken essentially to involve propositional representation, plan-<br>
ning, a sense of the good, or being responsible.674<br>
<br>
Some authors simply deny that snails or worms act, because they meet none of the <br>
favored descriptions of action. Such approaches have gone astray. They focus on im port-<br>
ant topics, worthy of philosophical reflection. But to understand action <i>per se</i>, the focus is <br>
too narrow. To understand action, one must situate higher human action within an array <br>
of other types.<br>
<br>
The action that I center on here is <i>not</i> the most primitive type. The most primitive type is <br>
not guided by representation, even perception, at all.675 The action is guided only by non-<br>
representational sensory registration. It is, <i>roughly</i>, centrally and endogenously caused motor <br>
movement, or attentional orientation, by the whole animal that serves whole-animal func-<br>
tions—crawling, eating, predating.676 Such actions were selected for because of they contrib-<br>
uted to finding food and mates, or avoiding danger. Flees, snails, worms, paramecia almost <br>
surely lack perceptual or other representational states. Some or all these organisms act.<br>
<br>
My topic is a slightly more sophisticated type of action: action guided by perceptual-<br>
level representational states—primarily, action guided by perception. Many agents whose <br>
actions are guided by perception lack propositional attitudes. Such agents lack reasons. <br>
They lack propositional planning, a sense of the good, and a capacity to be held re spon-<br>
sible for acts, in anything like the way modern action theory discusses responsibility. <br>
Spiders, bees, fish, reptiles act in ways guided by perception. It is doubtful that any of these <br>
animals engages in the types of agency that dominate modern action theory. Some human <br>
action occurs at this level.<br><br>
