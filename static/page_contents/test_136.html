136 PercePtual reference requires PercePtual attribution</div>

distal causal source and the formed perceptual state, the accuracy or inaccuracy of the <br>
perceptual state is determined. The extended causal explanation—from distal source to <br>
perceptual state—provides an explanation of the state’s being accurate or inaccurate.<br>
<br>
Explanation of the accuracy or inaccuracy of a state requires that the state’s exercise of <br>
repeatable perceptual competencies be evaluable for representational success or failure in <br>
their role of serving the perceptual state’s function to pick out particulars. The only rele-<br>
vant role of the repeatable competencies to perceptually discriminate environmental types <br>
in serving the picking-out function is the role of characterizing particulars that are pur-<br>
portedly picked out. The science’s explanations of accuracy and inaccuracy in picking out <br>
particulars centers on the accuracy of its attributive aspects in characterizing the particu-<br>
lars that those aspects function to help pick out.<br>
<br>
One can understand more about why (AA1) is true by reflecting on its negation:<br><br>
(Not- AA1) There can be referential singular applications in perception unaccompanied by <br>
<br>
perceptual attributives.<br><br>
(Not-AA1) holds that the general competence to single out a particular (a non-repeatable <br>
instance of some attribute) in perception can sometimes be exercised without any perceptual <br>
attributive. If the position acknowledges the obvious fact that perception is always (partly) <br>
an exercise of repeatable abilities, it must hold that the schematic that or those abilities can <br>
be the only repeatable representational abilities exercised in a perceptual state. The that or <br>
those abilities are repeatable perceptual abilities to pick out or refer to particulars.<br>
<br>
Such a view holds that the referential competence selects a particular in the en vir on ment <br>
on the basis of proximal stimulation, without help from any characterizing perceptual com-<br>
petencies. On this view, the function of perception to discriminate particulars can be exer-<br>
cised entirely by singling out one or more perceived particulars, full stop. No attributions <br>
need occur. The accuracy condition of the perceptual state is fulfilled if a particular is per-<br>
ceived. Otherwise, the perceptual state is inaccurate. Different proximal stimulation might <br>
have led to perception of a different particular, or to a failure of perception.<br>
<br>
What is wrong with such a position? One thing wrong is that it closes off availability of <br>
the type of explanation that is central to perceptual psychology. It closes off explanation <br>
that connects a specific type of proximal stimulation to a specific type of perceptual com-<br>
petence that such stimulation causes to be exercised. Ways of discriminating particulars, <br>
and what sorts of particulars are discriminated, hinge on and vary with specific types of <br>
proximal stimulation. Specific ways of discriminating particulars track specific en vir on-<br>
men tal features by which perceived particulars are discriminated.<br>
<br>
The exercise of a that or those general competence does not alone suffice to ground any <br>
explanation at all of how the specific perceptual state depends on a specific type of prox-<br>
imal stimulation. Take the class of proximal stimulations that trigger the alleged percep-<br>
tual states that consist in purported perceptual reference <i>neat</i> or <i>bare</i>. There is nothing <br>
about such a perceptual state that links with the type of stimulation and the type of en vir-<br>
on men tal conditions to ground explaining success or failure in the perception, or exercise <br>
of a perceptual competence. There is no explanation in terms of a repeatable perceptual <br>
competence that derives from specific proximal stimulation and specific environmental <br>
distal stimulation at all. This is absurd. The lack of explanation derives from the bareness <br>
of the unsupplemented referential competence, that.</div>
