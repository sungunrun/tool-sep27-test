492 Perceptual-Level Representation and Categorization</div>
<br><br>
<i>violin-body</i>. There are conceptual representations, both linguistic and non-linguistic, <br>
I think, of the same attributes. There are, for example, non-iconic linguistically expressed <br>
concepts, and iconic non-linguistically expressed concepts that figure in perceptual beliefs, <br>
for these attributes. The (iconic) perceptual attributives differ from both types of concep-<br>
tual attributive in that they do not constitutively contribute to <i>propositional</i>  structures or <br>
transformations. They are psychologically different representational competencies. It is a <br>
simple error to infer from there being a linguistic, hence conceptual, meaning that indi-<br>
cates an attribute to just any representation of the same attribute’s being conceptual.<br>
<br>
A third oversight is overlooking the fact that some of the attributives used in lin guis tic-<br>
al ly expressed categorizations in the experiments do not even indicate and attribute the <br>
same attributes that fastest categorizations, generated by dominantly feed-forward percep-<br>
tual processing, indicate and attribute. For reasons given earlier, natural kinds like <i>dog</i> <br>
(kinds that figure in some of the subjects’ judgments) are not indicated by any perceptual <br>
attributive. Perceptual categorizations (dog-body) can be expected to trigger natural-kind <br>
conceptual categorizations once perceptual processing interacts with linguistic or other <br>
conceptual capacities.<br>
<br>
Similar points apply to at least some of the categorizations of artifacts, perhaps <i>picnic</i>, <i>art <br>
supply</i>, <i>sport equipment</i>. If there are no perceptual attributives for such kinds, then percep-<br>
tual attributives for relevantly shaped bodies trigger conceptual attributives. I think that <br>
there are probably perceptual attributives for some functional kinds—very likely, <i>agent</i>, <br>
<i>mate</i>, <i>predator</i>, <i>food</i>, <i>prey—</i>probably many more, including learned, more specific func-<br>
tional kinds. Perhaps uses of simple artifacts can be perceptually learned through attribu-<br>
tion of action, then coded into perceptual anticipation of uses, which in turn affect the <br>
nature of perceptual content. These matters must be explored on a case-by-case basis. The <br>
more sophisticated and theoretically based the competencies required to differentiate a <br>
functional kind from its shape-or motion-specified counterpart, the less plausible it is that <br>
there is a perceptual attributive that indicates the relevant kind. X-ray machine seems wildly <br>
implausible, because tracking its function would require highly theoretical know ledge that <br>
could not be embedded <i>per se</i> in a perceptual system. Knife seems far less implausible.<br>
<br>
There is reason to believe that the triggering of conceptual categorizations by percep-<br>
tual categorizations is very fast. The triggering is non-inferential and largely based on sim-<br>
ple learned associations—for example, between a specifically shaped body and a natural <br>
kind, or a specifically shaped body and an artifact. Still, it is a transition from perceptual <br>
categorization, generated by the perceptual system, to conceptual categorization, gener-<br>
ated by associative interaction between perceptual capacities and conceptual capacities.<br>
<br>
In any case, the argument that I am criticizing is powerless to show that whatever fastest <br>
categorization underlies the Potter experiments is conceptual. There is evidence that lin-<br>
guistic meanings are not directly generated in processes that lead to fastest cat egor iza tions. <br>
First categorizations do not depend on language. (See Chapter 11.) Generation of linguis-<br>
tically mediated categorizations appears to be slightly slower in relevant cases than gen er-<br>
ation of non-linguistic perceptual categorizations.654 There is no ground to think that <br><br>
