If one perceives more than one particular via a perceptual state, must one apply differ-<br>
ent <i>accurate</i> discriminatory attributives for each different perceived particular? I think <br>
not. The argument for (AA2) does not require that each different perceived particular <br>
receive a different <i>accurate</i> attribution. By (AA1a), the perceptual state must make differ-<br>
ent attributions to the different perceived particulars. For example, if it is a perception of <br>
different bodies as bodies, it must perceive them as being in different places, or at least in <br>
different directions. It need not get the places or directions right. The places could be sys-<br>
tematically shifted in some way. Relations among the different perceived particulars might <br>
also be distorted in some systematic way.<br>
<br>
The fact that the different particulars cause different aspects of the perceptual state via <br>
different causal chains suffices to ground explanation of perception of different particulars <br>
with the same attribute. For example, one could account for the successful perceptual ref-<br>
erence to different particulars via different causal chains running into the perceptual state <br>
that derive from the different bodies, perceived as bodies, even though because of some <br>
external interference, the perceptual system is systematically misled about their positions <br>
in space and their spatial relations to one another. Attributions of <i>has a connected outer <br>
boundary</i> remain accurate, and conform to (AA2). The different causal chains must, how-<br>
ever, link with a successfully applied attributive (in each case), if picking out particulars at <br>
the ends of the causal chains is to be <i>perceptual</i>, not merely sensory-registrational. When <br>
any given entity is sensed, many more are sensed. For example, one senses the proximal <br>
stimulus as well as a distal stimulus through vision.<br>
<br>
In the example, I assumed that the bottom-line accurate, guiding attributives are <br>
generic—outer-boundary-connected shaped. Accuracy can be even more generic—shape, <br>
color, body, object. The accuracy must delimit in a one-place way. To perceive a particular, <br>
one need not get relations even approximately right.<br>
<br>
Correct attribution includes very generic characterizations. Of course, more specific <br>
characterizations can be accurate as well. For attributions to tropes, these are, however, <br>
often at best only approximately accurate. One could perceive a color-instance and not get <br>
its specific color right at any level. It is necessary for perceptual reference only that the <br>
system categorize the color trope as an instance of color. Some will think that such attribu-<br>
tion is too “abstract” for a perceptual system to engage in. This view tends to derive from <br>
traditional empiricist views that focus on images independently of their uses and func-<br>
tions, in trying to understand perception. The view is not grounded in thinking of percep-<br>
tual attributions as exercises of perceptual competencies. For more detail, see Chapter 4, <br>
the section Taxonomic Hierarchies in PercePtion.<br>
<br>
I re-emphasize that (AA2) is compatible with cases in which perception of a particular <br>
occurs despite inaccurate perceptual attributions. The cloud misperceived as a body, as <br>
having a specific shape, as moving, as being in such and such a position, and so on, exem-<br>
plified such a case. (AA2) just claims that successful perception of a particular—a percep-<br>
tual referential application’s having a <i>representatum</i>—requires at least one accurate <br>
perceptual attribution. The accurate attribution differentiates the perceived particular <br>
from other particulars of different types that cause the same aspect of the given perceptual <br>
state, but that are not perceived.<br>
<br>
The argument for (AA2) provides a rationale for the intuitive idea that it does not make <br>
sense to conceive a perceptual state that is a successful perception of a particular, but does <br>
not pick out the particular partly by way of determining one or more of its properties. The </div>
