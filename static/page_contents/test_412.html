provide <i>specific</i> explanations of formation of perceptual states that represent environmental <br>
subject matters. Such formation is the main topic of psychophysics.491<br>
<br>
For all that, neuro-science has made important contributions in associating neural <br>
states with psychological functions. For example, an area of the brain called MT (middle <br>
temporal cortex) has functions closely connected with visual perception of motion. V1 <br>
has functions closely associated with mapping the retinal image. Both areas, like all other <br>
major areas, have multiple functions. So the associations are never simple.<br>
<br>
One can also find patterns of neural firings in a given area that correlate systematically <br>
with distal stimuli of a given type, despite significant differences in proximal stimulation. <br>
By mapping not only the brain area that exhibits such correlations, but the timing of the <br>
firings, one can discover constraints on the temporal order of <i>perceptual</i> processing. For <br>
example, if a pattern of neural firing that correlates with a certain distal shape occurs in <br>
V1 after it occurs in a brain area, such as IT (infero-temporal cortex), that is known to <br>
receive its first stimuli after V1 first receives its stimuli, one can infer that whatever role V1 <br>
has in enabling representation of the global shape derives from processing that reverses <br>
the initial bottom-up direction. One can infer that whatever contribution to perception <br>
the neural activity in V1 makes comes later than the contribution made by the activity <br>
in IT. One also learns that V1 has more than one function in visual processing—both <br>
mapping areas of the retinal image and (later) participating in environmental shape <br>
representation.<br>
<br>
Further, by timing the first occurrence of a neural firing pattern (let us say, in IT) that <br>
correlates with a distal stimulus, one can infer an occurrence of a perceptual state involved <br>
in a perceptual constancy for the environmental attribute that is the distal stimulus. The <br>
interval in milliseconds from onset of proximal retinal stimulus to the neural pattern that <br>
underlies the representation of a given distal stimulus (such as a surface or an animal-<br>
body) is understood in a specific way. It is the interval at which correlation of the neural <br>
pattern with the distal stimulus is above chance. The shortest intervals cited are usually <br>
at-a-glance-type perceptions that are later filled in—so that the degree of correlation and <br>
the amount of detail available in a perceptual state grows as the time after initial stimulus <br>
increases. Whereas Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) has provided insights <br>
into function, Fast Field Echo (FFE) has illuminated timing.<br>
<br>
The exemplified conclusions fall well short of insight into specifics of perceptual-state <br>
formation. They do not yield formation laws. They do yield insight into the sequence of <br>
processing stages and into the time course of perceptual-state formation. They are among <br>
the main sources for the shift to a more complex picture than the one that prevailed until <br>
25 years ago.<br>
<br>
A further methodological point relevant to what follows is that, <i>within</i> psychophysics, <br>
there are important differences in the level of knowledge regarding different stages of <br>
perception-formation. Broadly speaking, earlier stages are better understood than later <br>
stages. Detailed, rigorous, and relatively stable accounts of the general computational form <br>
of processing that centers on the retinal image are available. Impressive accounts of the <br>
mechanisms that yield the simpler perceptual constancies—for example, depth, position, <br><br>
