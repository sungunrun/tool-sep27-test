attributives and PercePtual discrimination 147</div>
<br><br>
One can perhaps unconsciously perceptually discriminate more than one can con-<br>
sciously perceptually discriminate. It seems likely that unconscious perceptual dis crim in-<br>
ation underlies the conscious failures of transitivity in color discrimination that used to <br>
occupy philosophers.152 One cannot consciously discriminate color shades A and B, or B <br>
and C, or C and D. One can consciously discriminate shades A and D. The conscious dis-<br>
crim in ation is almost surely perceptual. A and B are surely discriminated unconsciously. <br>
The perceptual system is certainly capable of responding differently to them. If uncon-<br>
scious discrimination of A and B is embedded in color constancy—hence perception—, <br>
then more is unconsciously perceived than is consciously perceived in such cases. I con-<br>
jecture that the unconscious discrimination may well be perceptual.<br>
<br>
The number of perceptual attributives in a mammalian perceptual system is easily <br>
underestimated. I made this point with regard to color discrimination in Chapter 4. It <br>
applies quite widely. Perceiving an array of bars of visibly different lengths involves attrib-<br>
uting different length-attributives. Perceptual attribution of length is quite specific. <br>
Perception differentiates the bar lengths. Such differentiation could be made again and <br>
again. There is a standing competence to differentiate. Perceptual attributives just are <br>
standing perceptual competencies to represent repeatable types in the service of percep-<br>
tual reference. In perceiving different bar lengths, a system applies different perceptual <br>
attributives whose function is to discriminate the lengths.<br>
<br>
As I have indicated, all the specific attributions could be mistaken, and one could still <br>
perceive the different bar lengths if one applies a more generic category accurate of all of <br>
them, assuming that the different lengths are connected to different aspects of one’s percep-<br>
tion by different causal chains. One applies different attributives for the different bar lengths.<br>
<br>
I have heard well-known philosophers expostulate that it is implausible that one could <br>
have an attributive for each length of the various bars. Such expostulation derives from an <br>
un-thought-through conception of perceptual attributives. The conception probably <br>
derives from thinking of them as too much like words, which must be separately learned, <br>
rather than in terms of repeatable discriminatory perceptual competencies.<br>
<br>
If one thinks of perceptual attributives as standing competencies to perceptually dis-<br>
crim in ate by attributes, the resistance fades. We can perceptually discriminate over a mil-<br>
lion color shades. Those standing perceptual discriminative competencies are perceptual <br>
attributives. One has at least a million perceptual attributives for color shades. No arm-<br>
chair argument can show that we lack attributives for each discriminable color shade. <br>
Attributives are individuated partly in terms of what they attribute. We can attribute any <br>
color shade that we can perceptually discriminate. As noted, for each indicant—here, <br>
color shade or bar length—many perspectivally different perceptual attributives attribute <br>
it. The capacity to indicate a shade under one illumination differs from a capacity to indi-<br>
cate it under another. Similarly, a capacity to represent a bar length presented in one orien-<br>
ta tion (slant and tilt) differs from a capacity to represent it in another orientation. The <br>
perspectives or modes of presentation differ. So there are many more perceptual attribu-<br>
tives than there are <i>representata</i> (indicants). I develop the point in Chapters 7–9.<br>
<br>
It is <i>not</i> a requirement on perceptual attributives and perceptual discrimination that <br>
they differentiate a particular from all possible particulars, in all possible <br><br>
