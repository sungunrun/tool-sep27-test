604 Perceptual Memory: Short-Term Systems</div>
<br><br>
The view that word meanings are concepts accords with my understanding of concepts <br>
as ability-general representations that function to contribute to a propositional structure <br>
(also structure of propositional inference). Words express ability-general representations <br>
that function to contribute to a sentential, hence propositional, structure. The <i>perceptual</i> <br>
representations that Potter takes to be retained in CSTM are limited to representations for <br>
color, shape, and size.<br>
<br>
Potter states, as a further reason for counting CSTM a partly conceptual memory sys-<br>
tem, that the targets of recognition tested for short-term memory ‘are defined by meaning <br>
or category but vary in physical form’.932 Potter’s claim exhibits the tendency—criticized in <br>
Chapter 13, the section Perceptual Categorization is Perceptual—to take <br>
categorization as in itself conceptual, in a sense that makes it non-perceptual. In fact, per-<br>
ceptual categorization of generic bodies as well as animal-bodies and dog-bodies group <br>
instances that vary considerably in physical size and form.<br>
<br>
Such categorization is part of visual perceptual processing, using computationally only <br>
perceptual-level states and transitions. The visual system has substantial powers for group-<br>
ing and abstraction. Memory of such categorization is retention of perceptual representa-<br>
tion. Of course, there are normally conceptual categorizations that are counterparts to, in <br>
fact conceptualizations of, these perceptual categorizations—counterparts that indicate <br>
the same attributes.<br>
<br>
These observations bear on some of Potter’s interpretations of her experiments. She <br>
found that subjects can be distracted by decoys. Subjects watched a sequence of five <br>
 pictures, each presented for 173 ms. They were then shown a picture and asked to say <br>
whether it was in the just-presented sequence. Subjects were fairly successful. When they <br>
were shown pictures, after the sequence, that were similar in category but different in spe-<br>
cific shape, orientation, or size, subjects made more mistakes. For example, if a picture of a <br>
camel at mid-distance standing up was among the initially shown five pictures, and the <br>
decoy picture was of a camel up close, lying down, and facing in a different direction, <br>
subjects made more mistakes. Potter took the result to evince the presence of concepts in <br>
CSTM, because she assumed that any categorization must be conceptual.933<br>
<br>
To the contrary, such categorizations of bodies by shape are, quite normally, produced by <br>
the visual system—both with and without help from perceptual-level memory. (See Chapter 4, <br>
the section Taxonomic Hierarchies in Perception; and Chapter 13, the section <br>
Richer Perceptual Categorization and Perceptual Processing that <br>
Contributes to It.) Variations in distance, orientation, and visi bil ity of body-parts <br>
can certainly be handled by the visual system in a constancy for the relevant camel-body. <br>
Unusual orientations cause more misperceptions—weaker constancy—and more memory <br>
mistakes, because they fit less quickly into such antecedent structures as standard orienta-<br>
tion templates. Representation of shapes under such conditions is slower and less accurate <br>
than under more familiar conditions. Categorization of camel-bodies is certainly <br><br>
