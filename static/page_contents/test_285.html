need not do this. It could index the past time schematically, without a referential applica-<br>
tion to it. I discuss such a case in Chapter 6, the section Absence in Perception of <br>
Negations, Conditionals, Disjunctions, and Quantifiers and Chapter 17, <br>
the section Ability-General Long-Term Visual Perceptual Memory. <br>
Schematic representation can occur in any type of memory. It is probably most prevalent <br>
in long-term memory. Here I assume that the perception’s indexical reference to its pre-<br>
sent time lays down a file (f) that is specific to that time and is tracked in short-term per-<br>
ceptual memory. The memory indexically represents not only its present time, but also the <br>
present-indexed time of the perception—by a referential application (then that tf1). This <br>
application functions to refer anaphorically via the memory file back through the percep-<br>
tual state’s present-time indexical anchoring to the time of the past perception. This refer-<br>
ential application is identical with the visual state’s original one, although it is no longer an <br>
application of the nowego schematic competence. It depends entirely for its reference, <br>
 however, on that now-competence’s being exercised. It does not, of course, count as a <br>
perception-reference of the past time. It operates just as indexically as the original frame-<br>
work anchoring referential application, (nowego t1).<br>
<br>
The second conclusion that I draw from the example is that the initial perception and <br>
its memory could be veridical while the veridicality conditions of the use state and <i>its</i> <br>
concurrent perceptual state (if any) could fail to be veridical. Or vice-versa. For example, <br>
the initial perception and its memory could pick out certain particulars. But by the later <br>
moment when the use state and the second perception occur, those particulars could van-<br>
ish, and either be replaced by other particulars or be replaced by nothing, so that there are <br>
referential illusions in the latter pair of states. In either case, the contents would fail to be <br>
accurate, because of a failure of tracking. Obviously, the situations could be reversed.<br>
<br>
Let us step back from these two conclusions about the representational contents of the <br>
relevant psychological states. I summarize the two pieces of explanatory work that postu-<br>
lating memory and temporal representation do (must do, I think), in Gross’s case.<br>
<br>
One is to explain the psychological properties of the retention capacity that must be <br>
involved in preserving the perception’s content over time, for use. What aspects of the <br>
perceptual representation are retained in such memory? How long are they retained? <br>
What are their decay properties? What kinds of failure can the memory undergo? How <br>
accurate are retentions? Such questions about the retention of the perceptual state and <br>
about the content of the use state are elided in Gross’s description of his case. They need <br>
empirical answers. Explanation must postulate and investigate content retention—perceptual  <br>
memory.<br>
<br>
The other explanatory work is explaining how the difference in time bears on the states’ <br>
semantics, including the types of fallibility that the representational states have in relevant <br>
causal transactions. These include causal relations between guiding states and states that <br>
are guided, and that function to track what the guiding states represent. They also include <br>
causal relations between both types of states and particulars that they function to repre-<br>
sent. The guiding states (perception and perhaps memory) function to represent the distal <br>
stimuli that cause them. The use state functions to represent a present or future situation <br>
that it is to operate upon. The contemporaneous perceptual state, if any, functions to rep-<br>
resent the distal stimuli that cause it and that are later than the stimuli that cause the guid-<br>
ing states. The contemporaneous perceptual state also functions to guide further use states <br>
involved in implementing the initial use state.Is Temporal Representation Constitutive to Perception? 285</div>
