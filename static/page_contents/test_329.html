Since these properties are represented by different aspects of the perceptual state, and sev-<br>
eral derive from different, dissociable formation processes, remembering these properties <br>
to differing degrees occurs. Such occurrence bears not at all on a memory’s remaining <br>
iconic. Iconicity depends on there being one or more natural mappings, as explained at <br>
the chapter’s beginning. Even when memory of one property in a package is weaker than <br>
that of another property, there remain natural mappings from aspects of the memory state <br>
that represent the properties and the properties themselves.<br>
<br>
Normal visual perception represents its basic attributes in packages. Doing so is an <br>
aspect of the iconic nature of normal vision. It is a way in which visual perception is nor-<br>
mally picture-like or map-like. Neither perception nor iconicity is <i>essentially</i> picture-like <br>
or map-like <i>in this respect</i>. As noted, a visual perception and visual memory could be of a <br>
single unlocated color shade, with no packaging. They would remain iconic. Auditory per-<br>
ception is iconic but not at all picture-like. The etymology of ‘iconic’ is connected to visual <br>
imagery. Standard dictionary meanings of the term generalize beyond the visual.357 The <br>
connection between iconicity and pictures or maps is real and paradigmatic. It is not con-<br>
stitutive. What is constitutive is a natural mapping from some units of representation to <br>
entities in the subject matter.<br>
<br>
Let us return to the idea that because one can cut up a picture into parts each of which <br>
represents something, the semantics of a picture is arbitrary. It is sometimes, though not <br>
always, correct to think of pictures, maps, and perceptions as containing smallest repre-<br>
sentational parts—pixel-like representations. It is easy to infer, mistakenly, that the seman-<br>
tics of pictures has no structure. Even if a realist picture is built up from small, primitive, <br>
representational parts, it does not follow that the parts can be combined in arbitrary ways. <br>
Representation depends on usage. Usage never evinces or allows arbitrary combinations <br>
among representations.<br>
<br>
Presence of smallest, pixel-like representational parts in a picture, map, or perception <br>
does not imply that those parts are representationally primitive. Often the representational <br>
content of smallest parts depends on the representational content of larger wholes. In such <br>
cases, pixels need not be primitives. For example, a pixel may have an analog of the con-<br>
tent: part, in such and such a location, with such and such size and shape, with such and <br>
such color, of such and such surface. Such characterizations are consistent with a picture’s <br>
having compositional, representational structure. (Of course, this characterization is <br>
intended as the non-iconic, linguistic counterpart of an iconic characterization.) Such <br>
characterizations often correspond to what is fundamental psychologically. Small parts <br>
of an edge are often represented only <i>as</i>  such parts. So a representation’s being <br>
 analyzable into representations of small parts, where the representations occur in a <br>
part–whole structure that maps naturally into a part–whole structure in the <i>representata</i>, <br>
does <i>not</i> imply that the pixel-like representations of small parts are representationally <br>
primitive.<br>
<br>
For example, smallest useable/discernible iconic representations of very small parts of <br>
a line, which occur in maps, pictures, and visual perception, need not be, and usually <br>
are not, primitive representational units. They need not be basic building blocks for <br><br>
