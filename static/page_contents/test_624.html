representational content. Visual sensory memory is comparably rich, retaining for a short <br>
time nearly the full representational content, as a residue of a perception.<br>
<br>
Visual sensory memory is extended by fragile visual short-term memory (FVSTM) at a <br>
sparser, sketch-like level of detail. Trans-saccadic memory (TSM) retains a similarly <br>
sketch-like level of detail and functions to stabilize perception by carrying information <br>
across saccades.<br>
<br>
Visual working memory (VWM) retains an even sparser iconic level of detail than <br>
FVSTM. Retention in VWM is highly dependent on attention. Retention time can be <br>
extended indefinitely through rehearsal. Retention serves various occurrent operations, <br>
including cognitive operations. VWM lasts longer than visual sensory memory <br>
and FVSTM.<br>
<br>
“Conceptual” short-term memory (CSTM) retains substantially more perceptual detail <br>
than VWM or FVSTM. Retention time is shorter than VWM. Contents in CSTM are <br>
harder to access than those in VWM, usually requiring forced-choice tests rather than <br>
free recall.<br>
<br>
VWM, CSTM, and probably FVSTM, retain conceptual content that is associated with <br>
perceptual content. VWM and CSTM have dissociable “branches” that retain linguistic input.<br>
<br>
Underlying the retrievable aspects of these short-term memory systems are either <br>
unconscious counterparts or a single system of unconscious, hard-to-consciously-retrieve, <br>
memory. Visual long-term memory, VLTM, is fed both unconsciously and consciously. <br>
FVSTM, VWM, and CSTM are fed by visual sensory memory. How these types of short-<br>
term memory feed one another is a topic for research.<br>
<br>
Visual long-term perceptual memory is rich, though not photographic, in detail. It has <br>
a stupendous retention capacity. It comprises both generic and <i>de re</i> sub-species. One of <br>
the <i>de re</i> sub-species, episodic memory, provides the basis for autobiography gained from <br>
the inside—from the subject’s own perceptual experiences.<br>
<br>
All types of visual perceptual memory retain visual perceptual representational content. <br>
Insofar as they do, they represent at the perceptual level. They are not more complex in <br>
their operations and are not more knowledge-like than perception itself. In fact, their <br>
operations are mostly simpler than those involved in forming perceptions. Their evolu-<br>
tion, except perhaps in the case of episodic memory, is broadly contemporaneous with the <br>
evolution of visual perception.<br><br>
