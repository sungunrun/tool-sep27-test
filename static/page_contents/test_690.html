improve performance on the cited tasks. A perceptual shape-grouping is primed when a <br>
subject hears or reads a word. The subject thereby has local, transient anticipation of that <br>
shape grouping. Perhaps because the shape grouping has an entrenched association with <br>
the word, priming by the word is especially strong. There is evidence that the earliest <br>
effects of word priming prior to onset of visual proximal stimulus are on spatial process-<br>
ing. These effects show up as early as 44 ms after onset of visual proximal stimulus. (This <br>
stimulus post-dates the stimulus from the word label.)1133<br>
<br>
These results are interesting, but hardly revolutionary. Priming is a low-level effect. In <br>
some of these experiments, it is not clear that the word’s meaning plays any role in the <br>
priming. Words are certainly associated with past perceptions stored in perceptual mem-<br>
or ies, as well as with concepts. Memories of visual shape-representations associated with <br>
the word appear to do the main priming work. Even if the word’s meaning (the conceptual <br>
competence associated with it) plays a causal role in the priming, the meaning’s effect, <br>
through the priming, can be expected to depend on associations between perceptions and <br>
perceptual memories of the word’s shape or sound, on one hand, and those perceptual <br>
representations that are primed, on the other. (Of course, a word’s perceived shape or <br>
sound is perceptually grouped in ways that can depend on the word’s use and meaning.) <br>
Computational explanations center on these latter associations, which are perceptual-<br>
level. Cognitive causal antecedents to these associations are not cited in computational <br>
explanations. The case is not fundamentally different from the way instructions prime <br>
sensori-perceptual structures through attentional perceptual selection.<br>
<br>
I turn to a second specification of a relation of penetration. Steven Gross’s explication is <br>
unusual in being charitable and constructive about Pylyshyn’s vague remarks. Gross <br>
defends cognitive impenetrability in a specific case. He argues that cognitively guided <br>
<i>attention</i> does not penetrate <i>early visual processing</i>. This is a very limited project.<br>
<br>
Gross advances two ideas on penetration. One is directness of access. The other is <br>
semantic coherence. Directness of access is explicated as follows:<br><br>
. . . early vision must itself have “access” to the cognitive states. The cognitive states must <br>
<br>
exert their influence because early vision’s computations take their contents into account <br>
<br>
<i>by operating over them</i> [my italics], not just because the cognitive states have effects on <br>
<br>
<i>other</i> states over which early vision computes. In this sense, the influence must be <i>direct</i>.1134<br><br>
This explication comes close to Fodor’s emphasis on inclusion in computational op er-<br>
ations—his “second way”. In applications of this explication, Gross does not consistently <br>
exploit the idea of computational operation on a state’s content (and mode). Some of his <br>
reasoning, in the section of his article titled ‘An Alternative Defense of Pylyshyn’s Claim’, <br><br>

fpsyg.2017.00221 (the section ‘Attention and Cognitive Penetration in Pylyshyn’s Sense’). I have not found any <br>
passage in which Pylyshyn <i>clearly</i>  explicates directness of access in terms of computational operations on the <br>
contents of states (or on vehicles expressing such contents), although the idea may well have been in the back of <br>
his mind. Fodor’s “second way”, discussed above, constitutes such an explication. Gross does not mention Fodor <br>
in this context.<br>
Although Gross specifies only contents, any reasonable account would have to allow computations to take <br>
account of a state’s mode as well. For example, inasmuch as visual computations operate on memory or on pro-<br>
prioceptive feedback, such as corollary discharge, they have to take account of the mode of the content.</div>
