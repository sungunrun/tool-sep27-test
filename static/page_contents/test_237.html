<b>Linkage of Different Perceptual Attributives in Perceptual Constancies<br><br>
</div>
</b>A central theme of this chapter has been that there are two aspects of perceptual at tribu-<br>
tives for a given attribute in a perceptual constancy. Different perceptual attributives apply <br>
to the same attribute. Yet the sameness of attribute indication and attribution, within a <br>
perceptual constancy, is coded into the attributive—into the relevant perceptual compe-<br>
tence. Difference and sameness must both be marked in the semantics. So far, I have <br>
focused mostly on difference.<br>
<br>
I introduce a term for the relation among different, basic perceptual attributives each of <br>
which indicates and attributes the attribute on which the constancy centers, within a percep-<br>
tual constancy. I say that such perceptual attributives are ‘<i>linked</i> ’ to one another. If I perceive <br>
a surface as having a specific rectangular shape from straight on, I have one perceptual <br>
attributive that indicates and attributes that specific rectangular shape. If I veridically per-<br>
ceive a surface as having the same specific rectangular shape, but from a different angle, <br>
I have another perceptual attributive that indicates and attributes the same specific rectangu-<br>
lar shape. The two attributives are <i>linked</i> to one another. They are linked to all other at tribu-<br>
tives for that specific rectangular shape that could be exercised by the same perceptual <br>
constancy in the same perceptual system. They are linked in a single capacity to attribute the <br>
constant attribute. Linkage does not consist in occurrently connecting occurrent exercises of <br>
the ability. Linkage is ability-general. It consists in the system’s competence to exercise differ-<br>
ent attributive capacities in indicating and attributing an attribute-type. At bottom, this link-<br>
age is a single perceptual capacity to indicate and at tri bute a given attribute in different ways, <br>
through different sub-capacities, each of which is a specific attributive capacity.<br>
<br>
Perceptual constancies are capacities or competencies. They are competencies to prod-<br>
uce a variety of perceptual states, each of which attributes a given “constant” attribute <br>
under a different stimulus condition. Perceptual attributives in perceptual states are <i>linked</i> <br>
with respect to a constant attribute, if (a) they are all components of representational con-<br>
tents of perceptual states that are or could be exercised in a given perceptual constancy <br>
and (b) they all attribute the constant attribute.<br>
<br>
Exercises of perceptual constancies are mostly approximately accurate in representing a <br>
single attribute. I center on the ideal case of full accuracy. Understanding <i>exercises</i> of com-<br>
petencies to accurately represent must allow for failures. Near-miss failures are common.<br>
<br>
Linked perceptual attributives are linked not only through their all having the same <br>
indicant, but also by corresponding law-like relations between the different perspectives <br>
they mark. The different perspectives derive from different stimulus conditions.<br>
<br>
Let us consider some semantical aspects of such linkings. I emphasize differences <br>
between perceptual attributives and <i>conceptual</i> attributives, especially those expressed in <br>
language.<br>
<br>
An important feature of linked perceptual attributives is that all indicate and attribute <br>
the same attribute, <i>and do so as a consequence of their representational contents</i>, even <br>
though they are different attributives. Attributive representational contents are competen-<br>
cies. Linked perceptual attributives represent a given edge length as a consequence of their <br>
representational content. Different iconic perceptual attributives for the same length differ <br>
in representing it, in a spatial coordinate system, as at different distances, orientations, and <br>
so on. Here we have an analog to representation of a length via different distance and <br>
orien ta tion plottings in a picture.</div>
