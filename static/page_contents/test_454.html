454 Primitive Attribution of Causation, Agency</div>

visuomotor interactions are taken by some to count against the impression’s being based on <br>
propositional belief.584 There is widespread agreement that the causal impression is processed <br>
and produced at a lower level in individuals’ psychologies than the level of controlled thinking.<br>
<br>
Michotte’s hypothesis was, however, more specific. He maintained not only that primi-<br>
tive causal representation is independent of and more automatic than normal individual-<br>
level inductive inference. He maintained that the causal impression is specifically a product <br>
of the visual system. In Michotte’s work and in much subsequent work, it is not always <br>
clear what it takes to show that a representation is generated in the visual system. There is <br>
a broad use of the phrase ‘perception of causation’ that applies both to the view that primi-<br>
tive representation of causation resides in visual systems and to the view that it is a prod-<br>
uct of visual representation of motion configurations <i>together with</i> a concept for causation, <br>
both generated in fast, unconscious, non-inferential ways.<br>
<br>
Being generated in fast, automatic, unconscious, uncontrolled, un-inferred ways simply <br>
does not distinguish perceptual states from conceptual-propositional states. Perceptual <br>
beliefs are so generated. (See Chapter 6, the section Perceptual Contents, <br>
Propositions, and Noun Phrases.)<br>
<br>
Our issue is whether primitive representation of mechanical causation is a product of <br>
the visual system. The issue turns partly on what it is to be a product of the visual system.<br>
<br>
Hypotheses that maintain that primitive representation of mechanical causation is <br>
post-perceptual need not revert to the claim that causal impressions consist in aspects of <br>
causal beliefs, formed by individual-level inferences. The beliefs or belief-inclinations may <br>
be automatically and unconsciously formed, and not via propositional inference. Or they <br>
may be representations below the level of propositional attitudes, but above the level of <br>
perception. On either view, causal representations are like perceptual representations in <br>
that there is a disposition to form them even if there is background knowledge that leads <br>
to their being rejected as illusory. The impression and inclination to commit to causal <br>
attribution could remain even after such rejection. Like perceptions, they are formed fast <br>
and automatically. Yet, on these rival hypotheses, the causal representations are not formed <br>
in a perceptual system—are not perceptual attributives.<br>
<br>
I sketch two versions of this rival approach.<br>
<br>
On one, primitive cognitive representation of mechanical causation resides in core cog-<br>
nition. Core cognition takes input from one or more perceptual modalities. Its representa-<br>
tions are iconic, amodal, non-propositional, and supra-perceptual.585<br>
<br>
A second version maintains that primitive causal representations are products of gen-<br>
eral, non-perceptual learning mechanisms or non-perceptual mechanisms specialized to <br>
causation.586 This version tends to be associated with anti-innatist learning theory.<br>
<br>
Much of Michotte’s and followers’ evidence is not specific enough to support Michotte’s <br>
hypothesis that primitive representation of mechanical causation is perceptual over <br><br>
