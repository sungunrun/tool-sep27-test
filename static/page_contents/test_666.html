perception in being more removed from the here-and-now.<br>

First, a common usage in philosophical and scientific discourse identifies ‘cognition’ <br>
with “top-down” feedback.1086 Recall that scientific accounts of visual processing in the last <br>
few decades have changed. They highlight recurrent and horizontal processing as comple-<br>
mentary to feed-forward processing. Feed-forward processing begins with retinal stimula-<br>
tion. Registration of the retinal image undergoes processing already in the eye itself. The <br>
signal passes out of the eye through many stages—associated, for example, with lateral <br>
geniculate nucleus (LGN), V1, medial temporal cortex (MT)/V5, V2, V3, V4, infero-<br>
temporal cortex (IT), and beyond. Current science recognizes multi-directional process-<br>
ing in perception-formation. As outlined in Chapter 11, feedback occurs at all stages of <br>
visual processing. Feed-forward processing, supplemented by horizontal feedback, is <br>
dominant early. Recurrent processing, including from relatively distant areas, becomes co-<br>
equal or dominant after about 150 ms from retinal stimulus onset. Top-down processing is <br>
usually taken to be any type of feedback. So on this usage, the visual system is affected by <br>
cognition from the beginning of its processing (if feedback includes horizontal process-<br>
ing), and at latest by 120 ms (if feedback includes only recurrent processing). It is dom in-<br>
ated by cognition after 150 ms from stimulus onset.<br>
<br>
Several reasons count against identifying cognition with “top-down” processing. First, <br>
‘top-down’ is a misnomer, as it is commonly used. Little of the feedback comes from any <br>
well-delineated <i>top</i> of a processing hierarchy. Often, ‘top-down’ applies, in a more restricted <br>
way, to feedback from frontal and parietal areas.1087 These are large, multi-functional areas <br>
of the brain. They do not define a clear top, and do not even mark a type of processing <br>
function in feedback.<br>
<br>
The term ‘top-down’ is sometimes applied even to recurrent feedback from visual areas, <br>
including early visual areas. For example, feedback associated with V2 to processes sup-<br>
ported by V1, or MT to V1, or from V4 to V1, or IT to V4 is often called ‘top-down’.1088<br><br>
