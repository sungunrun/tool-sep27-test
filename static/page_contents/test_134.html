134 PercePtual reference requires PercePtual attribution</div>
<br><br>
(AA2) does not require that perceptual attributives discriminate a perceived particular <br>
from all other particulars, even all other perceived particulars. In being discriminatory a <br>
perceptual attributive perceptually discriminates a particular from at least some other <br>
particulars.<br>
<br>
The intuitive idea behind (AA1) is that to be a perceptual state, capable of accuracy and <br>
inaccuracy, the state must exercise standing, repeatable, perceptual competencies to <br>
respond to instances of <i>specific</i> environmental types. These competencies are perceptual <br>
attributives. They function to represent particulars as being instances of specific types.<br>
<br>
The intuitive idea behind (AA2) is that <i>successful</i> perception of a particular, hence any <br>
misperception of <i>it</i> as having certain attributes, depends on singling it out from other <br>
causal factors in the scene. Other causal factors usually include the background of the <br>
perceived entity and its perceived parts. They <i>always</i> include unperceived causes—light <br>
arrays at various distances stemming from perceived causes, aggregates of particles that <br>
make up perceived entities, internal causes, and so on. Since there are always unseen <br>
causes, causal chains cannot do all the work. The perceptual competence must dis crim in-<br>
ate the perceived cause or causes. Perceptually singling out a particular depends partly on <br>
exercising a standing, repeatable, perceptual competence to discriminate it from instances <br>
of some other types. In being an exercise of a standing, repeatable, perceptual competence, <br>
the discrimination must be able to operate on instances of the same types on other occa-<br>
sions. The competence is not individuated by any specific exercise of it. It is a repeatable, <br>
ability-general competence in that sense. It is a competence to discriminate instances by <br>
their types—an attributive competence. If the competence did not get something right <br>
about the type of instance that it singles out, it could not single it out. For there are many <br>
types of causes of the singling out. Singling out a perceived cause requires correctly char-<br>
acterizing it in some way.<br>
<br>
Picking out or singling out is always a joint enterprise—a veridical guiding attribu-<br>
tion—the exercise of a perceptual capacity—combined with that exercise’s being a <br>
response to a causal chain that leads back to a singled-out particular.<br><br>

<b>Support for (AA1)<br><br>
</div>
</b>I discuss and argue for (AA1) first.140<br>
<br>
(AA1) holds that in perception there is no exercise of a referential competence (the <br>
picking-out aspect of perception) without an exercise of an attributional competence (the <br>
characterizing aspect of perception).<br>
<br>
I think that this idea is natural. The idea that a perceptual state could consist of a bare, <br>
demonstrative-like referential application resists common sense. It is completely unclear what <br>
it would be to have a perception as of something <i>neat</i>—without characterizing anything in <br>
any way. In language we can use a demonstrative ‘that’ without overtly using any qualifier. <br>
Even in such cases, some unspoken qualifier is always in play, if ‘that’ is used to attempt to refer <br>
to something. Whatever the situation in language may be, (AA1) holds for perception.<br><br>
