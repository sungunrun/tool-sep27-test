contour registration and contour perception 87</div>
<br><br>
Perceptual science <i>does</i> distinguish perceptual constancies from other invariances. Here <br>
is a standard articulation of the idea:<br><br>
. . . constancy provides the single most crucial landmark in visual processing. It is the set <br>
<br>
of visual operations whose presumed job it is to convert visual representations that <br>
<br>
encode image-based (retina-based) features into ones that encode environment-based <br>
<br>
(object-based) features.81<br><br>
In every case of mainstream psychophysical explanation of the formation of states embed-<br>
ded in a perceptual constancy, there is a changeover from specification of states in terms of <br>
their relation to the proximal stimulus (the retinal image) to specification of states in <br>
terms of their representing some environmental feature—states that are understood to be <br>
inaccurate if they do not constitute representation of something that in fact has that fea-<br>
ture. The process that makes this changeover possible is objectification. In the case that we <br>
are tracking, the science treats contour groupings as operations that register features in <br>
retinal images. It does not take such groupings as perceptions as of environmental con-<br>
tours. The science should be taken on its own terms, absent powerful empirical reasons <br>
not to do so. I assume that the standard view in the science is right. I assume that off-the-<br>
cuff reductionism is wrong. I want to understand why.<br>
<br>
The reductionist view challenges us to understand key distinctions. It challenges us to <br>
better understand the distinctions between non-perceptual sensing and perception, and <br>
between processes and invariances that do not yield or constitute perceptual constancies <br>
and those that do. It challenges us to better understand the distinction between represen-<br>
tation, in a sense that is distinctive of psychology, and “representation”, in the sense of <br>
information registration.<br>
<br>
Why does the science causally explain the four specified operations as bearing on <br>
aspects of the retinal image, and not to represent the environment? Why does the science <br>
not take the operations to be exercises of perceptual constancies? Why does it not take the <br>
products of these operations to be perceptions as of edge segments and contours in the <br>
distal environment?<br>
<br>
Answers to these questions are not normally articulated in the science. However, they <br>
are, fairly clear. Postulating computations that form registrations of contours in the retinal <br>
image explains the operations of the visual system and perceivers’ performances quite <br>
well, without counting the operations as exercises of perceptual constancies—as represen-<br>
tations of physical contours of distal, environmental shapes. No illumination in causal <br>
explanation is gained by individuating the sensory registrations partly in terms of distal <br>
environmental attributes. There is no need to appeal to a process of objectification. All the <br>
transformations lead to increasingly abstract groupings of the proximal stimulus—the <br>
retinal image. So the science does not take these operations to be exercises of perceptual <br>
constancies.<br>
<br>
The deeper point is that the operations bear a clear causal relevance to contours in the <br>
retinal image and vastly less relevance to contours in the distal environment. Here we have <br>
a concrete case of lack of objectification. The operation does not separate registrations <br><br>
