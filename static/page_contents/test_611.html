visual working memory <i>can</i> be actively maintained through rehearsal, not all VWM is <br>
actively maintained, much less actively stored or retrieved. (See Chapter 16, the section <br>
Visual Working Memory.)<br>
<br>
As we have seen, VWM encodes content both passively and actively. Encoding does not <br>
require attention. Encoding in VWM is unconsciously affected by content stored in long-<br>
term memory. Encoding into VLTM can be deliberate—a product of active attentive <br>
rehearsal in VWM. Or it can be unconscious, passive, and unattended.950 Storage in VWM <br>
can be active and deliberate. Or it can be promoted non-actively through priming. <br>
Retrieval in VLTM can also be triggered non-actively or produced actively. I think that <br>
distinguishing between VWM and VLTM by counting one active and the other passive <br>
produces confusion rather than insight.<br>
<br>
A second feature of the initial characterization is that it takes retention of <i>representation</i> <br>
to be a necessary condition on VLTM, as it is on my characterization of memory in gen-<br>
eral, set out at the beginning of Chapter 16. This aspect of the characterization is, in a <br>
sense, merely terminological. There is certainly long-term, non-representational, sensory <br>
retention. The characterization is motivated by wanting to focus on retention of represen-<br>
tational content.<br>
<br>
A controversial, but prominent theory is that there is a difference in kind between two <br>
aspects of VLTM’s contribution to recognition through visual perception. One is termed <br>
‘<i>recollection</i>’. The other, ‘<i>familiarity</i>’. Familiarity is prominent when one has a sense of hav-<br>
ing seen someone before, without being able consciously to remember any specific infor-<br>
mation about the person. Recollection is consciously remembering specific attributes <br>
about an entity. A prominent theory holds that these phenomena are distinct, dissociable <br>
retention processes. Familiarity is a fast process that reflects a purely quantitative signal <br>
that marks the strength or weakness of the sense of past interaction. It is the more primi-<br>
tive capacity, figuring in non-representational senses of danger and safety in animals. <br>
Recollection is a slower process that serves up specific attributive information.951<br>
<br>
Recollection is clearly memory. Whether familiarity is memory, in my sense, depends <br>
on whether it involves unconscious retention of perceptual representation. I think that it <br>
need not.<br>
<br>
Alan Baddeley postulated that some perceptual information passes into long-term <br>
memory that is not accessible to introspective consciousness, without passing through <br>
working memory. This postulation is surely correct.952 A similar point applies to contents <br>
of CSTM. Aspects of that type of memory have their subterranean long-term representa-<br>
tional effects.<br>
<br>
The role of unconscious feeding of memory has until recently been underestimated in <br>
the field. In fact, for many years it was thought that perceptual representation could not <br>
even get into long-term memory unless it was aided by conscious attention. Conscious <br>
working memory was regarded by some as the sole feeder of long-term perceptual mem-<br>
ory. However, it is clear that there are richer inputs into long-term memory from <br><br>
