Perception as Objectification 51</div>

non-perspectival.43 Second, and more importantly, it is the product of objectification. <br>
<i>Objectification</i> is formation of a state with a representational content that is as of an ob ject-<br>
ive subject matter by processes that separate the aspects of the state that cue the objective <br>
subject matter from aspects of the state that mainly bear on idiosyncratic, proximal, or <br>
subjective aspects of the individual. The relevant subject matter in visual perception is the <br>
macro-physical environment.<br>
<br>
I think that the basic points that I have made so far about the sensory, representational, <br>
and objective nature of perception are apriori. The specific form that objectification takes <br>
in actual animals is knowable only empirically. To explain such forms with some degree of <br>
concreteness, we need to sketch some basic features of perceptual psychology.<br>
<br>
The central problem of perceptual psychology is to state laws that ground explanation <br>
of how individuals perceive the world accurately when they do so, and how they fall into <br>
perceptual illusions when they do so. Solving this problem requires solving what the sci-<br>
ence calls ‘the <i>under­ determination</i> <i>problem</i>’. The problem can be characterized for visual <br>
perception as follows.<br>
<br>
Whereas the subject matter of visual perception is made up of particulars and their <br>
attributes in the distal environment, the initial states of the perceptual system are not per-<br>
ceptual states. They are sensory information registrations of proximal stimulation. The <br>
initial registration is primarily of an array of light striking the retina. Such registration is <br>
not perception. Yet, to a rough approximation, it is all that the visual system has to go on.44 <br>
Different environmental conditions can produce indiscriminable sensory information <br>
registrations. So registrations of proximal stimulations, together with the laws of physics <br>
(mainly optics) do not determine the environmental distal causes—the represented <br>
en tities. That is one type of under-determination: an under-determination of subject mat-<br>
ter by registration of proximal stimulation.<br>
<br>
There is a second type of under-determination. In the abstract, any given registrations <br>
of proximal stimulation are compatible with numerous types of perceptual states. The <br>
re gis tra tions of proximal stimulation under-determine perceptual states that represent, <br>
accurately or inaccurately, the environmental, causal antecedents of the proximal stimula-<br>
tion. That is, the initial registrations of proximal stimuli together with all laws except psy-<br>
cho logic al laws, do not fix the psychological states formed from the proximal stimuli. The <br>
second type of under-determination is an under-determination of perceptual states by <br>
registration of proximal stimulation.<br>
<br>
The <i>under­ determination problem</i> can be summarized in this question: How are percep-<br>
tual states that represent the environment formed, given that a perceptual system can <br>
only access proximal stimulation, and given that this access—together with all the <br><br>

<b>FOOTNOTES</b><br>
<b>Cont FN</b>43 Most of the subject matter of perception is mind-independent. Color may be an exception, in a sense. Some <br>
philosophers think that color is mind-dependent, in the sense of being constitutively dependent on a disposition <br>
in surfaces to cause certain sensations in minds. If that is so, color is still non-perspectival. The disposition of <br>
an object to cause certain sensations does not depend on any mind’s representational perspective on the color. <br>
I doubt this philosophical view of color. Because I do not want to enter into this dispute, I allow for the view. <br>
The discussion of objectivity here derives from Burge, <i>Origins of Objectivity</i>, 396–416, and Burge, ‘Origins of <br>
Perception’, 5–15. The allowance derives from discussion with Christopher Peacocke.<br>
<br>
44 This is a rough approximation because visual perception takes in proximal stimulation from other mo dal-<br>
ities–for example, proprioceptive and auditory modalities. The under-determination problem applies to the <br>
whole range of proximal stimulation on which any given perception depends for its formation.</div>
