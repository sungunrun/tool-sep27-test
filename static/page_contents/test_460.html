460 Primitive Attribution of Causation, Agency</div>

. . . the evidence is quite strong against Michotte’s hypothesis concerning the nature of that <br>
<br>
mechanism [the mechanism for computing causal representation from perceptual input]. <br>
<br>
That is, the data reviewed . . . militate against Michottian perceptual analyzers as <i>the</i> source <br>
<br>
of the human capacity for causal representations. If this were so, there should be a point <br>
<br>
in development at which we could find evidence for causal perception in fully vis ible <br>
<br>
launching or entraining events . . ., and no evidence for causal inference, especially infer-<br>
<br>
ences integrating mechanical causality with other types of causal representations. No <br>
<br>
such point in development has been discovered yet; rather just the opposite is true. As <br>
<br>
soon as there is any evidence for causal representations, infants integrate their representa-<br>
<br>
tions of the spatio-temporal parameters of events with information about the onto logic al <br>
<br>
status and stable causal dispositions of the interacting entities.598<br><br>
These passages target more than one Michottian view. The targets should be distin-<br>
guished, The Michotte tradition assumed that only spatio-temporal features of immediate <br>
interactions between objects are determinative for forming primitive causal representa-<br>
tions. It also assumed that such causal representations constitute the single origin of all <br>
causal representation. Other scientists had already shown that many contextual effects, <br>
other than the spatio-temporal features of the interacting objects, bear on primitive causal <br>
representation of mechanical causation. The foregoing experiments show that the kinds of <br>
the interacting entities remembered from earlier experience figure in whether causal rep-<br>
resentations are formed. They also suggest that the most primitive representations of <br>
mechanical causation are computed on the basis of various cues, including cues about <br>
whether candidates for interaction are inert or self-moving. The argument hits these tar-<br>
gets. The target that concerns us, however, is the view that primitive representation of <br>
mechanical causation occurs in the visual system.599<br>
<br>
Here is the gist of the argument. To apply representation of causation as they do in these <br>
experiments, infants must make inferences to representations of unperceived situations. <br>
The inferences integrate antecedent information, obtained before a candidate causal event <br>
is perceived, about the natures of the candidate cause and candidate effect. The inferences <br>
integrate information about whether the relevant objects are inert or self-movers. Such <br>
integration tells against taking a perceptual system to be the source of causal representa-<br>
tion. The evidence indicates that in addition to perceptual representation there is causal <br>
inference that integrates mechanical causation with causation distinctive of self-movers. If <br>
primitive representation of mechanical causation were the product of a perceptual system, <br>
there would be a stage at which such representation is computed in the perceptual system, <br>
without utilizing supra-perceptual inference to unperceived situations and without being <br>
integrated with remembered information about whether an object is inert or a self-mover. <br>
There is no evidence of such a stage. So there is evidence against Michotte’s hypothesis that <br>
primitive representation of mechanical causation derives from a perceptual system.<br>
<br>
This second argument has no more force than the first. The main difficulty is the same. <br>
The contrast between perceptual representation and “inference” is not well grounded. <br>
Perception is inevitably integrated with perceptual memories and perceptual anticipations <br><br>
