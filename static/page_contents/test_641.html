course, correction of error does figure in perceptual and motor processing. However, pre-<br>
dictive coding theories have not shown that it as pervasive as they postulate. They have <br>
done literally nothing to show anything wrong with the prevailing types of explanation of <br>
visual processing, none of which postulate a pervasive cascade of error-detecting states. In <br>
fact, there is strong reason to believe that the effect of error correction is achieved in less <br>
elaborate ways than by the supposed cascade of omni-present checkers and correctors.1023 <br>
Little evidence has been adduced to show that predictive-coding  models explain specific <br>
types of perceptual processing better than mainstream theories. The movement is so far <br>
long on excitement, and short on evidence-based success. Whether it gains scientific <br>
weight is, of course, an empirical matter. It is well to remember that all-purpose, silver-<br>
bullet solutions to scientific problems as complex as perceptual processing have a poor <br>
track record.<br><br>

<b>Perceptual Imagining<br><br>
</div>
</b>I take perceptual imagining to include perceptual dreaming, perceptual day-dreaming, <br>
and perceptual imagery whether endogenously controlled or not. I do not include images <br>
in visual sensory memory that are immediate. natural residues of perception. (See <br>
Chapter 16, the section Visual Sensory Memory.) Images may arise in imagination <br>
from any memory, and may or may not be altered there. Imagining differs from memory <br>
not necessarily in its contents, but in its representational function. Unlike memory, per-<br>
ception, and anticipatory representation, imagining is non-committal. It does not realize <br>
or fail to realize any representational function by being either inaccurate or accurate. An <br>
imagining’s being inaccurate is not in itself a representational failure. When imagining <br>
uses only perceptual attributives, it is <i>perceptual imagining</i>.<br>
<br>
Dreaming in visual form is an exercise of the imagination that may have only practical <br>
functions. Endogenously controlled visual imagining can have functions of play, represen-<br>
tational expansion, or catharsis. There is evidence for imaginative functions, in both rest <br>
and sleep, in some non-human animals, such as rats.1024<br>
<br>
Some imagining refers to actual entities. Humans and probably apes and cats can dream <br>
about their mothers. Much imagining has unapplied schematic contents or referential <br>
applications that do not refer to any particular. Then properties are indicated, but no par-<br>
ticulars are referred to.<br>
<br>
Mental imagery became a central topic in psychology in 1971 when Roger Shepard and <br>
Jacqueline Metzler reported experiments that they proposed to explain in terms of mental <br>
rotation of visual images.1025 These experiments were milestones in the fall of behaviorism <br><br>
