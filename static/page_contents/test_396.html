primates. There is probably an innate basis for this fact. Distinguishing familiar from <br>
un famil iar faces fast can be critical to survival. However, there is evidence that mech an-<br>
isms that allow face identification under brief exposures and in the absence, or near <br>
absence, of attention hold for any category that is either of great importance to the species <br>
or of acquired familiarity in an individual.457<br>
<br>
These experiments were run under conditions in which, on usual operational under-<br>
standings of attention, attention was either absent or as nearly absent as experiment can <br>
currently show. The point applies to both endogenous and exogenous, “grabbed”, attention. <br>
Attention seems not to be necessary for these perceptual successes.<br>
<br>
Multiple objects can be reliably perceived in sufficiently separated locations—all while <br>
attention is distracted by another task. Reliable perception in these conditions occurs for <br>
entirely unfamiliar scenes. The gist of a spatially ordered, complex scene can be accurately <br>
and reliably perceived very rapidly. Previous familiarity and training are not necessary.<br>
<br>
The demonstrations of categorization in the absence or near absence of attention were <br>
presented in opposition to Treisman’s view of binding. In 2005 Evans and Treisman replied <br>
to some of this research, centrally a paper by Li, VanRullen, Koch, and Perona (2002).458<br>
<br>
Evans and Treisman proposed that subjects were not perceptually categorizing; they <br>
were perceiving low-level features that were reliable cues to the category. In post-perceptual <br>
cognition, they were inferring the category from these cues. For example, birds have beaks <br>
and wings. Mammals do not. One could infer presence of a bird-body from perceiving the <br>
shapes of beaks or wings, without having to <i>perceptually</i> attribute the shape of an animal <br>
or the shape of a bird.<br>
<br>
What is at issue is whether perceptual systems mobilize, under very short stimulus <br>
exposures, body and shape attributives that group, so as roughly to match the kinds that <br>
we think of as natural kinds—such as <i>dog</i>, <i>bird</i>, <i>mammal</i>, <i>animal</i>. Evans and Treisman <br>
proposed that they do not. They suggested that, under very short exposures, perceptual <br>
systems attribute only less global shapes, such as beak shapes, than shapes of whole ani-<br>
mals. Subjects then infer presence of whole animals from these less global shape cues, well <br>
after the initial perceptual representations, and report such presence. This suggestion <br>
functioned to save the theory that perceptual binding of low-level features into a high-<br>
level representation as of a body or bodily shape requires attention.<br>
<br>
Evans and Treisman rejected the view that whole-body-shapes are ever elementary fea-<br>
tures. They cited three grounds. First, they claimed that processing the global shape was <br>
much more complex than processing component shapes. Second, they held that there are <br>
fewer features than objects, and many are shared within categories. So the visual system <br>
can economize by using features to ground category attributions. Third, they stated that <br>
there was little neural evidence for whole object detectors, other than face detectors, at <br>
levels up to the infero-temporal cortex.459<br>
<br>
These grounds, and Evans and Treisman’s basic proposal—that only low-level, <br>
 pre-body-shape, and pre-categorizational properties are pre-attentively represented—have <br><br>
