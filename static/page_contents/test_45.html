All attributive competencies have two sub-competencies. In perception, these sub-<br>
competencies are always exercised together. One is to represent (I say, <i>indicate</i>) an <i>at tri­<br>
bute</i>—a property, relation, or kind. The other is to <i>attribute</i> that attribute to a particular or <br>
particulars. Indication is the type of connection to a <i>representatum</i> established by an <br>
attributive (as distinct from being established by a referential application). It is the compe-<br>
tence to respond representationally, in a repeatable way, to a repeatable type in the en vir-<br>
on ment mentioned in the previous paragraph. A non-activated competence to attribute <br>
an attribute indicates the attribute, but makes no attribution. In perception, attributives <br>
make attributions only when referential applications are stimulated to apply them attribu-<br>
tively—to exercise the attributive sub-competence.<br>
<br>
Perceptual attribution functions to characterize a particular as instantiating the indi-<br>
cated <i>representatum</i>. A perceptual attributive characterizes particulars as instantiating <br>
general, repeatable types, or as occurring in general, repeatable relations. The competence <br>
to connect to repeatable environmental types—indication—is always linked to a compe-<br>
tence to use that connection to characterize particulars—to connect the indicated type to <br>
them. This second competence is the one, mentioned two paragraphs back, to connect <br>
repeatable environmental types to particulars that instantiate them. The second, charac-<br>
terizing competence is attribution. Perceptual attributives are competencies to indicate an <br>
environmental type and to connect that type to instances or relata. The representational <br>
competencies that perceptual attributives constitute have corresponding representational <br>
functions—functions to indicate attributes (repeatable environmental types) and, when <br>
associated with sensory stimuli, to attribute them to perceived particulars.<br>
<br>
For example, a visual perception might represent a particular as a surface, as rectangu-<br>
lar, as red, and as being in a given location with respect to the viewer’s position. Then the <br>
visual perception picks out the particular and attributes to it the indicated attributes—<br>
being a surface<i>,</i> being rectangular, being red, and being at such and such distance in such <br>
and such direction, relative to the viewer’s position. Viewer position is specified with a <br>
referential application of the schematic competence ego-here. Again, such applications <br>
occur in perception only through occurrent sensory stimuli. (I discuss this competence or <br>
capacity in Chapter 8.)<br>
<br>
Perceptual attributives differ from predicates in language or conceptual attributives in <br>
thought in that they are produced and exercised in a perceptual system. Unlike predicates, <br>
they lack a function in propositional structures and propositional inference. However, <br>
their attributive functions form the base on which predication, or conceptual attribution, <br>
are built.<br>
<br>
Because of their role in being ways of representing and being markers of perceptual <br>
perspective, and because they help individuate psychological states, perceptual attribu-<br>
tives are more fine-grained than the attributes that they indicate and attribute. There are <br>
many perceptual attributives for any given perceptually represented attribute, because <br>
there are many perceptual competencies that can represent any given entity—particular or <br>
type. So although they attribute attributes, perceptual attributives do so in psychologically <br>
specific, perspectival ways.<br>
<br>
Like schematic constituents, perceptual attributives are applied in attributional applica-<br>
tions by perceptual referential applications. Recall that referential perceptual applications Three Basic Representational Constituents 45</div>
