referential application, and its spatial relation to the whole of which it is a part is normally <br>
characterized. Parts, down to the limits of perceptual discernibility, are themselves com-<br>
monly perceived as having parts. Analogous points apply to the complexity of temporal <br>
organization. I return to these matters in Chapters 8 and 9.<br>
<br>
Any normal perception has a colossal number of perceptual referential applications and <br>
perceptual attributives. My illustrations of perceptual contents are <i>always</i> oversimplified, <br>
abstractions from such huge structures. In the remainder of Part I, I work my way toward <br>
sketching this greater complexity from the deliberately oversimplified starting point.<br><br>

<b>Perception of Property-Instances<br><br>
</div>
</b>Because the representational structure of perception is part of the accuracy conditions of <br>
perceptual states, and because accuracy involves matching the environment, I must dis-<br>
cuss some fine points about the environment and about semantical relations to it. Some of <br>
these points count in philosophy as metaphysics. I think that they can be understood in <br>
scientific terms.<br>
<br>
I start by reviewing three background points.<br>
<br>
First, I distinguish sharply between what is perceived, or perceptually referred to, and <br>
what is perceptually attributed. The property or kind <i>body</i> is attributed, not perceived. <br>
Attributes are not perceived because they lack relevant causal power, and what is perceived <br>
causes the perceptual states. Bodies—instances of the kind <i>body</i>—are perceived. The rela-<br>
tion <i>farther away from (with respect to here)</i> is attributed, not perceived. One particular <br>
is perceived as farther away than another particular with respect to viewer position <br>
(where neither of the perceived entities is a relation). There is absolutely no question that <br>
science takes perception to attribute attribute-types. A perceptual competence to attribute <br>
a type is a capacity to exercise a pattern of representational response to types of attributes <br>
in the environment—shapes, sizes, colors, motions, bodies, spatial relations, temporal rela-<br>
tions, and so on. The heart of the science studies these competencies—types of perception-<br>
occurrence in characterizing particulars by their types.<br>
<br>
Second, entities that are perceived are always particulars—instances of attributes. <br>
Perceived particulars are located in specific spatial, temporal regions. Attribute-types, <br>
which are repeatable in different particulars or instances, are not perceived. They are indi-<br>
cated and attributed. One does not see the color-type <i>red</i> or the shape-type <i>cubical</i>. They <br>
are not particulars. One attributes the types. Perceptual sensing depends on causal rela-<br>
tions to what is perceived. Color and shape types lack relevant causal power. They are not <br>
localized in space and time in the way that their perceived particular instances are. One <br>
perceives only entities—particulars—that occupy specific spatio-temporal regions, and <br>
that participate in causal processes that occurrently stimulate perceptual states. So if one <br>
literally sees—perceives—a color, one perceives something localized in space and time, a <br>
color-instance. Of course, perceiving a particular depends on capacities to perceptually <br>
respond to types, some of which the particular instantiates.<br>
<br>
Third, perception of a particular—perceptual reference to a particular—depends on an <br>
occurrent causal chain between the particular and the perceptual state. The chain occurs <br>
at a specific place and time. It is an occurrent event or process that extends from a particu-<br>
lar to a perceptual-state occurrence or occurrent aspect of a perceptual-state occurrence. </div>
