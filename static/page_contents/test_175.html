 (5) if there is no perceived particular to cross-attribute an attribute-type or attribute <br>
<br>
instance to; [suppose that one accurately perceives an instance of brownness as <br>
<br>
such, say in an amorphous gas, has a referential illusion as of a body, and the per-<br>
<br>
ceptual system functions to attribute the type <i>brown</i> and the instance of <i>brown</i> to <br>
<br>
the purported body].<br><br>
<i>Intra-attribute</i> attribution of attribute-<i>types</i> fails:<br><br>
 (1) if the attributive does not indicate an attribute-type;<br>
<br>
 (2) if the attributive indicates an attribute-type, but the indicated attribute is not <br>
<br>
instantiated by a particular that is referred to in the application of the attributive; <br>
<br>
[suppose that one perceives a shape-instance as cubical, but the instance instantiates <br>
<br>
cylindricality];<br><br>
or (inclusive)<br><br>
 (3) if the referential application that applies the attributive fails to secure a referent; <br>
<br>
[suppose that one has a referential illusion of there being an instance of <i>cubical</i> <br>
<br>
or <i>brown</i>].<br><br>
A summary of the semantics of perceptual representational contents follows. Perceptual <br>
states, and their representational contents, are fully accurate if and only if every referential <br>
application is to a referred-to, perceived particular and every attribution is accurate <i>of</i> the <br>
particular(s) that the attribution is made to. Perceptual states, and their representational <br>
contents, can be partly accurate, but not fully accurate, if some but not all of their attribu-<br>
tions are accurate of particulars to which the attributions are made—accurate of particu-<br>
lars that are referred to by relevant referential applications. Perceptual states are inaccurate <br>
if they are not fully accurate.<br><br>

<b>Perceptual Attribution of Relations<br><br>
</div>
</b>Many perceptual spatial attributives—which determine distance, ordinal depth, or location— <br>
attribute relations anchored to a perceiver-centered origin. One perceives a particular as <br>
being in some location (direction and distance) with respect to one’s position. One sees <br>
one surface as being to the left of another, with respect to one’s current position.<br>
<br>
As discussed in Chapter 8, the section Egocentric Temporal Frameworks <br>
and Perceptual Representation of Motion, tracking a body’s motion within a <br>
given perception requires relating the body and the instance of motion to a starting place <br>
and time and a moved-to place and time, and often speed of motion during the motion <br>
segment. Direction and speed of motion are attributed relative to the perceiver’s position; <br>
and the temporal order of motion stages is tracked.<br>
<br>
Perception of a surface as part of a larger surface is another common type of relational <br>
attribution. One can perceive one body or route as longer than another, or one body or piece <br>
of ground as being larger than another. <i>Part of</i>, <i>longer than</i>, and <i>larger than</i> are relations.</div>
