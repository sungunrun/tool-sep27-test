Accuracy Conditions for Tracking Particulars 251</div>

I enter the tracking marker as a superscript on symbols for referential applications. <br>
Thus, (that xa1), (that xa2), and (that xa3) are three referential applications that function to <br>
feed a single memory-tracking-file, designated by superscript ‘a’. The perceptual referential <br>
applications are distinct in that they are produced by different causal chains entering the <br>
perceptual system. If they all succeed in referring and tracking, they mark different per-<br>
ceptions of a common particular. The perceptual referential applications that function to <br>
track a particular are distinct, also, because success in tracking across perceptual states is <br>
not guaranteed, logically or representationally—as co-reference is guaranteed by anaph-<br>
ora. In cases in which referents of perceptual states that function to track a single particu-<br>
lar are not shared, the tracking fails, even though each perceptual state may succeed in <br>
picking out a particular. Then the memory file’s referential application has the referent of a <br>
dominantly but only partially tracked particular, if any.<br>
<br>
The superscript need not occur if a referential application is not in a tracking sequence. <br>
For example, in a one-off perception followed by darkness or by a major shift in scene, <br>
tracking may not occur. Then the memory of the particular might be sustained by anaph-<br>
ora, not by functional linking in perceptual tracking. The vast preponderance of percep-<br>
tual states engage in at least short-term tracking. Tracking normally occurs within and <br>
between saccades (eye shifts). Tracking is involved in nearly all perception of motion. All <br>
exercises of object constancy involve tracking.<br>
<br>
A lot is known about the tracking phenomenon. Primate perceptual systems are cap able <br>
of rapidly setting up and maintaining numerous memory files under short, even signifi-<br>
cantly separated exposures. (See discussions of Thorpe’s work and Potter’s work, in <br>
Chapters 10–11 and of Pylyshyn’s work in Chapter 15.) The diachronic span of tracking <br>
mechanisms is considerable. There is very short-term tracking, both within a given per-<br>
ception and in trans-saccadic tracking. The latter enlists various types of short-term per-<br>
ceptual memory. (See Chapter 8, the section Egocentric Temporal Frameworks <br>
and Perceptual Representation of Motion; Chapter 16, the section Trans-<br>
Saccadic Memory.) There is tracking that involves interaction between perception <br>
and long-term perceptual memory. (See Chapter 17, the section Episodic Visual <br>
Memory; <i>De Re</i> Long-term Non-Episodic Visual Memory.)<br>
<br>
It is important to distinguish fallible <i>diachronic tracking</i> among referential applications <br>
from <i>diachronic anaphoric connection</i> between perception and <i>some</i> memory and anticipation, <br>
discussed in Chapter 2, the section The Three Fundamental Representational <br>
Constituents in Perceptual States. I return to anaphoric and fallible tracking <br>
connections in memory in Chapter 9, the section Some Ways Not to Think of <br>
Iconic Representation and Chapter 17, the section Visual Episodic Memory. <br>
In the latter, diachronic anaphoric connection cases, two occurrences of referential appli-<br>
cation are tied together so as to be occurrences of a single referential application. It is <br>
 logically and representationally impossible for the two occurrences to have different referents. <br>
A trans-saccadic memory can contain an occurrence of a referential application that is an <br>
instance of the same application established in the perceptual state that the memory func-<br>
tions to retain. For the referent, if any, of the second occurrence, the one in memory, <br>
depends entirely on the referent, if any, of the first occurrence in the perceptual state. The <br>
occurrence of the referential application anaphorically preserved in memory has its refer-<br>
ence purely from the causal chain from perception to memory, where this chain is an <br>
extension of the chain that led from the particular that the perceptual state picks out. That </div>
