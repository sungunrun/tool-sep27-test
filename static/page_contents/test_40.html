co-referring is fallible in that respect. For example, if a thought that instantiates the form if <br>
that F exists, then that F is that F is fallible—could fail to be true—, then the applications <br>
of the two occurrences of that in the consequent are distinct. If a perceptual state func-<br>
tions to track a given particular over time, then, given that the tracking is fal lible, different <br>
referential applications figure in the tracking. (I discuss this case in detail in Chapter 7, the <br>
section Referential Applications in Perceptual Constancies.)<br>
<br>
Across possible worlds, I think that a referential application <i>a</i> could have referred to a <br>
particular that is different from the one it actually refers to.36 A referential application that <br>
in fact applies to a particular <i>x</i> might have failed to apply to it, if the same referential event <br>
had been caused by a different particular, or by some process that did not derive from any <br>
perceived particular. An actual perception might have failed referentially. No actual per-<br>
ceptual state is infallibly referential. It could been a referential illusion.<br>
<br>
Of course, as noted, even in the actual world, some referential applications lack a refer-<br>
ent. I do not propose a criterion for either the identity of occurrent events, or the identity <br>
of referential applications. One discovers and identifies perceptual referential applications <br>
by empirical theory.<br>
<br>
Since perceptual referential applications are occurrence-based instantiations of percep-<br>
tual competencies, they are instantiations of perceptual representational contents. More <br>
specifically, referential applications are occurrent exercises of perceptual competencies. <br>
The perceptual referential applications are also constituents of representational contents. <br>
For referential applications in perception, the distinction between representational con-<br>
tents and representations collapses. Referential applications are both representations and <br>
representational contents. Although one can isolate referential applications as distinctive <br>
elements in representational contents, no referential application is ever a stand-alone rep-<br>
resentational content of a psychological state. Occurrent referential applications are always <br>
applications of repeatable representational competencies. I explain this point in Chapter 5.<br>
<br>
I turn now to the second constituent in all perceptual states. Perceptual referential <br>
applications are instantiations or exercises of repeatable, ability-general competencies. <br>
These are repeatable competencies to refer to or pick out particulars in a contextual, cause-<br>
dependent way. The repeatable competencies are analogous to demonstrative compe-<br>
tencies in language, except that, unlike demonstrative competencies, they are not <br>
competencies for action. Still, they are repeatable competencies to refer in a context-<br>
dependent, occurrent, causally dependent way.<br>
<br>
I call such competencies ‘<i>schematic</i>’. They are representational competencies. They do <br>
not, however, represent anything in themselves.37 They are competencies to represent par-<br>
ticulars. In themselves they represent no particulars. (By contrast, attributive competen-<br>
cies indicate <i>representata</i>, types, even when they are not exercised; they do not attribute <br><br>

the Logic of Demonstratives’. My semantics for referential applications in perception is not embedded in an <br>
intensional logic. I think that one can minimally understand the meaning of the word ‘that’ and be competent <br>
with the representational content of the perceptual schema that (or ego-here) independently of understanding <br>
