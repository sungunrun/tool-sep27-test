Primitive Attribution of Mechanical Causation 459</div>

A second argument centers on use of information about the entities in the cause or <br>
effect role in forming causal impressions. 6-month-olds find movement of an originally <br>
stationary block without there being any contact by a block moving toward it to be anom-<br>
alous if and only if the infant has already represented the first block as inert and not a <br>
self-mover. That is, “launching” without contact is found surprising if and only if the <br>
launched entity has been previously seen to be inert.595 Similarly, the presence of certain <br>
causal impressions depends on whether the entity in the role of the cause has been repre-<br>
sented as a self-mover.596<br>
<br>
In some ingenious experiments, Rebecca Saxe and Susan Carey showed that infants’ <br>
causal representations integrate representations of the kinds of entities in cause and effect <br>
roles. They showed that infants project these impressions to cases where the causal event is <br>
not visible.597<br>
<br>
Infants were familiarized with bean bags on a stage—suggesting that the bean bags <br>
are inert. Infants were then habituated to bean bags, in no predictable order, flying <br>
over each of the screens, one to the left, the other to the right side of the stage. The <br>
bean bags landed on the stage between the screens. After habituation, the screens were <br>
 lowered, to show a hand behind one screen and a toy train behind the other. The <br>
screens were then raised again. A bean bag flew from behind one of the screens onto <br>
the stage. Infants dishabituated only if the bean bag came from behind the screen <br>
where the toy train was. They maintained habituation if a bean bag flew from behind <br>
the screen where the hand was. The authors took the experiment to show that the <br>
infants represented the unseen cause of the bean bag’s motion, expecting the cause to <br>
be a hand not a toy train.<br>
<br>
These observations ground a second argument, similar to the first, against the Michotte <br>
hypothesis that primitive representation of mechanical causation is perceptual. The argu-<br>
ment is advanced by Carey, and earlier by Saxe and Carey:<br><br>
The overall message of these studies is that 6-to 7-month-old infants already form <br>
<br>
ex pect ations with causal content that cannot be explained by the output of Michotte’s <br>
<br>
module for perceptual causality. Their inferences rely on the categorization of the entities <br>
<br>
in the situational agent and patient roles in terms of enduring causal dispositional states. <br>
<br>
These results are not incompatible with the existence of a perceptual module in early <br>
<br>
infancy. Richly integrated causal inferences may exist alongside an encapsulated module. <br>
<br>
But clearly, not all of an infant’s earliest causal representations are modular. Thus, these <br>
<br>
results weigh clearly against Michotte’s contention that the perceptual module is the sin-<br>
<br>
gle original source of all true causal concepts . . .<br><br>
