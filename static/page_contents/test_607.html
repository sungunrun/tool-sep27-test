where perceptual attributives connect to their conceptualizations. Of course, the symbols <br>
are retained in long-term memory. Often the symbols were learned via demonstrative ref-<br>
erence to a perceived entity. The term ‘cat’ and the concept expressed by it were probably <br>
first learned through association with perceived bodies of certain shapes and sizes. The <br>
perceptual system would have the specific body-categorization attributive before the word <br>
is learned. Whether this perceptual attributive is conceptualized before, or only after, lan-<br>
guage is learned seems empirically open.<br>
<br>
In either case, the linguistic symbol gets associated with a cat-body perceptual attribu-<br>
tive, or a range of memory templates that cover many iconic cat-shape templates, or tem-<br>
plates of cat-body parts. These perceptual representational contents are thereby connected, <br>
to a network of propositional competencies—those in which the mastery of the linguistic <br>
symbol is embedded. Conceptualization of the perceptual attributives is likely to begin <br>
with the first, perceptually based learning of the symbol—if it does not occur earlier. Thus <br>
a concept for <i>cat-body</i>  would be connected to perceptual attributives that categorize cat-<br>
shaped bodies. That is likely to be the first concept expressed by a child’s word ‘cat’. With <br>
further learning and development, a child is likely to acquire a concept that is not constitu-<br>
tively attached to a look—perhaps one that could be shared with a blind person. Such a <br>
concept might or might not be a natural kind concept. A concept for the natural kind <i>cat</i> <br>
would apply only to cats, not to just any body with the size, shape, and movement of a cat. <br>
Such a concept develops in childhood in most or all humans. Potter’s adult subjects had <br>
developed the natural kind concept expressed by ‘cat’. They all retained in long-term mem-<br>
ory a connection between the word and the look (an attributive or attributives) for <br>
cat-bodies.<br>
<br>
The connection between the word and the perceptual attributive was established earlier <br>
in the subject’s history, directly by perceiving the word and connecting it with a visual <br>
attributive for cat-body. The effect of enhancing CSTM memory for perceptual attribu-<br>
tives for cat-bodies in rapid serial presentation of pictures derives from connections <br>
already entrenched in long-term memory, brought into cueing status in the experiment.<br>
<br>
The long-term memory of a connection between the word and the perceptual attribu-<br>
tives (and the conceptualizations of those attributives that were at some point expressed <br>
by the word) got to be consolidated through shorter-term memories—by hypothesis those <br>
in CSTM and/or working memory—that feed long-term memory. Long-term memory is <br>
the ultimate source of the effects produced by the target-cueing words in the RSVP <br>
experiments.<br>
<br>
CSTM is a major feeder of long-term memory—with both perceptual and conceptual <br>
representations. Sometimes perceptual states, and concepts that they are associated with, <br>
are consolidated into long-term memory even on very brief exposure. Consolidation often <br>
depends on activation, by a perception, of a perceptual categorization or perceptual gist-<br>
type attributive stored in long-term memory. Single brief exposures that are backwardly <br>
masked, or that fail to connect with anything contextually important, are mostly lost to <br>
long-term memory.938<br>
<br>
What is retained in long-term memory depends <i>most</i> on immediate organization of <br>
new information into significant, often previously encountered, structures. It is an open <br><br>
