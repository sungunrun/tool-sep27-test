associations, and image matching or template matching. Retention is not a supra-<br>
perceptual-level operation.<br>
<br>
Memory is not <i>in itself</i> a cognitive capacity. (See Chapters 16–17 and Chapter 19, the <br>
section Uses and Misuses of the Term ‘Cognition’.) Recall from Chapter 1, the <br>
section Perceptual States as Sensory States, that perceptual memory is mem-<br>
ory that functions to retain perceptual contents from previous perceptual states. Perceptual <br>
memory is perceptual-level. Association is an operation that occurs at pre-representational <br>
and perceptual levels. It is certainly not supra-perceptual. Associations in these processes <br>
are products of perceptual learning. Personal learning is not supra-perceptual. <br>
Comparisons that relate memory of gist to categorizations are simply image matchings. <br>
Image matching is a standard operation that occurs at pre-representational as well as per-<br>
ceptual levels.<br>
<br>
Sometimes authors assume that sensitivity to incongruity between a categorization and <br>
a gist-representation is conceptual, or entails being supra-perceptual by providing “mean-<br>
ing”. A response to a representation of a pig-body in a kitchen-type ensemble of surfaces is <br>
taken to be an example of cognitive or conceptual use of “meaning” because it is indicative <br>
of a sense of incongruity. But incongruity does not entail conceptuality or propositionality. <br>
The incongruity discussed in the gist literature is just the converse of association. A sense <br>
of incongruity here is a sense of lack of association, or clashing with association, again at <br>
the perceptual level.<br>
<br>
In computational explanations of perceptual-state formation, the richer perceptual cat-<br>
egor iza tions are formed by fast interactions with perceptual memory, which stores both <br>
images of bodily shapes and sizes that typify various category groupings and images of <br>
typical gist ensembles. This enrichment of categorization is perceptual level. It is <br>
perceptual-level processing of perceptual attributives. There is no reliance on supra-<br>
perceptual-level operations, or contents, in computational models of the formation of <br>
enriched categorization after 150 ms from stimulus onset.<br>
<br>
None of this is to deny that there are propositional beliefs and propositional memories <br>
about associations between scene-gist ensembles. Concepts in these background prop os-<br>
ition al states may indicate ensembles of shapes and sizes of surfaces and bodies as such, <br>
thus sharing indicants with perceptual attributives. Or they may indicate the ensembles in <br>
ways that have no counterparts in perception—perhaps pig, kettle, romance, kitchen, read-<br>
ing, stadium.662 Although I think that these beliefs and propositional memories are usually <br>
effects of the perceptual memories, not causes, they can be causes. The point here is not <br>
that they, or attention deriving from them, cannot function as causes of some perceptual <br>
gist memories. They may enhance or trigger retention and guide comparison. The point is <br>
two-fold. First, there is no evidence that they are <i>indispensable</i> to the patterns of <br>
perceptual-level transactions that are typically described in psychophysical models. <br>
Computational models are silent about such higher-level processes. They do not seem to <br>
need to represent them. So any antecedent causal “drivers” of gist memories are not <br><br>

<b>FOOTNOTES</b><br>
<b>FN</b>662 The examples of <i>zebra</i>, <i>reading</i>, <i>book</i>, and <i>romance</i> come from remarks by Bar, ‘Vision in Context’. Some <br>
philosophers have noted that only concepts are likely to apply to these attributes, and have leapt to the conclusion <br>
that Bar’s account requires concepts. Bar provides no computational model for his important account, and it is <br>
not evident that he has thought about differences between, say, <i>zebra</i>, and <i>zebra-body.</i> His glosses on his experi-<br>
ments do not support the view that his account <i>requires</i> concepts, much less that computational models that <br>
capture his insights will invoke concepts.</div>
