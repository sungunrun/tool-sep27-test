perceptual and use states are certainly different: their contents, veridicality conditions, <br>
and representational functions differ. People disagree about such metaphysical points. My <br>
conception of causation does not recognize simultaneous causation in these cases. I see no <br>
good reason to take the idea seriously.<br>
<br>
Appropriately, Gross asks for a rationale for a “demanding” conception of use and guid-<br>
ance that requires a temporal lag. What I have said points toward the rationale that I relied <br>
on. The idea is that it is constitutive of psychological content of a given state that it be <br>
involved in a network of other psychological states, including states with practical import, <br>
where the contents (the representational kinds) of the states help ground the pattern of <br>
inter-relations. A belief’s content must be associated with some further potential use of it: <br>
not only carrying out inferences, but in its guiding representational practical responses. A <br>
perceptual state’s content is similar. It must be associated with the contents of other states <br>
in a perceptual constancy and with connecting with other states that make practical repre-<br>
sentational use of the perceptual state’s representational kind. The motivation follows in <br>
the tradition of Wittgenstein’s exaggerated but instructive claim: “meaning is use”. <br>
Meaning—representational content—is not the same as use. But psychological states have <br>
their content—are what they are—partly because they enter into networks of relations <br>
with other psychological states in a system that connects to the world by both gaining <br>
information from the world and operating practically back on it.282<br>
<br>
The inter-relations must include practical use because representational content itself is <br>
individuated not only through taking in information but also through using the informa-<br>
tion to operate back onto the world. In effect, what one operates back on helps fix what <br>
specific representational information one obtains from the world.<br>
<br>
This reciprocal taking-in-from-and-operating-back-onto relation must be in place both <br>
at pre-representational and representational levels. Representational content is fixed both <br>
by what an individual pre-representationally acts on in response to pre-representational <br>
sensing and by what one representationally operates on (actively or not) guided by percep-<br>
tual representation. One can think crudely of representation’s coming to be representation <br>
by entering into these two-way networks. Individuals give meaning to, or more accurately <br>
establish, the most basic representational contents through using what one sensorily takes <br>
in to guide operating back on the world. The content is determined partly by its use in <br>
relation to cases.<br>
<br>
I take this rationale to support widely held judgments that desk computers with electric <br>
eyes, no matter how well the mechanisms associated with eyes mimic perceptual <br><br>

<b>FOOTNOTES</b><br>
<b>Cont FN</b>282 I took the rationale for (1) and (2) to be so familiar, from the tradition mentioned in the text, that I did not <br>
lay it out in detail in Burge, <i>Origins of Objectivity</i>. I made the point in detail in Burge, ‘Memory and Persons’. I <br>
cited it several times in the book Gross discusses: <i>Origins of Objectivity</i>, 70n12, 80, 292, 302, 370–372. (See note <br>
46 above.) It is part of my conception of anti-individualism: content-determination depends not only on patterns <br>
of environment affecting the individual, but also on patterns of causation from individual to the environment. <br>
Gross clearly did not find the tradition relevant. He thinks mistakenly that my only rationale for (1) and <br>
(2) resides in an argument I gave earlier in <i>Origins of Objectivity</i>, 319–326. That argument maintained that func-<br>
tional use of content is needed to make content determinate, in the face of contrived alternatives that were, at the <br>
time, popular among those who raised sceptical questions about the nature or need for representational content <br>
in naturalistic explanations. That argument did provide a role for use in understanding content. But it was just a <br>
specialization of what I took to be the broader rationale laid out in the text above and in Burge, ‘Perceptual <br>
Objectivity’—a rationale that I took to be widely understood and accepted among philosophers of language and <br>
mind since mid-twentieth century. I articulate it further below. See also Chapter 2, the section Scientific <br>
Practice Demarcates Perceptual Constancies from Other Invariances; and Burge, <i>Origins <br>
of Objectivity</i>, 396–416.</div><div id="PGHEADER">
