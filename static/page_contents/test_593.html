modifying their accounts, for example by combining slot limits with resource limits.882 <br>
These moves undermined the simplicity of original slot proposals, in effect producing <br>
hybrid views that combine slot-and continuous-resource ideas.<br>
<br>
Subsequent experimental findings strongly suggest more factors than simply object <br>
effects and continuous-resource effects. For example, there are complex hierarchical <br>
effects. Bearers of properties—“objects”—do seem to make greater demands on storage <br>
capacity than their properties. But there are subtle costs for remembering additional prop-<br>
erties for a given object.883 There is some evidence that there is no easily stated <i>fixed</i> limit <br>
on resources or “objects”. Depending on the task and on issues of crowding, including ana-<br>
tomically based crowding, available resources seem to vary.884 Moreover, aspects of a dis-<br>
play to be remembered, such as perceptual grouping and texture, for a single set size, <br>
affects memory capacity. Ensemble statistics are relevant to memory capacity. For ex ample, <br>
if an individual remembers that colors in a display of objects were on average toward the <br>
brown-red area of the color spectrum, and in a change detection paradigm one item <br>
changes from red to green, it is more likely that the change is detected. Remembering <br>
ensemble statistics counts toward working memory capacity.885 These findings are incon-<br>
sistent with the idea that a set object number is the only, or perhaps even main, factor in <br>
determining storage capacity in working memory. They are also inconsistent with simple <br>
fixed-resource views.<br>
<br>
At present, it remains unclear whether there is a fixed upper bound specifically on the <br>
number of objects that can be remembered in visual working memory. The precise rela-<br>
tion between object-effect advantages and object limits, on one hand, and the quality, <br>
reso lution, and confidence of memory representation, on the other, has not been settled. <br>
Ways in which various types of non-independence among objects affect working memory <br>
have not been adequately mapped. Views about how memory resources can be allocated <br>
and re-allocated are in flux. The ways in which object representations and feature repre-<br>
sentations interact, and the nature of hierarchical structures in working memory, remain <br>
to be determined.886<br>
<br>
Most experiments regarding storage still test memory of artificial objects—such as bars <br>
and half-circles of unitary color, segregated from one another in 2-D arrays. The true <br><br>
