<b>Perceptual Constancy: A Central Natural <br><br>
Psychological Kind<br><br>
</div>
</b>Perhaps the most fundamental and important fact about our conscious <br>
<br>
ex peri ence of object properties is that they are more closely correlated with <br>
<br>
the intrinsic properties of the <i>distal stimulus</i> . . . than they are with the properties <br>
<br>
of the <i>proximal stimulus</i> (the image on the retina). This is perhaps so obvious <br>
<br>
that it is easily overlooked. How it happens is not so easy to explain, however.<br>
<br>
Stephen Palmer, <i>Vision Science</i>: <i>Photons to Phenomenology<br><br>
</i>In this chapter, I distinguish perceptual constancies from other constancies or invariances. <br>
Specifically, I distinguish perceptual constancies from non-perceptual invariances that <br>
consist in selective filtering of information registrations of proximal stimuli.<br>
<br>
I begin by reviewing points about perceptual constancies from Chapter 2. Those capaci-<br>
ties mark an unsharp but deep and momentous joint in nature. This joint divides perceiv-<br>
ing from non-perceptual sensing. It divides the representational from the merely <br>
information-registrational. All organisms—animals, plants, protists, fungi, monera—<br>
engage in information registration. Bacteria sense light. They lack mental capacities. Some <br>
but not all animals with perception represent in a psychologically distinctive sense of ‘rep-<br>
resent’. Perceptual representation is the first form of representational mind. Perceptual <br>
constancies mark the advent of perception.<br>
<br>
<i>Perceptual constancies</i> are perceptual capacities systematically to represent a given <br>
en vir on men tal particular or attribute <i>as</i> that particular or attribute under significant dif-<br>
ferences in registration of proximal stimulation. The differences in registration of prox-<br>
imal stimulation yield different perceptual perspectives, or modes of presentation—different <br>
representations and different kinds of perceptual states. In a perceptual constancy, the dif-<br>
ferent perceptual states with different representational contents form a network of states <br>
any one of which a perceptual system can produce. The different states whose representa-<br>
tional contents vary with types of proximal stimulation have a common <i>representatum</i>—a <br>
common, represented attribute or particular. What drives the distinction between percep-<br>
tual constancies and non-perceptual invariances is that the former exhibit objectification. <br>
(See Chapter 2, the section Perception as Objectification.) This chapter explores <br>
how this abstract point is elaborated concretely in scientific explanations.<br>
<br>
It follows from the explication of perceptual constancy that perceptual constancies are not <br>
<i>represented</i> in perception. They are not represented entities. They are also not types or instances <br>
of perceptual states. They are capacities to produce various inter-related perceptual states.<br>
<br>
For example, many perceptual systems can represent a surface as a given size whether <br>
the surface produces a large proportion of proximal stimulation or a much smaller pro-<br>
portion. In a perceptual size constancy, different types of possible perceptual state—with </div>
