Episodic and Other <i>De Re</i> Long-Term Memory 619</div>
<br><br>
Ability-general long-term memory figures centrally in learning, including perceptual <br>
learning. (See Chapter 16, the section Conceptual Short-Term Memory.) <br>
Learning to retain nuances among different shapes of cars, and rendering car-shape <i>per se</i> <br>
as a salient perceptual unit, depend on unconscious comparisons of memories of past <br>
shapes with presently perceived shapes. Retained perception of shape-types that figure <br>
prominently in one’s life also contributes to discriminating among sub-types, and to en ab-<br>
ling one to refine perceptual and supra-perceptual performance.<br><br>

<b>Episodic Visual Memory; </b><i>De Re</i><b> Long-Term Non-Episodic Visual Memory<br><br>
</div>
</b>In this section, I discuss types of long-term visual perceptual memory that differ from the <br>
entirely ability-general type in including <i>de re</i> reference to past-perceived particulars. <br>
<i>Visual perceptual episodic memory</i> is long-term perceptual <i>de re</i> memory of particulars <br>
that retains some of the perspective of the perceptions from which the memory derives. <br>
<i>Visual perceptual non-episodic</i> de re <i>memory</i> of particulars retains perceptual <i>de re</i> refer-<br>
ence to particulars, from one or more perceptions of the particulars, but whose attribu-<br>
tives do not retain specific, occurrent, <i>attributional</i> applications from specific past <br>
perceptions. Perceptual attributives stored in non-episodic <i>de re</i> memory may not betoken <br>
instances anymore. Unlike episodic memories, they do not retain specific attributives <br>
from perceptions, only some of those perceptions’ indicants. Episodic memory is dis soci-<br>
able from ability-general long-term memory.968<br>
<br>
Episodic memory is widely discussed in psychological and even philosophical litera-<br>
tures. I focus on visual episodic memory. It is rarely distinguished from <i>de re</i> non-episodic <br>
visual memory. Episodic memory is often conflated with just any memory for particulars. <br>
Both are species of visual perceptual long-term memory. Both differ from ability-general <br>
long-term perceptual memory in being <i>de re</i>. That is, both function to refer to past per-<br>
ceived particulars by retaining a memory file referring to them, where the memory file is <br>
fed by referential applications. Occasionally, the past referential applications are retained <br>
anaphorically. More commonly, they are fallibly tracked in a memory file. (See Chapter 7, <br>
the section Referential Applications in Accuracy Conditions for <br>
Tracking Particulars.) What distinguishes episodic memory is that it retains how <br>
the past-perceived particulars were perceived on specific occasions. Some of the attribu-<br>
tives are retained from a perceptual episode.<br>
<br>
I think that <i>de re</i> non-episodic memory and episodic memory are probably not distinct <br>
memory systems, but differ in degrees of specificity in what particulars are represented <br>
and how.<br>
<br>
Often included in characterizations of episodic memory is a requirement that it be con-<br>
sciously accessible. With many psychologists, I drop the consciousness requirement. I take <br>
both accessible and inaccessible memories that fit the rest of the characterization to be <br><br>
