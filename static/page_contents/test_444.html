concepts that do not conceptualize perceptual attributives, if such concepts rely non-<br>
inferentially on a perceptual application base for their application. Finding that an attribu-<br>
tive is perceptual depends on showing that it is generated by a perceptual system. <br>
Computational modeling of such generation must be guided by the totality of evidence.<br>
<br>
Other psychological phenomena have been cited as being sufficient for showing that a <br>
psychological state is perceptual. For example, the bi-stability or rivalry involved in per-<br>
ception’s shifting from one attributive to another in cue-poor presentations that are <br>
“ambiguous” (as in the duck–rabbit paradigm) has been cited. Bi-stability fails as a prima <br>
facie criterion for being perceptual in the way that adaptation fails. Applications of the <br>
<i>concepts</i> shape of a duck and shape of a rabbit (no hyphens) figure in bi-stable judgments. <br>
Arguing that the applied attributives duck and rabbit are perceptual by virtue bi-stability <br>
in judgments made with them would be a mistake.<br>
<br>
Similarly, pop-out has been taken as diagnostic for sensory or sensory-perceptual states. <br>
Again, pop-out certainly originates at the sensory or sensory-perceptual level. But one <br>
could have a concept red apple (to be distinguished from red apple-shaped apple-body) <br>
that would be subject to pop-out when perceptual attributives for <i>red apple-shaped</i> <i>apple-<br>
body</i> are subject to pop out in a display of all green apples, except for one red one.<br>
<br>
Adaptation, bi-stability, and pop-out originate in sensory or sensory-perceptual states. <br>
But the effects percolate up to concepts that depend directly on perception for their appli-<br>
cation, even if the concepts lack a perceptual counterpart that indicates the same attribute.<br>
<br>
A further type of evidence often thought to determine by itself that a competence to <br>
attribute a given property (or relation) is perceptual is evidence that a response is retino-<br>
topic—depends on retinal location of the stimulus.568 Visual perceptual attributives do <br>
involve a mode of presentation, or perspective, that depends partly on how light strikes <br>
the retina. They are perceptual attributives insofar as they are capacities embedded in a <br>
perceptual constancy. Although given perceptual attributives represent attributes instanti-<br>
ated in the distal environment, their modes of presentation—the ways in which they pre-<br>
sent an attribute, hence the representational content of the perceptual attribution—can <br>
incorporate the angle at which that attribute affects the retina.<br>
<br>
For example, when one looks at something from a certain angle, one may attribute a <br>
certain shape in a given position in space. If one’s eyes shift direction, creating a different <br>
angle of viewing, the shape affects a different retinal position. The new perceptual state <br>
may attribute the same shape in the same position. The retinal effect of the shape is differ-<br>
ent. The perceptual attributives for shape are different, even though they attribute the <br>
same shape. Attributives mark perceptual capacities. Perceptual capacities for attributing a <br>
given attribute from different angles of perspective are inevitably different. Their effects on <br>
action may differ by being slower or faster.<br>
<br>
The difficulty for taking retinotopic effects to signal perceptual attribution is similar to <br>
the difficulty for taking adaptation to signal perceptual attribution. <i>Concepts</i> applied <br>
directly on the basis of perception or non-perceptual sensing can also be retinally condi-<br>
tioned. A concept is a repeatable representational capacity that functions to contribute to a <br>
propositional representational capacity. Contributing to such a capacity largely resides in <br><br>
