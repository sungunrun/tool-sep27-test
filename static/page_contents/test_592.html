592 Perceptual Memory: Short-Term Systems</div>
<br><br>
It is widely believed that the storage capacity of working memory is small. However, <br>
there has been little study of its <i>encoding</i> limits. Unless encoding limits are well under-<br>
stood, one cannot be certain what part of the limited recall in visual working memory is <br>
due to storage limits and what part is due to encoding limits. Nearby items, or similar <br>
items presented simultaneously, can be in competition for encoding into storage. Encoding <br>
can also depend on position in the visual field and item category. Configuration in a dis-<br>
play can affect what is encoded about particular items.878<br>
<br>
I assume with most of the field, however, that a significant factor in limiting visual <br>
working memory is storage capacity. Working memory seems to have a smaller storage <br>
capacity than FVSTM. It has a <i>much</i> smaller storage capacity than visual sensory memory, <br>
whose capacity is comparable to that of the original perception, and long-term memory that <br>
is not easily accessible. In the easily consciously accessible aspects of visual memory, work-<br>
ing memory is a bottleneck.<br>
<br>
The question of the storage or load capacity of working memory has engendered one of <br>
the most intense disputes in the field.<br>
<br>
The first view to be proposed was that storage capacity should be understood in terms <br>
of <i>slots</i> for items of information, with fixed resolution. It was proposed that for adult <br>
humans, working memory has 3-4 slots. Defenders usually took a slot to hold a represen-<br>
tation of an integrated object with a variable number of features. Adding features, in cross-<br>
attribute attribution, to an object was supposed not to add to the load, as long as they were <br>
associated with that object. This view was inspired by George Miller’s famous invocation <br>
of a magic number 7.879 After some years, an opposing view emerged. It claimed that there <br>
is a <i>total energy capacity</i> that can be distributed over a varying number of stored items, <br>
with varying resolution.880<br>
<br>
As with most issues in science that are so simply explained, this one turned out to be <br>
much more complex than initial proposals on each side maintained. Evidence of trade-<br>
offs between quantity of information and quality of resolution seemed to undermine slot <br>
proposals.881 More objects could be remembered at lower resolution, or if only a small <br>
amount of information was remembered about each object. Slot defenders responded by <br><br>
