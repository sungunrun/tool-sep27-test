the computational role of perceptual LTM contents in affecting priming, conative process-<br>
ing, or processing of perceptual states, such as perceptual categorizations, after first-formed <br>
perceptions. (See Chapter 13, the section Richer Perceptual Categorization <br>
and Perceptual Processing that Contributes to It). That is, a computa-<br>
tional account of retention in perceptual LTM and of the role of perceptual LTM in prim-<br>
ing, motor commands, and perceptual processing shows no sign of needing to appeal to <br>
conceptual contents, associated with propositional capacities, in LTM. Given current the-<br>
ory, perceptual contents in LTM suffice for input into computations, even if and when <br>
conceptual contents are causal antecedents.957<br>

Partly on these grounds, I think it reasonable to regard visual <i>perceptual</i> long-term <br>
memory as part of the visual system. Of course, it is part of the visual system not in the <br>
sense that it contains perceptions, and not in the sense that it is causally immune from <br>
conceptual-level capacities. Rather, it is a natural auxiliary to perception, providing reten-<br>
tive power and contributing to the specificity and speeding of visual perceptual attribu-<br>
tion, including categorization and recognition, but adding no supra-perceptual-level <br>
representation or operation. Perceptual LTM contributes smoothly to computation in <br>
perceptual processing. I believe that it is reasonably regarded as part of the visuo-motor <br>
system, on similar grounds.<br><br>

</b>I center on types of visual long-term perceptual memory that differ in whether and to <br>
what extent past perceptual representation of particulars is retained. One type does not <br>
retain past perception of particulars at all. I call this type ‘<i>ability-general long-term visual <br>
perceptual memory</i>’. A second type does retain reference to past perceived particulars. It <br>
contains referential applications. These connect for their reference anaphorically or, more <br>
likely, through fallible tracking memory index files. The connections of referents to <br><br>

<b>FOOTNOTES</b><br>
<b>FN</b>957 The following is a sampling of a large literature that supports these points: A. Hollingworth, ‘The <br>
Relationship Between Online Visual Representation of a Scene and Long-Term Scene Memory’, <i>Journal of <br>
Experimental Psychology</i> 31 (2005), 396–411; T. Palmeri and M. Tarr, ‘Visual Object Perception and Long-Term <br>
Memory’, in Luck and Hollingworth eds., <i>Visual Memory</i>; Konkle, Brady, Alvarez, and Oliva, ‘Scene Memory Is <br>
More Detailed Than You Think: The Role of Categories in Visual Long-Term Memory’; T. Konkle, T. Brady, <br>
G. Alvarez, and A. Oliva, ‘Conceptual Distinctiveness Supports Detailed Visual Long-Term Memory for Real-<br>
World Objects’, <i>Journal of Experimental Psychology: General</i> 139 (2010), 558–578. In reading these articles, readers <br>
should be careful to note not just the authors’ words, but the way the theory goes. Hollingworth, like Potter (criti-<br>
cized in Chapter 16, the section Conceptual Short-Term Memory; see also Chapter 19, the section The <br>
Empiricist Model of Perception and Cognition: Degrees of Abstraction) associates con-<br>
cepts with abstractness. Perceptual attributives in iconic format can be quite abstract, as I have repeatedly empha-<br>
sized. There is no suggestion in Hollingworth that long-term retention hinges indispensably on propositional-level <br>
capacities. Palmeri and Tarr once use the term ‘perceptual judgment’. This is a use of ‘judgment’ that does not <br>
carry the propositional implications that it does for philosophers. Similarly, the Konkle <i>et</i> <i>al</i>. articles use ‘concept’ <br>
where ‘perceptual categorizational attributive’ or ‘relatively generic perceptual attributive’ would serve as well. <br>
There is no suggestion of propositional capacities in their account. They discuss relations between generic fea-<br>
tures of gist memory and generic features of object representation through perceptual capacities. Some of the <br>
articles, notably Hollingworth’s, note that long-term visual memory is sensitive to task demands and viewer strat-<br>
egy. This dependence applies to perception itself. Tasks and strategies themselves have a perceptual level, as <br>
Chapter 14 emphasizes. Although there may be antecedent causal drivers of these conative states that are concep-<br>
tual, such drivers are not indispensable to the effects of perceptual-level demands and strategies. The perceptual-<br>
level conative factors are, or will be, integrated into computational accounts of memory, as they are in perceptual <br>
and perceptual-motor processing. There is no evidence that conceptual conative causal antecedents of the <br>
perceptual-level counterparts are also integrated.AQ:2</div>
