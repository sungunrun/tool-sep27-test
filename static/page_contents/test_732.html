uttered item on the ordered list, they fail. If a tagging procedure skips an uttered item and <br>
an object that it might have tagged, they still say the last item in the ordered list in answer <br>
to the question ‘how many?’.1196<br>
<br>
Children appear to follow a rule: when asked ‘how many?’, repeat the last item in the <br>
ordered list, each item of which they had correlated with an object in the set or aggregate. <br>
The rule shows failure to understand that a number applies to the cardinality of the set or <br>
aggregate each of whose members has been tagged by an expression in the list.<br>
<br>
Around 3½ years old, children learn that the items in the list apply to a cardinality of a <br>
set or aggregate for the first through the fourth item. Learning the import for determining <br>
cardinality of larger sets or aggregates comes much later. When it does come, it comes all <br>
at once, up to the last item on the child’s ordered list, which of course varies with <br>
the child.1197<br>
<br>
Even at this stage, children seem not to have mastered the successor function. Suppose <br>
that a child has a count list up to ‘30’. Even when it can say of a set of 27 items that it is 27 <br>
items, using the term in their count list that comes 27th, the child remains poor at tests of <br>
mastery of the successor function. For example, after counting a set of 27, then shown one <br>
object added to the set, then asked whether the new set is 28 or 29, it is at chance. Similarly, <br>
when a child is shown two objects added, and asked whether there are 29 or 28, it is at <br>
chance. Only at around 5½ years old, when children come to recognize that there is no end <br>
to the number count, can they reliably pass these tests.1198 Only then do they show true <br>
arithmetic capacities.<br>
<br>
How are we to understand these proto-arithmetical capacities? They lack obvious ana-<br>
logs in perceptual capacities, beyond tracking small groups of three or four objects.<br>
<br>
The initial capacity to recite a list is no more representational than citing the alphabet. It <br>
is neither perceptual nor supra-perceptual. It is clearly a preparation, however, for cognition.<br>
<br>
The 1–1 tagging, and the rule of answering ‘how many’ with the last sign in a tagging, <br>
show awareness of the relevance of symbols to something broadly mathematical. They are <br>
not easy to interpret. A natural guess is that in 1–1 tagging, each sign in the list is a pro-<br>
noun for the object tagged by the sign in the context. This interpretation is suggested by <br>
the fact that children deny that the last number in the list applies to the set as a whole, but <br>
insist that the last item tagged is to be associated with the sign: ‘No, the group is not 6 <br>
altogether, that one is 6’.<br>
<br>
Evidence tells against this guess. When children are asked to give someone one object in <br>
a group, they do so. For any other number, they give a plural number of items. It is random <br>
<i>what</i> plural number. So it appears that they are neither tracking set cardinality nor taking <br>
the ordered number signs to contextually pick out particulars, in a name-like way. After <br><br>
