Attention and Accuracy 537</div>

Attend: (that x1)[(that x2)(cubicalb4(c)(x1), cubicalb4(i)(x2), bodyd4(i)(x1))]<br><br>
Of course, in attentively tracking a body, one need not, and usually does not, continue to <br>
attend to the shape (type or trope).<br>
<br>
It is not known whether the different types of attention are truly distinct systems. They <br>
may be different aspects of a single system. There is some evidence that exogenous and <br>
endogenous attention are supported by different mechanisms, while drawing on a single <br>
capacity-limited system. Exogenous applications tend to be faster and applied earlier in <br>
the processing sequence. Endogenous applications have a more flexible, potentially longer <br>
application period.747<br>
<br>
It has been claimed that attention does not affect the nature of perceptual states.748 The <br>
implication is that it only enhances their acuity or efficiency. I think the claim mistaken. <br>
Attention affects how, as well as how well, entities are perceived. This is true even when <br>
attention improves acuity. In sharpening a fuzzy perception, or in enhancing contrast, <br>
attention changes a mode of presentation—which is to say, it changes the state-type. <br>
A sharper perception of the same entity can produce faster responses. Since the sharper <br>
perception enters into different law-like causal patterns, it is a different perceptual-state <br>
kind. It has a different representational content—a different mode of presentation. Greater <br>
acuity also brings into view boundaries, gaps, contours not otherwise perceived. So not <br>
only mode of presentation, but <i>representata</i> of perception are affected by attention. So <br>
attention can change accuracy conditions. Mode of presentation, representational content, <br>
the condition made accurate or inaccurate, psychological state (all these phrases specify <br>
the same thing) change when attention affects a perceptual state.<br><br>

</b>Given that the visual system has a finite number of resources, greater allocation of pro-<br>
cessing power to one operation usually yields a correspondingly lesser allocation to <br>
another. It can be safely assumed that, in the main, that there are practical benefits from <br>
initiations of attention. There are also usually representational benefits. Exogenous and <br>
endogenous spatial attention speed processing, improve grouping, enhance luminance <br>
contrast and other contrast sensitivities—making discriminations of visual objects and <br>
properties easier—, augment position coding, and improve spatial resolution or acuity. <br>
The initiation and effects of attention can occur either during perceptual processing, or via <br>
a cue prior to processing.749<br><br>

the percept unchanged’ (p. 5). I criticize the claim about the relation between cueing and attention in Chapter 16, <br>
the section Priming and Memory. Here I focus on the claim that attention leaves percepts unchanged. <br>
I think this claim mistaken in almost every case.<br>
