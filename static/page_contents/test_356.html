356 The Iconic Nature of Perception</div>
<br><br>
The non-relational attributives make attributions, and function to betoken instances, of <br>
the attributes that they indicate. All the non-relational attributives function to carry out <br>
intra-attribute attribution. I suppose that all the listed attributives, except the surface <br>
attributives, also function to carry out cross-attribute attribution.<br>
<br>
One sees a smaller sub-unit <i>Ss</i> as a <i>part</i> of a larger unit surface <i>S</i>, via the iconic format. <br>
One sees the part as a part simultaneously with seeing <i>S</i> as a surface. The iconic format <br>
includes the position of <i>Ss</i> within the position of <i>S</i>. Exercise of the mapping of the larger <br>
unit is a computation that carries representation of the sub-parts along with it.<br>
<br>
Sub-parts are, I think, typically perceived not only as sub-parts of a natural unit but also <br>
as sub-parts of other sub-parts of the natural unit. Sub-parts of a natural unit are also <br>
often perceived as sub-parts of more than one natural-unit surface. For example, a non-<br>
natural unit sub-part <i>S</i>1 might be perceived as a sub-part of both a distinctively colored <br>
part of a triangular surface and as a sub-part of the larger triangular surface. Both the dis-<br>
tinctively colored part and the whole triangular surface are natural units for the perceptual <br>
system. I leave it open whether <i>in general</i> if an observer perceives a sub-part <i>S</i>1 as a part of <br>
natural unit <i>U</i>1 and perceives <i>U</i>1 as a part of a larger natural unit <i>U</i>2, then the observer <br>
perceives <i>S</i>1 as a part of <i>U</i>2. Perhaps perceptual part-of is always applied transitively. <br>
Perhaps it is not. Often it surely is.<br>
<br>
To be seen, even sub-parts that are not natural perceptual units must be discriminated <br>
from every other currently seen entity. The perceptual system functions to discriminate <br>
them via spatial positioning in the iconic matrix. This positioning is usually derivative <br>
from positioning of the type of visual entity—edge, surface, body, 2-D or 3-D shape, that <br>
they are seen as part of. When location fails, the system still normally provides differences <br>
in direction from the viewer and from the natural-unit entity’s other sub-parts. At the root <br>
of discrimination of a seen entity from other currently seen entities is the specific causal <br>
chain that connects the relevant part of the representational matrix with the natural-unit <br>
entity’s seen sub-part.<br>
<br>
Non-natural-unit sub-parts are perceived differently from the natural units. Lacking <br>
natural boundaries, sub-parts are not noticed as discrete particulars. Such sub-parts are <br>
much harder to attend to than natural-unit particulars. But noticing and attending differ <br>
from perceiving.<br>
<br>
Especially with surfaces that are not attributed specific locations, but are seen as bear-<br>
ing ordinal depth relations to other surfaces, the precise position, including the orien ta-<br>
tion of the surfaces (their slant and tilt), is not determinable. Lacking orientation <br>
information, the viewer’s perceptual state cannot localize sub-parts, except directionally in <br>
relation to one another. In fact, with surfaces that do not have smooth changes, a percep-<br>
tual state may not even determine contiguity relations among such sub-parts. There may <br>
be indeterminacies as to what among the sub-parts are perceived in such cases. There <br>
remain causal chains connecting some sub-parts with aspects of the perceptual state. <br>
These chains may, despite inability to discriminate parts from one another on the basis of <br>
different accurate attributions, still support perception of sub-parts.<br>
<br>
Analogs of the just-discussed problem arise for perception of non-natural-unit sub-<br>
parts, even for perception of sub-parts of surfaces that are localized in space. Because acu-<br>
ity is not perfect, smallish parts of a surface that is not smooth may not be assigned precise <br>
positions. In a surface of woven cloth, the orientation of parts of strands of the weave may <br>
not be determinable even at relatively close distances.</div>
