a selection from a complex of attributions is analogous to propositional inference by the <br>
rule of detachment. Similarly, a memory system or actional system can select attributions <br>
in different parts of an iconic perceptual matrix, and adjoin them in a memory that guides <br>
action. For example, an individual may have two perceptions, each as of a lion-body lying <br>
still in different spatial locations. The individual’s psychology can adjoin the attributions <br>
in memory, and use the adjoined attributions for guiding action to avoid both. Such a <br>
combination is analogous to a propositional inference by the rule of adjunction.<br>
<br>
Selection and accumulation of information are generalized operations in psychological <br>
systems. Propositional detachment and adjunction—operations that hinge on the logical <br>
connective, conjunction—are specific versions of these generalized operations. One can-<br>
not conclude from presence of operations that select and adjoin representational contents <br>
that a psychological system has the logical constant, conjunction. That would be to make <br>
the mistake, discussed in Chapter 4, the section Principles Governing <br>
Transitions Contrasted with Representational Contents, of conflating <br>
the nature of an operation with the content of a state. The former is represented by scien-<br>
tists who discover principles governing states and processes. The content is meta-<br>
representational. It does not occur in primitive representational systems that do not <br>
specify their operation rules.<br><br>

</div>
</b>I have characterized representational contents of perceptual states as sharing structure <br>
with noun phrases governed by applied context-dependent referential determiners. <br>
Representational structure follows representational function. The primary representa-<br>
tional function of perceptual states is to pick out particulars by their attributes. This func-<br>
tion is constitutive to all perception. The function is reflected in the nominal form.<br>
<br>
Representational function is grounded in representational competence. This is the <br>
competence to pick out particulars by causal relations to them, where the relevant particu-<br>
lars are delimited by a characterizing competence that guides and channels the picking-<br>
out competence.<br>
<br>
Any noun-phrase-like structure can be expanded into a propositional structure. For <br>
example, a perceptual representation of the form that1 F can be expanded to that1 F obtains <br>
or that1 F exists. A perceptual representation of the form that1 cubical body, where it is <br>
understood that cubical functions to betoken an instance of <i>cubical</i>, can be expanded to <br>
that1 body is cubical. The copula ‘is’ marks the expanded content as propositional.<br>
<br>
In a sense, the two forms carry the same information. But differences in form <i>matter</i> <br>
psychologically. Form helps type-individuate psychological states and competencies. <br>
Understanding the natures of the psychological states and competencies is my aim. <br>
Components of form are aspects of kinds of psychological states and psychological com-<br>
petencies. The referential rather than propositional form of perceptual states corresponds <br>
to their basic function and to the competencies that they exercise.<br>
<br>
All propositional structures contain a component that does not occur in the cor res-<br>
pond ing noun-phrase-like structures. Propositional structures always have a main-verb-<br>
phrase-like element. An occurrence of such an element always outranks or <br>
scope-dominates any singular elements in the structure. One can regard quantifiers as </div>
