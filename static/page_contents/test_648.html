endogenous attention, grounded in frontal eye fields (FEF), arrives in V4. Such attention is <br>
often influenced by long-term memory (LTM) of past perception and past conation. (See <br>
Chapter 15, the section Perceptual-Level Attention Commands and <br>
Guidance of Saccades.) After 150 ms, shape representation and categorization that <br>
depends on it are directly affected by input from perceptual memory, and further input <br>
from task-relevant endogenous attention, grounded prominently in parietal areas. (See <br>
Chapter 11, the section Timing of Visual Processing; Some Main Types of <br>
Representation; Chapter 13, the section Richer Perceptual Categorization <br>
and Perceptual Processing that Contributes to It; Chapter 17, the  section <br>
Ability-General Long-Term Visual Perceptual Memory.)<br>
<br>
All visual processing serves relatively primitive action, via conative states. (See <br>
Chapter 14.) There remains a sense, developed in this chapter, in which all this input stays <br>
within the visual system, and is perceptual-level. The visuo-motor system is similar. It <br>
includes the visual system. It takes input from that system and other perceptual modalities <br>
to guide action. The visuo-motor system is perceptual-level. What unify each system are <br>
function, content, and computational nature of the processing. Causal relations between <br>
supra-perceptual-level states, including propositional states, and perceptual-level states in <br>
these systems add no new functions to the latter states and have not been shown to ground <br>
computational explanation.<br>
<br>
The second theme is development of a conception of relations between perception and <br>
perceptual-level capacities, on one hand, and “cognitive” capacities, on the other. I take the <br>
distinction between perceptual-level and cognitive states and operations to be an im port-<br>
ant divide between psychological natural kinds.<br>
<br>
A large issue regarding relations between perceptual-level capacities and cognition is <br>
whether cognition “penetrates” perception. The issue has been advertised as momentous <br>
for epistemology. I think this advertisement misleading. The main import of the issue is its <br>
potential for clarifying psychological natural kinds—the architecture of lower representa-<br>
tional mind.<br>
<br>
The dispute has had worse drawbacks than mere misadvertisement. It has been rife <br>
with confusion about what a perceptual system is, what cognition is, and what counts as <br>
penetration. Not only philosophical writing, but even scientific writing, is beset with ser-<br>
ious terminological and conceptual unclarity about basic terms of the dispute. For <br>
ex ample, as I have been indicating in Chapters 13–18, much that has been counted cogni-<br>
tion simply is not. It is not supra-perceptual. I aim to encourage more disciplined ter min-<br>
ology and more fruitful uses of key concepts.<br>
<br>
I think that there are clear cases in which cognition—conceived for the moment as <br>
propositional capacities—indirectly causally affects perception both before stimulus onset <br>
and during stages of perceptual processing just after formation of the first perceptual rep-<br>
resentations, and after the first categorizations. Causal effect is not the only relevant notion <br>
of penetration.<br>
<br>
The points in Chapters 13–18, including a sense of what cognition is <i>not</i>, support con-<br>
ceiving the perceptual system as larger than it is widely taken to be, at least by philo-<br>
sophers. It is certainly richer than “early vision”, taken as encompassing only <br>
pre-categorizing perceptual attribution. (See Chapter 11.) That limitative view has been <br>
decisively revised in the science since the 1990s. The visual perceptual system is also richer <br>
than what is encompassed in the first, dominantly feed-forward sweep. It includes </div>
