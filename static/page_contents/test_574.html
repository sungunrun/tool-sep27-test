averaged 4.5 letters for a 12-letter display. However, if an individual was asked to report <br>
only one of the rows (partial report), where the row was indicated to the individual <i>only <br>
after the offset of the display</i> (say, by a tone indicating top, middle, or bottom row), the <br>
individual averaged over 3 letters correct, out of a maximum 4. See Figure 16.1.<br>
<br>
Given the unpredictability of which row would be cued, and given other facts of timing, <br>
which seem to undermine other explanations,827 it is widely accepted that subjects have <br>
available in memory (but not accessible to free, uncued report) an average of 9–10.5 letters <br>
from the original display of 12. The difference between the 4.5 letters available to free, <br>
uncued report (‘full report’) and partial report (of one row cued after stimulus offset) is <br>
known as <i>partial report superiority</i>.<br>
<br>
Sperling showed that cues could be delayed up to 300 ms after stimulus offset and prod-<br>
uce partial report superiority. His exhibiting partial report superiority is the main evidence <br><br>

proposes that because of the possibility of post-diction the standard interpretation of the partial reports is under-<br>
mined. Phillips provides no evidence that post-diction (influence of slightly later events on how a seemingly earlier <br>
occurring event is processed) is involved in the Sperling partial report paradigm. Moreover, cases of post-diction are <br>
mostly shorter than 300 ms, while partial report superiority goes on longer. I think Phillips’s proposal incompatible <br>
with empirical facts. Phillips doubts that unconscious perception ever occurs. I think this position very doubtful. See <br>
his debate with N. Block, ‘Unconscious Seeing’, in B. Nanay ed., <i>Current Controversies in Philosophy of Perception</i> (New <br>
York: Routledge, 2016). Phillips has repeatedly misrepresented me as holding that all perception is necessarily by indi-<br>
viduals, ignoring the more nuanced view that I made quite explicit in Origins of Objectivity. See note 16 above. On the <br>
other hand, I think him right to criticize me for having taken blindseers to clearly exhibit perceptual constancies. See <br>
his contribution to the discussion, M. Peters, R. Kentridge, I. Phillips, and N. Block, ‘Does Unconscious Perception <br>
Really Exist? Continuing the ASSC20 Debate’, <i>Neuroscience of Consciousness</i> 3 (2017), 1–11. There are, however, good <br>
specific reasons to believe that there are many cases of unconscious perception. For two of many surveys of evidence of <br>
unconscious perception, see Kouider and Dehaene, ‘Levels of Processing During Non-Conscious Perception: A <br>
Critical Review of Visual Masking’; Axelrod, Bar, and Rees, ‘Exploring the Unconscious Using Faces’.X<br><br>
