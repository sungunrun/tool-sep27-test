criticism of rejections of (aa1) and (aa2) 153</div>
<br><br>
The next step in the argument does not help matters: ‘The point generalizes to percep-<br>
tion: We can successfully single out an object in perception even if we get its location, <br>
color, texture, and a whole range of other properties wrong.’ (See note 162 again.) We <i>can</i> <br>
get all <i>those things</i> wrong and perceive an object. Schellenberg neglects to mention that I <br>
have made this very point repeatedly. She does not try to show that <i>all</i> perceptual attribu-<br>
tions can be wrong, while perceptual reference succeeds. I think that one cannot perceive <br>
a body or cloud (examples of objects), unless one correctly perceives it as having a con-<br>
nected outer boundary.168<br>
<br>
As remarked in the discussion of Pylyshyn and Fodor, being able to track a body by its <br>
continuing outer-boundary connecteness—also a condition on perceiving something as a <br>
body—requires tracking generic shape. The same applies to surfaces. Perception of other <br>
particulars, such as color-shade tropes, depends partly on attributing generic properties. <br>

Taxonomic Hierarchies in PercePtion.)<br><br>

<b>FOOTNOTES</b><br>
<b>Cont FN</b>None showed or tried to show that no guiding attributive need be true of a named object. They showed that <br>
associated attributives frequently do not suffice to pick out the referent, not that reference can succeed without <br>
any attributives at all. Only Donnellan considers the matter, and then only briefly. He raises the question whether <br>
Aristotle could have turned out to be Plato’s dog (or one might add, a pet rock of one of Plato’s friends). Keith <br>
Donnellan writes:<br><br>
If anyone wants to maintain that our use of the name [‘Aristotle’] is such that being a human being or <br>
<br>
not living in modern times, etc. are <i>necessary</i> for being the referent of the name, I have no objection <br>
<br>
here to offer against a ‘backing of descriptions’ in that weaker sense. Such an attenuated backing <br>
<br>
would not <i>uniquely</i> identify the referent.<br><br>
Donnellan, ‘Proper Names and Identifying Descriptions’, 346. The answer to the question that Donnellan <br>
raises for proper names is not simple. I have discussed the issue in some detail, in Burge, ‘Descartes, Bare <br>
Concepts, and Anti-Individualism: Reply to Normore’, section V; Burge, ‘Five Theses on <i>De Re</i> States and <br>
Attitudes’, 290–291. Proper names are, I think, a very special case. The case has features, such as social chains in <br>
which one can rely on descriptions of others, that are absent in perception. Reference with proper names is fre-<br>
quently non-autonomous. All reference in perception is autonomous: it does not depend on others’ reference. I <br>
think that analogs of (AA2) apply in all autonomous cases. In any case, Schellenberg seriously mis-describes <br>
what Kripke, Donnellan, Marcus showed about reference.<br>
<br>
168 I discuss this issue at some length in passages that Schellenberg fails to cite. See, for example, Burge, ‘Five <br>
Theses on <i>De Re</i> States and Attitudes’, 291–292:<br><br>
It is clear that an individual and his perceptual system can mistake nearly all features of an entity, <br>
<br>
yet still succeed in perceiving (and thinking about) the entity. Color, texture, shape, surface properties, <br>
<br>
spatial location, size, motion, and sortal type can be misperceived—all in a given instance. Yet the <br>
<br>
individual, animal or person can still see an object that is appropriately causally related to the percep-<br>
<br>
tual representation. For example, one can see an entity through an unknown prismatic distortion and <br>
<br>
have so limited a view that one gets its shape, color, location, and sortal type wrong. One can see <br>
<br>
something as an object with a definite surface, whereas it is in fact a coherently formed wisp of fog or <br>
<br>
strikingly salient beam of light, perhaps a hologram. One can form mistaken beliefs about <i>that</i> entity.<br>
<br>
There are, however, limits on how mistaken a perception can be while still having a perceptual ref-<br>
<br>
erent. I conjecture, for example, that to be visually perceived, an object must produce a representation <br>
<br>
that discriminates it from the surround and represents it correctly as having an approximately <br>
<br>
bounded shape that is in fact trackable in generic form. The specific shape might be misperceived. But <br>
<br>
if the object is seen, its shape must bear some systematic relation to the specific presented shape (such <br>
<br>
as being a bounded deformation of it).<br>
<br>
Suppose that light comes from an odd angle. Its reflection off particles in the air causes a represen-<br>
<br>
tation as of an object as straight ahead. Suppose that neither the light nor the particles form any <br>
<br>
coherent, trackable shape analogous to the apparently trackable shape of the apparent object. The <br>
<br>
light is not a flash with a shape that is a deformation of the shape represented, nor is it a hologram. <br>
<br>
Then I think neither the light nor the dispersed par ticles are perceptual referents, with misperceived <br>
<br>
features. They are not seen at all. There is only perceptual referential illusion . . . <br><br>
