410 Intra-Saccadic Perception and Recurrent Processing</div>

characterized as beginning with separate processing of information from local areas of the <br>
retinal image. It was taken then to proceed by serially combining such information into <br>
increasingly complex types of registration or representation that are increasingly relevant <br>
to distal stimuli. Only after the stage of the 2½-D sketch were inputs from attention, <br>
 memory, and so on, regarded as significant. Since the 1990s, this picture has shifted. <br>
As explained in Chapter 10, some processing largely driven by proximal stimuli goes <br>
beyond the limits of any postulated 2½-D sketch and yields categorization of 3-D objects. <br>
Second, even at early stages, visual processing is not entirely bottom-up.<br>
<br>
<i>Very</i> broadly, earlier temporal stages of visual processing are still thought to be more <br>
proximal-stimulus-driven, and later stages take input from more sources. <i>Very</i> broadly, <br>
more fine-grained, more global representations of distal stimuli are taken to be formed <br>
after coarser, more local registrations of proximal stimuli. But there are loops. Earlier <br>
stages of processing are reprocessed and refined as later stages come into play.<br>
<br>
Up to the first 100–150 ms after retinal stimulus onset, many operations work in paral-<br>
lel on local areas of the retinal image. After 150 ms, different operations apply to different <br>
locations in the internal retinotopic or topographic maps, depending on the local results <br>
of the initial parallel operations. The dominance of feed-forward mechanisms recedes. <br>
There is time for wider feedback loops in the visual system proper. They support filling in <br>
initial gist representations and making <i>more</i> specific the representations for specific-shaped <br>
bodies (such as animal-shaped, animal-body, and face). The first perceptual constancies <br>
and categorizations are strengthened and supplemented.<br>
<br>
By 150–200 ms, not only attribution of superordinate categories, like <i>animal-body</i>, <br>
but attribution of basic categories like <i>dog</i>-<i>body</i> and subordinate categories, like <i>poodle-<br>
body</i>, emerge. Recognition-level categorizations (often called “identifications”)—that is, <br>
categorization-discriminations between instances of subordinate categories, like differ-<br>
ently shaped (but poodle-shaped) poodle-bodies, by more fine-grained attributives—are <br>
effected via fillings-in. More properties and relations—and more specific properties and <br>
relations—are represented in this interval.<br>
<br>
Much endogenous attention effects processing at this stage and later. Some endogenous <br>
attention, however, has its effects in the 80–150 ms range. Even earlier attention-effects are <br>
primarily driven by the external stimulus. Although recurrent processing occurs at all <br>
temporal stages, there is, after 150 ms, more scope for feedback from other parts of the <br>
perceptual system and from auxiliary systems, such as memory, and more time for such <br>
feedback to have its effects.<br>
<br>
These processes are so complex that a chapter could not do them even rough justice. <br>
I hope to describe large features of later formations of perceptual states—although the <br>
state of knowledge on these topics is not advanced. I make some points about psychological <br>
kinds, including criticisms of some scientific and philosophical thinking about later <br>
perception-formation.<br>
<br>
A lot of empirical work during the last 25 years has shown that a simple bottom-up <br>
picture is not tenable, even for the earliest stages of visual processing. There is <i>horizontal</i> <br>
input from different states within each level of processing. For example, in V1, the first <br>
cortical visual area, not only do neurons fire in response to proximal stimulation of the <br>
retina; they also fire in response to firing by other neurons in V1. These firings function at <br>
the level of pre-perceptual sensory registration. Further, there is input from non-visual <br>
modalities, such as hearing and proprioception. There is input from sources traditionally </div>
