Absence in Perception of Logical Constants 193</div>
<br><br>
Perceptual memory functions to preserve perceptual representation. Most perceptual <br>
memory does not preserve all of a perception’s representational content. To be perceptual, <br>
memory must function to preserve some of past perception’s contents, and no non-<br>
perceptual contents. I think that perceptual memory no more contains logical operators <br>
than perception does.<br>
<br>
There is in perceptual memory nearly always some <i>loss</i> of some specifics in the percep-<br>
tion from which it derives. One type of loss, especially in long-term memory, is actual <br>
reference to particulars. I call this type of memory ‘<i>ability-general long-term memory</i>’. <br>
(See Chapter 17.) A great deal of long-term perceptual memory is ability-general. Ability-<br>
general long-term memory represents past particulars only schematically, without refer-<br>
ential applications.<br>
<br>
One might think that such memory engages in the abstraction that existential quantifi-<br>
cation engages in. Because long-term perceptual memory might lose its occurrence-based <br>
applications to formerly perceived particulars and retain memory only of <i>an</i> F, one might <br>
be tempted to conceive of <i>an</i> as the logical operation of quantification of the attributive <br>
F. An animal may forget the particular bone that it perceived on any given occasion in a <br>
certain area, but retain a perceptual memory as of gnawable body of a certain shape and <br>
size in the area. Is this existential quantification?<br>
<br>
I think not. In the first place, existential quantification is a propositional operation. <br>
Merely losing occurrence-based applications (context-dependent references to particulars) <br>
in perceptual memory cannot yield propositional structure. A propositional structure <br>
requires a main verb phrase. More importantly, removing the context-dependent applica-<br>
tion of a determiner in a noun-phrase leaves one with a schematic noun-phrase, not a <br>
quantified structure.<br>
<br>
Contrast a drawing of a particular bone based on causal relation to it with a drawing <br>
that is not of any particular bone. The second drawing is informed by experience of par-<br>
ticular bones. Its links to such past experiences are forgotten, or otherwise not used. The <br>
drawing’s iconic character requires that it represent a bone as having a specific shape. <br>
Other features—size, color, and so on—might be abstracted from, and not specifically rep-<br>
resented. No particular bone is represented.<br>
<br>
One might take the drawing as a mock representation of a particular bone, with the <br>
background knowledge that no such particular bone is represented. Then the representa-<br>
tion would be more like a drawing of Santa Claus. There is no actual referent, but there is a <br>
referential application. Generic perceptual memory does not represent in that way. It does <br>
not represent as if a definite particular is represented. Rather it represents schematically. <br>
The representation does not fail by lacking a singular referent; it does not succeed by <br>
generalizing.<br>
<br>
The form of the representational content of the generic drawing remains noun-phrase-<br>
like, indeed, I think, singular. The form is that body with such and such a [specific depicted] <br>
shape, with no application of that to any particular body or bone. It does not fail its func-<br>
tion by lacking a singular referent. The drawing also does not fulfill its function by gener-<br>
alizing. The drawing contains no generalization operating on an attributive.<br>
<br>
All representational elements in the drawing that indicate attributes (shape, bodihood, <br>
bonehood) are used to depict in a singular way. All attributives are associated with the <br>
form of a representation of a particular bone. The drawing’s iconic nature requires it to <br>
have the schematic <i>form</i> of reference to a particular. Although the schema is not </div>
