Attention Commands and Guidance of Saccades 551</div>
<br><br>
endogenous attention is input in response to a stimulus, not primarily an aspect of the <br>
reception of the stimulus. Neither exogenous nor endogenous attention need be con-<br>
scious. Neither need have cognitive, supra-perceptual-level, initiations.<br>
<br>
Two types of endogenous attention initiation are supported in FEF. One type is non-<br>
representational, although it causes attentional effects on perceptual representation sup-<br>
ported in V4, and may also cause representational attention commands supported in V4. The <br>
other type of attention initiation is representational. That is, the initiation representationally <br>
targets what areas or entities are to receive attention. Hence it is an attention command.<br>
<br>
Take the first type. The neurons that initiate endogenous attention in response to retinal <br>
signals do not exhibit selectivity for color, direction of motion, or orientation in many <br>
cases.787 In such cases, it is not plausible that attention initiations supported in FEF repre-<br>
sent entities in the distal environment, in the sense of ‘represent’ that I have been using. <br>
They register items on a retinal map. Then, FEF attention initiations are not attention <br>
commands, just functional causes of endogenous attention.<br>
<br>
These low-level attention initiations are, however, commonly modulated by perceptual-<br>
level memories of task-relevant conative representational states. These antecedent conative <br>
states are the sorts of states that initiate relatively primitive action—discussed in Chapter 14. <br>
So non-representational attention initiations supported in FEF can have perceptual-level <br>
representational causal antecedents. Such attention initiations also have perceptual, hence <br>
representational, states as effects. When the attention impulses initiated in FEF enter V4, <br>
they support selection of perceptual resources. In effect, FEF attention initiation prompts a <br>
match supported in V4 between the low-level pre-representational stimulus feature (co-<br>
varying best with some feature of the retinal image) with some perceptual representation <br>
already produced, or being produced, in V4. For example, a retinal edge line could be <br>
matched with a representation as of a surface with a corresponding environmental edge <br>
line. Relevant exercises of attentional capacities, initiated in FEF, may perhaps be selected <br>
and boosted in V4. So, some attention initiations consist in non-representational causes of <br>
selection for enhancement of non-perceptual information registrations.<br>
<br>
Now for the second type of attention initiation grounded in FEF. Discovered twice, ser-<br>
endipitously, neuron firings in FEF that support attention <i>are</i> sometimes selective for dis-<br>
tal environmental properties: color and surface-shape with orientation. In the view of the <br>
key discoverer, similar results will be found for size and 3-D volume shape, which have not <br>
yet been tested for. These cases occur when subjects have been trained to find a stimu lus. <br>
In the cases tested, a long-term perceptual memory affects the structures in FEF, orient ing <br>
them toward a task. So when subjects are given prior training for task orientation, repre-<br>
sentational attention initiations are perceptually guided. They count as en dogen ous atten-<br>
tion commands—representational events that select representation as of an environmental <br>
attribute for extra resources.788<br><br>
