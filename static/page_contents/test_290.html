conscious, then the memory’s shape and body attributives, would not be the same as those <br>
in the original perception, although they would be derived from them and would share <br>
indicants with them.<br>
<br>
The body attributive gets its mode of presentation partly from the shape attributive: the <br>
look of the body derives largely from the look (grounded mainly in the orientation and <br>
distance) of the shape by which it is identified. The superscripts on attributives signal spe-<br>
cific modes of presentation—specific attributives. The numbers in the superscripts are <br>
arbitrary. But I have used the same numbers on the shape and body attributives in the <br>
superscript markers, just for this case as illustration, to signal the fact that the body <br>
at tribu tives derive their modes of presentation partly from the shape attributives. Of <br>
course, the modes of presentation of the two types of attributive are never the same. They <br>
have different psychological connections and determine different indicants. Such general <br>
differences are marked by the superscripts ‘b’ and ‘d’.<br>
<br>
I assume that bodyd6 and LocL are shared among all three states. In the conative and <br>
memory states, those attributives derive from attributions with the same indicants in the <br>
perception. I have tried to capture <i>duration magnitude n in the past with respect to now</i> <br>
with (then t2 – n), where t2 is the present time of the visual memory. The bird’s memory <br>
sets off the timer at time t1. So t2 – n = t1. The formalizations (then t2 – n) and LocL are <br>
meant to suggest (in short-hand ways) framework-type, iconic attributives, which plot the <br>
duration-magnitude and the position in 3-D space respectively. Food-sourcen6(c)(xa1, t3) <br>
has the content xa1 being food sourcen6 at t3. The functional attributives are probably per-<br>
ceptual attributives in both perceptual and conation systems. If they are not, they at least <br>
occur in the conation system.<br>
<br>
I assume that at the time of the conative command, the bird is in a different position <br>
(xp2) than it was in when it previously perceived the flower. I assume that the bird has <br>
some computational mechanism that works with memory to enable the bird to represent <br>
and navigate back to the location of the flower from the new far-away position xp2. <br>
I assume that the visual memory together with the timing mechanisms in the memory <br>
immediately cause the issuing of the command, the conative state, after a fixed temporal <br>
from after the original visual perception (and the flight elsewhere). So the conative state <br>
has an ego-present that is after the present time in the memory state. The attributive fly-<br>
to(c)(xa1) has the obvious reading. As with avoid(c), I leave open the form of the use at tribu-<br>
tive. Both are placeholders for a more detailed analysis. For more detailed analysis of <br>
action attributives, see Chapter 12. I think that the contents of the action attributives <br>
derive from proprioception, but perhaps they first emerge only in the conative system.<br>
<br>
Note that the initial perception, the memory, and the conative state have the same refer-<br>
ential applications, for the shape-instance (xg2) and the body (xa1), because I am suppos-<br>
ing, for simplicity, that the counterpart applications in the memory state and conative <br>
state are each anaphorically connected to the applications in the perception. That is, I am <br>
supposing that the memory state and conative state depend for their referential applica-<br>
tions back to perceived entities <i>entirely</i> on counterpart referential applications in the <br>
 ori gin al perception that caused them. The original perceptual state sets up a tracking <br>
mechanism to be retained in a memory index file (marked by superscript ‘a’). All three <br>
states contribute to this tracking. By the time a flower that is supposed to be tracked is <br>
next perceived, a new perceptual referential application (with a new subscript, but still the </div>
