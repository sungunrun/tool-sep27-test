modified via experience, the differences cluster around a basic, default spatio-temporal <br>
pattern in causing an impression of causation.578<br>
<br>
An experiment that convinced scientists that infants represent collision events as causal <br>
showed infants to be sensitive to the asymmetry of causal events. They assign distinct roles <br>
to the causing object and the affected object. They do not do so for event-pairs that follow <br>
one another regularly, but do not engage in causal interaction. Infants’ responses distin-<br>
guish merely predicted patterns of motion relations between objects from patterns that <br>
involve causal relations.<br>
<br>
Alan Leslie and Stephanie Keeble habituated 6-month-olds to Michottian launching or <br>
collision events. They habituated another group to similar events with a temporal delay <br>
between the end of the approaching object’s movement and the beginning of the receding <br>
object’s movement. In both cases, the originally stationary object, <i>b</i>, moves after the <br>
approaching object, <i>a</i>, moves. Only in the first case do adults judge the relation to be <br>
causal. In test trials, Leslie and Keeble reversed the order and direction of the events. Thus <br>
for both groups of infants, in test trials, object <i>b</i> moves first; then object <i>a</i> moves. In <br>
reversing the causal event, the roles of the objects change. Object <i>b</i> becomes the causal <br>
entity; object <i>a</i> becomes the affected entity. Infants remained habituated when the motions <br>
were reversed with the temporal gap between them. They dishabituated when the causal, <br>
collision event was reversed. This result showed minimally that infants’ representations of <br>
collision events are not centered on predictable type and temporal order of motion. They <br>
are tuned to an asymmetry that seems to be causal.579 See Figure 12.2.<br>
<br>
This distinction in role is, I believe, one of the earliest sources of thematic roles that <br>
come to dominate the structure of early propositional representation—including the first <br>
sentences of human children. Tracing development of this structure is important in <br>
understanding early language and propositional thought. This structure probably ori gin-<br>
ates in perception.<br>
<br>
There is now considerable agreement that adults and infants represent relevant events <br>
as causal in these experiments. The adults say that they do. The infants’ dishabituation <br>
responses track causation very well. Although most dishabituation tests are on 2-D dis-<br>
plays, it is agreed that infants use representational capacities molded by interaction with <br>
3-D causal events. There is no known good account for why these specific patterns of <br>
movement would be grouped as significant and distinctive by children other than that the <br>
patterns are instances of causation.580<br><br>
