introspection. But as has long been assumed in studying language, representational prop-<br>
erties must be understood by focusing on underlying capacities shown in their functions, <br>
uses, and causal patterns.<br>
<br>
The key perceptual representational capacities are a capacity to refer to environmental <br>
particulars, via causal chains from the particulars to an occurrent perceptual state, and a <br>
capacity to attribute attributes to referred-to particulars. (See Chapter 2, the section The <br>
Three Fundamental Representational Constituents in Perceptual <br>
States.) These capacities are always exercised together in perception. (See Chapter 5.) <br>
They induce a representational form that is like that of a noun-phrase governed by an <br>
applied demonstrative-like determiner. Application of the determiner and attribution by <br>
the guiding attributives are effected occurrently—by the causal triggering of the percep-<br>
tual state. (See Chapter 2, the section The Basic Representational Form of <br>
Perceptual States; and Chapter 6.)<br>
<br>
The basic semantics for this form of representation is simply stated: the perceptual state <br>
is accurate if and only if all referential applications succeed in referring to (perceived) <br>
particulars and all attributives that guide them are accurate of those particulars. Detailed <br>
working-out of the form is, however, complex. Stupendous numbers of perceptual referen-<br>
tial applications and perceptual attributives occur in any normal perceptual state. (See <br>
Chapters 6–9.) The size of an educated adult’s passive linguistic vocabulary is about 50,000 <br>
words. The number of attributive capacities in a human visual system that can be exer-<br>
cised at any given time, without acquiring more, is at least in the billions, perhaps trillions. <br>
Quite possibly, these estimates and those just below are overly conservative. Color, shape, <br>
size, position, speed, and other perceptual discriminatory capacities boggle the im agin-<br>
ation. Grouping adds more. In most perceptual states, exercised attributives may run well <br>
into the millions. Billions of particulars are perceived, picked out by different referential <br>
applications, in any given perceptual state. (See Figure 9.2.) The iconic format of percep-<br>
tion makes these numbers vivid, and manageable.<br>
<br>
Attributives are applied at different levels of abstraction. Spatial and temporal frame-<br>
works inject indexical referential applications. There are many perceptual attributives, in <br>
any given individual’s perceptual system, for any given attribute that is attributed. <br>
Connections among these attributives in tracking or in perceptual constancies is a subtle <br>
matter. Attention affects scope priority and even representational content.<br>
<br>
Perceptual representational contents are orders of magnitude “bigger” than contents <br>
of propositional thoughts that do not themselves contain iconic conceptualizations of <br>
 perceptual contents. The basic elements of the form are, however, few. There are two kinds <br>
of referential applications–those that function to pick out perceived particulars, and those <br>
that establish indexical-like anchors for spatial or temporal frameworks. Schemas for <br>
such applications are competencies to exercise them. And there are perceptual attributives <br>
that either function to characterize perceived particulars or function to characterize the <br>
anchors. All forms of perceptual-level representational content—all forms of occurrent <br>
perceptual-level psychological states—are permutations of these three kinds of represen-<br>
tational elements.<br>
<br>
The distinctive representational function of perception is to pick out particulars. In ful-<br>
filling this function, it must apply perceptual attributives. (See Chapter 5.) The referential <br>
applications always scope dominate the perceptual attributives. (See Chapter 2, the section <br>
The Basic Representational Form of Perceptual States.) In many states </div>
