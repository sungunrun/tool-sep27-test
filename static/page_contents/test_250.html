and Quantifiers.) That is, there is a representational failure if a later tracking referen-<br>
tial application does not pick out a particular picked out by the initial referential applica-<br>
tion. Of course, the committal function does not imply an intentional commitment, much <br>
less a conscious one. Being committal marks a representational function for a perceptual <br>
state, in this case the tracking function. The function helps determine the form of the state <br>
and the conditions for its representational success.235<br>
<br>
The fallible commitment to tracking a particular over time involves a relation between <br>
perceptual states and a perceptual memory file that functions to connect the perceptual <br>
states. Each perceptual state and the memory file have different referential applications <br>
that function to contribute to picking out one particular.236 The content of a perceptual <br>
memory file is scope-dominated by a referential application. Any perceptual state that <br>
functions to contribute to the tracking could in principle fail to do so. The referential <br>
application of the memory file is thus not normally infallibly guaranteed to have the same <br>
referent as a perception that functions to track the same particular as previous perceptions <br>
that function to feed the file. Even when different perceptions and the memory file suc-<br>
ceed in tracking a particular, and their referential applications share a referent, there is no <br>
logical guarantee that they do so. So the various referential applications are normally not <br>
identical—not anaphorically connected. A memory file can maintain a referent even if <br>
some of the tracking perceptual states that function to feed it do not have the same refer-<br>
ent as others. I suppose that the referent of the file is whatever particular best grounds <br>
partial success in tracking, even if there are tracking failures by some perceptual states in <br>
the tracking operation. Memory files can split into two. They can fail to have a referent if <br>
tracking is too defective. A memory file can in principle refer to a particular even if it is <br>
not the first one picked out, if tracking the first particular fails, but another particular is <br>
well tracked. I will not explore detailed conditions for determining the referent of a singu-<br>
lar memory file.<br>
<br>
The root of these ideas is formalized by taking referential applications in perceptual <br>
states that function to track a single particular to have a common file marker. The marker <br>
stands for the diachronic linkage of referential applications as functioning to track the <br>
particular (if any) that the initial one picks out. This marker is present in the memory file <br>
that unifies the tracking that different perceptual states are linked in functioning to engage <br>
in. Tracking is present in object constancies. The functional unification is a loose analog of <br>
linkage among states in a perceptual attribute constancy—except that linkage of at tribu-<br>
tives for an attribute does not necessarily connect occurrent exercises and is not really <br>
itself a tracking. It is a systematic, ability-general competence unified in indication of one <br>
attribute.<br><br>

<b>FOOTNOTES</b><br>
<b>Cont FN</b>235 One might consider postulating a perceptual attributive for an identity relation. The attributive would dif-<br>
fer from the identity predicate in the displayed formula (a´-b´) in never functioning as a main verb phrase. The <br>
scope of the referential applications of body would always outrank the scope of the identity attributive. Such <br>
a postulation may not controvert any deep principle. It could be used to provide explicit accuracy conditions in <br>
tracking particulars. I think, however, that it is not psychologically plausible. In perceptual analogs of (a´-b´), <br>
a tracked particular does not seem to be presented in perception as bearing some relation to itself. Tracking is a <br>
fallible but reliable capacity that accords with principles of transition. It does not require a further representa-<br>
tional content. (See Chapter 4, the section Principles Governing Transitions Contrasted with <br>
Representational Contents.)<br>
