The distinctiveness of perceptual attributives is discussed at length in <i>Origins of <br>
Objectivity</i>.156 I think that their account is out of touch with how perceptual psychology <br>
postulates attribution. It appeals to attribution in perception not in terms of its role in <br>
propositional states or by reference to a language of thought, but in terms of perceptual <br>
competencies to respond to specific attributes, competencies embedded in perceptual <br>
constancies.<br>
<br>
Pylyshyn and Fodor’s primary argument for attributive-or characterization-<br>
independent reference in perception rests on the point that most properties of a perceived <br>
object that are most salient from the armchair—specific color, specific shape, and so on—<br>
can change, unnoticed in object tracking; yet tracking succeeds.157 The argument over-<br>
looks generic properties, such as outer-boundary connectedness, that are necessary for <br>
perception of the tracked objects and are constant through tracking. Perceptual tracking <br>
of bodies is known to fail if one cannot track them by their outer-boundary connected-<br>
ness. Perception of something as a body is associated with an anticipation of continuity of <br>
outer-boundary connectedness over time, or “cohesion”.158 Of course, tracking allows for <br>
occlusions and other disappearances. Pylyshyn and Fodor never seriously confront the <br>
question how an object could be perceptually picked out without doing so partly by way of <br>
some <i>perceivable</i> characteristic. Nor do they reflect on what a perceptual competence <br>
would be in the absence of attributing types of particulars.<br>
<br>
Pylyshyn sometimes acknowledges that in picking out an object, a perceptual system <br>
responds to environmental spatial properties. He also notes that proximal counterparts of <br>
some properties (such as retinal edges, gradients, and the like) are coded in the perceptual <br>
system. He denies that such codings are concepts. But he explicitly denies that any repre-<br>
sentations of object properties are used in perceptual tracking or perceptually picking out <br>
of objects. This position ignores the central topic of vision sciences—explaining how <br>
repeatable <i>perceptual</i> responses (perceptual attributives) are formed in response to en vir-<br>
on men tal attributes that are used in picking out particulars. (See citations in note 138.)<br>
<br>
Pylyshyn and Fodor write metaphorically of an object’s grabbing a demonstrative. They <br>
never cash the metaphor. They never explain how the “grabbing” occurs.<br>
<br>
Further, they write:<br><br>
The visual system cannot apply property-at-location encoding without first identifying <br>
<br>
the object to which the properties are ascribed: so it cannot escape individuating objects <br>
<br>
<i>before</i> it decides which properties belong to which object. Berkeley was wrong to think <br>
<br>
that objects are bundles of tokens of properties; rather, as Locke thought, they are the <br>
<br>
individuals to which properties (locations included) belong. The way this is believed to <br>
<br>
work, according to Feature-Integration Theory . . . is that in order to encode conjunctions <br>
<br>
of properties, one must first pick out the object that has the conjunctions and allocate <br>
<br>
attention to it in order to judge that the properties belong to the same object; otherwise <br>
<br>
one makes frequent “conjunction errors.”159<br><br>
