occurrences—those that occur in presently sustained perceptual beliefs. Occurrences of <br>
the pairs in memory and conation (perceptual memory and perceptual conation for the <br>
perceptual pair; conceptual memory and conceptual conation for the conceptual pair) do <br>
not have the function. Such functions are not intrinsic to <i>attributive types</i>. (See Chapter 2, <br>
the section The Three Fundamental Representational Constituents in <br>
Perceptual States; Chapter 6, the section Betokening and Four Types of <br>
Perceptual Attribution; and note 199.)<br>
<br>
To get the contrast needed to distinguish the function of conceptual from perceptual <br>
attributives, one needs to hold that <i>in themselves</i>, in every occurrence, perceptual attribu-<br>
tives function occurrently to be causally sustained by present stimulation. But in fact, both <br>
perceptual and conceptual attributives can occur in modes or in state-instances in which <br>
the attributives do not function to be sustained by present proximal stimulation. Both can <br>
occur in memory and anticipation, for example. And as noted, both can occur in states <br>
that do function to be sustained by present proximal stimulation.<br>
<br>
It follows, however, from the amended line for distinguishing cognition from percep-<br>
tion that perceptual attributives cannot occur if they are not functioning to be sustained <br>
by present proximal stimulation. That consequence can seem plausible. One might think <br>
that a <i>perceptual</i> attributive would not be <i>perceptual</i> if it did not function occurrently to be <br>
sustained by present proximal stimulation. This reasoning conflates two notions of ‘per-<br>
ceptual’. One is occurring in a perception. The other is individuated by being produced by <br>
a perceptual system and constitutively functions to occur (sometimes) in perceptual states. <br>
Perceptual attributives are individuated in the latter way. Although they are produced by a <br>
perceptual system and constitutively function to occur in perceptual states, they can be <br>
preserved in non-perceptual states—memories, anticipations, imaginings. They constitu-<br>
tively function (sometimes) to guide conation.<br>
<br>
The idea that a perceptual attributive would not be perceptual if it did not function <br>
occurrently to be sustained by present proximal stimulation is a consequence of Beck’s <br>
reasoning. This consequence is scientifically unacceptable. Such an idea entails that no <br>
applications of <i>perceptual</i> attributives can be retained in memory. If having uses that do <br>
not occurrently function to be sustained by current proximal stimulation is sufficient for <br>
not being perceptual, and for being conceptual, then no perceptual attributive can be <br>
retained in memory—or occur in a conative state, such as an attentional command, or in <br>
an anticipatory representational state.<br>
<br>
Beck does cite memory as a cognitive state. One might think that the upshot is a wel-<br>
come consequence of the view. Or one might think that the dispute is just terminological. <br>
But attributives are psychological capacities that ground psychological explanation. The <br>
idea that every attributive representational content in a perceptual state cannot be retained <br>
in memory, but <i>must</i> be supplanted by another attributive representational content, is <br>
incompatible with well-established scientific explanation of retention relations between <br>
perceptual states and perceptual memory. Discussion in Chapters 14–18 showed that <br>
psych ology makes commitments about retention from perception that are incompatible <br>
with this idea.<br>
<br>
A further consequence of Beck’s view is that perceptual attributives cannot be instanti-<br>
ated in an unexercised competence in a given mind at a given time. But having a percep-<br>
tual attributive for <i>green</i> can be a presently unexercised competence to see something as <br>
green in a certain way. Instances of such competencies, are dispositional. They do not </div>
