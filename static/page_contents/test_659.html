Fodor and Pylyshyn’s Conceptions of Modularity 659</div>

conceptual.1069 I believe that he always had a confused and uninformed view of perception <br>
that is not perception of linguistic items. He never discussed ordinary perception in any <br>
detail or depth. This deficiency is compatible with his proposals about modularity being <br>
thought-provoking and fruitful.<br>
<br>
A decade and a half after Fodor’s book, in 1999, Zenon Pylyshyn wrote a landmark <br>
article that argued that <i>early vision</i> is impenetrable by cognitive factors. Pylyshyn does not <br>
fully articulate what constitutes early vision. The notion was and is not precise in the sci-<br>
ence. It is clear, however, that Pylyshyn takes early vision to include perceptual constancies <br>
for 3-D volume shape, but to exclude categorization.1070<br>
<br>
This position reflects only a minor modification of the outdated view that purely per-<br>
ceptual processing ends with a 2½-D sketch, discussed in Chapter 10. Pylyshyn, like those <br>
who influenced him, excluded categorization from early vision. Hence he excluded cat-<br>
egor iza tion from his claims of impenetrability. Like Fodor, Pylyshyn did not distinguish <br>
perceptual categorization from conceptual or cognitive categorization.<br>
<br>
As argued in Chapter 13, perceptual categorization does not mark a deep difference in <br>
processing or kind from attributions of shape. It is part of perceptual processing. Much <br>
subsequent discussion simply accepts Pylyshyn’s view that categorization is outside any <br>
perceptual module, and that categorization involves incursion by cognitive factors into <br>
visual processing. The point to be noticed is that what to count as the visual system—and <br>
what to count as cognition—are central to evaluating Pylyshyn’s points.<br>
<br>
Pylyshyn clarified several empirical issues. His argument that the early visual system is <br>
cognitively impenetrable was an advance on Fodor’s more generalized conception of <br>
modularity as a methodological tool for thinking about psychological kinds.<br>
<br>
Explicating cognitive penetration Pylyshyn writes:<br><br>
The sort of influence that concerns us here originates outside the visual system and affects <br>
<br>
the content of visual perception (what is seen) in a certain meaning-dependent way that <br>
<br>
we call cognitive penetration . . . if a system is cognitively penetrable then the function it <br>
<br>
computes is sensitive, in a semantically coherent way, to the organism’s goals and beliefs, <br>
<br>
that is, it can be altered in a way that bears some logical relation to what the per-<br>
<br>
son knows.1071<br><br>
Pylyshyn took up the less modest of Fodor’s notions of encapsulation. Pylyshyn defends <br>
Fodor’s view that cognition has no relevant influence at all.<br>
<br>
What influence counts as relevant for Pylyshyn? In the quote, Pylyshyn writes that cog-<br>
nitive penetrability requires sensitivity by the early visual system to the perceiver’s goals <br>
and beliefs ‘in a semantically coherent way’. He requires that penetration “make sense” in <br>
light of antecedent beliefs and goals. He requires cognitive penetrators to be ‘logically con-<br>
nected’ to the contents of perceptions. He takes principles of visual perception to differ <br>
from inferences among cognitive contents in that ‘in general they do not appear to <br><br>
