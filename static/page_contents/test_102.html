102 perceptual constancy</div>
<br><br>
There is significant variation in proximal stimulation deriving from particulars <i>in</i> space <br>
<br>
or time while there is a constant perceptual representation of <i>their</i> attributes as well as a <br>
<br>
given distance. And the constant distance-attribute is attributed in perception.<br><br>
For distance constancy, there can be significant variation in proximal stimulation in differ-<br>
ent instances when a given distance is attributed. The variation derives from different entities, <br>
or angles on entities, <i>in</i> space that are perceived or perceivable at a given distance. No vari-<br>
ations in proximal stimulation could be caused by the given distance alone. There remains <br>
large variation in proximal stimulation, as the given distance is perceptually attributed.<br>
<br>
A similar description applies to duration constancy. There can be significant variation <br>
in proximal stimulation, deriving from different particulars perceived, at the beginning of <br>
an interval, at the beginning and end, or through the interval. Yet an interval is attributed <br>
by a perception, where perception can be backed by perceptual memory or perceptual <br>
anticipation. The possible differences in proximal variation do not derive from the interval <br>
alone. They derive from perceived particulars that could cause different proximal stimula-<br>
tions. The timing mechanism can be the same one that operates in pre-perceptual capaci-<br>
ties. It can be set off either internally—independently of perception—or by perception of a <br>
particular. Perception of particulars may or may not occupy the attributed interval, as long <br>
as such perception marks an interval-boundary. What makes a perceptual timing mech an-<br>
ism <i>perceptual</i> is that it is co-opted by perception, and by capacities derivative from per-<br>
ception like perceptual memory, to attribute timings and temporal relations to perceived <br>
particulars. Perceptual constancy for a temporal relation depends on capacities to <i>per cep-<br>
tual ly</i> attribute it to perceived entities, despite possible differences in proximal stimulation <br>
deriving from perceived entities. Pre-perceptual registration of time can be objective in <br>
the loose sense that it functionally corresponds to objective passage of time. Inevitably, <br>
objectification of perceptual temporal attribution derives from objectification in attribu-<br>
tions to particulars other than times, in attribution of durations, temporal orderings, tem-<br>
poral cycles. It derives from perceptual attributions to perceived entities—particulars.<br>
<br>
Peacocke claims that there is temporal perception (which he misleadingly calls percep-<br>
tion of duration or perception of time) without perceptual constancies. He claims that in <br>
cases of ‘reliable correlation’ between the duration of a proximal stimulus and the duration <br>
of a distal event, there is temporal representation. He thinks that this fact shows that there <br>
are no perceptual constancies for temporal representation.<br>
<br>
Peacocke’s examples all concern a correlation between duration of proximal stimulus <br>
and duration of distal event that is purportedly represented. These are cases in which an <br>
entity does not change and something about it is timed, or in which there is perception of <br>
relatively close-up motion. These are not the only situations in which temporal representa-<br>
tion occurs. Durations are perceptually attributed to events perceived at various distances <br>
from one another and from the perceiver. In perceptual ordinal timing (before and after, <br>
without a specific duration), there is no direct correlation between duration of proximal <br>
stimulation and duration of a <i>representatum</i>. My characterization of temporal perceptual <br>
constancies covers these cases.<br>
<br>
What of the cases that Peacocke advances as counter-examples? The first of two cases is:<br><br>
 . . . perception of the whole duration of a temporally extended event, such as the sounding <br>
<br>
of a fire alarm bell . . . . In normal circumstances, extended proximal events of this kind </div>
