640 Perceptual Learning, Anticipation, Imagining</div>
<br><br>
I think it likely that no non-human animal meets the full panoply of conditions that <br>
Tulving and followers place on episodic memory and anticipatory representation. But <br>
there are almost certainly animals, including ones already investigated, that meet condi-<br>
tions for <i>de re</i> representation of particulars in long-term memory and long-term anticipa-<br>
tion. I think it possible that some of this representation retains some modes of presentation <br>
derived from given perceptions. So I think both episodic (long-term) memory—as I char-<br>
acterized it in Chapter 17—and the long-term anticipatory analog may well occur in <br>
higher animals, such as the lion and the scrub jay.<br>
<br>
To test for these states, one must distinguish between ability-general schematic long-<br>
term memory and anticipation, on one hand, and <i>de re</i> long-term memory and anticipa-<br>
tion that preserve some perceptual attributives on, on the other. To test for <i>de re</i> reference, <br>
one must determine whether the effect of a given causal chain can be retained in memory <br>
and used in anticipation. Neural evidence could support such a result. Broad psy cho phys-<br>
ic al theory regarding how reference chains are retained or lost could also support such <br>
a result.<br>
<br>
I return briefly to a more general issue about perceptual anticipation. Some scientists <br>
postulate a recurrent interchange at <i>every stage</i> of perceptual processing, including pre-<br>
representational stages, between states with an anticipatory function and states with the <br>
function of correcting discrepancies of received information from anticipated informa-<br>
tion. The line is called ‘<i>predictive coding</i>’. On this view, there is a cascade, at all levels of <br>
processing, of alternating error-detecting and predictive states. The predictive states <br>
receive input from the error-detecting states and modify their “predictions”, or anticipa-<br>
tory settings, accordingly. These psychological states are supposed to be implemented by <br>
populations of neurons that function to be predictive and error-detecting. Such pairs of <br>
states are taken to be pervasive and sequenced in a hierarchy.1019<br>
<br>
This type of explanation is sometimes presented as a completely general model for psy-<br>
chological processing, including perceptual processing. By contrast, some of the scientific <br>
work is targeted at particular problems and is scientifically serious.1020 At this stage, even <br>
the serious work is highly speculative and at the level of showing that such a scheme <i>could</i> <br>
work.1021 Some of the philosophical work that features predictive coding tends to exhibit a <br>
cheerleading-or missionary zeal that overplays the evidential status of the approach.1022<br>
<br>
In fact, predictive coding is still a minor movement in vision science. It is not dominant <br>
even in its natural home, study of the motor system. (See Chapter 14, the section Broader <br><br>
