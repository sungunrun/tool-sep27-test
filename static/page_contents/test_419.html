connections that subserve fine-grained distinctions among individual objects. The hippo-<br>
cam pus, in the temporal lobe, stores long-term memories including memories of places <br>
that are allocentrically mapped.513<br>
<br>
The parietal lobe includes the last stages in the dorsal stream. It receives input from MT <br>
and other lower areas, and from the temporal area. It initiates feedback to all these areas. <br>
It contains specializations for responding to motion and guiding navigation. The mapping <br>
of space that it enables is egocentrically anchored. The parietal lobe contains areas espe-<br>
cially responsive to objects perceived in near space, say, inside a meter. A major cue for <br>
locating objects is binocular disparity. Processing in the dorsal stream supports spatial <br>
constancies. The parietal lobe is also an important source of endogenous attentional <br>
 feedback to other areas, such as V1-V5 and IT.514<br>
<br>
Information from the last stages of both ventral and dorsal streams projects to the <br>
 pre-frontal cortex. Processing there, in the frontal eye fields (FEF), and also in parietal <br>
areas initiates task-dependent, endogenous attention. Attention selects targets, enhances <br>
processing for selected spatial regions, features, or objects, and suppresses processing for <br>
distractors. FEF controls eye movements and highlights targets for saccades. It also affects <br>
visual processing directly. Its applications of attention are faster than those from the par-<br>
ietal area. FEF contributes to figure-ground segregation and to shape representation that <br>
affects categorization at various levels of processing, in MT, V4, and IT.515 Much, but not <br>
all, of this feedback has its effects <i>after</i> the first burst of feed-forward activity that yields <br>
initial categorizations in IT. FEF <i>also supports part of the feed-forward process.</i> Stimulus <br>
signals reach it almost as fast as they reach MT (V5) and V1. It is thought that FEF affects <br>
V4 in feed-forward as well as feedback direction. This point is worth noting as an example <br>
of the fact that pre-frontal areas of the brain do not always support feedback, much less <br>
cognitive feedback. They are sometimes involved in initial feed-forward processing. Other <br><br>
