Iris Murdoch, <i>Existentialists and Mystics<br><br>
</i>In the grand array of occupants of the universe, from sub-atomic particles through higher <br>
animals, the animals with minds stand out as special. Some of the specialness derives from <br>
our being in this group. We interest ourselves. This interest extends to animals like us.<br>
<br>
The natural interest is grounded in more than self-interest. It is grounded in a deep <br>
joint in nature—the joint between the minded and the mindless. The joint may be ragged. <br>
It may have borderline cases. But it is real. It is relevant to matters of great value and <br>
importance—science, understanding, morality, art. Without mind, none of these pursuits <br>
or goods exist. They seem good independently of whether <i>we</i> engage with them. They <br>
depend for being good on realizing functions of certain types of minds. The minded-<br>
ness and the type of mind ground the goodness, not their being ours. My project is <br>
understanding—understanding some central aspects of mind.<br>
<br>
Understanding the mind–mindless joint requires understanding mind in its most basic <br>
forms. Of course, mind depends on the mindless and makes use of it. Without the re gu lar ities <br>
of organic chemistry, minds could not be minds. Without the regularities of the broader <br>
macro-physical world, minds could not navigate through it. In many ways, the non-minded <br>
physical world stamps itself into the very natures of mental states. In understanding mind, <br>
however, it is important to understand what is new and different about it, at its most <br>
elementary levels. Such understanding aids understanding richer forms that guide the <br>
listed pursuits. Those pursuits are not possible where mind begins. They are not pos sible for <br>
the first forms of mind. However, they depend on and employ these forms. A central aim of <br>
this book is to understand forms of mind at this initial juncture—forms of perception.<br><br>

<b>Biological Function, Action, Sensing,  <br>
<br>
and Perception—The Emergence of Mind<br><br>
</div>
</b>Before mind emerged, another deep and interesting joint in nature had already developed. <br>
Brief attention to this joint is valuable in understanding the joint on which mind hinges. <br>
Most of the universe is fire, rock, or emptiness. Already with life, there is a momentous <br>
difference. Life occupies small crevasses in the universe. However, it marks a large change <br>
from the chemical mixes from which it emerged. Although the living share a material <br>
basis with the non-living, the living comprise a genuinely new and different group of the <br>
universe’s occupants.<br>
<br>
The point is not just intuitive. It shows up in new terms and methods in the scientific <br>
study of life. Notions of function, growth, reproduction, natural selection, adaptation, </div>
