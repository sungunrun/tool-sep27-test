hence on some form of perceptual memory. (See Chapter 8, the section Is Temporal <br>
Representation Constitutive to Perceptual Representation?, and <br>
Chapter 16.)<br>
<br>
Because target-objects move or otherwise change during action and because action on <br>
those objects is imprecise—partly because of noise in the system—, future states of objects <br>
and of bodily action must be anticipated if action is to succeed. In the psychological litera-<br>
ture, anticipations are often called ‘predictions’ or ‘expectations’. I think these terms mis-<br>
leadingly intellectual. Relevant anticipation is perceptual-level. I discuss it further in <br>
Chapter 18. The correct point is that some psychological states represent future states of <br>
the world or agent.<br>
<br>
Humans and other animals often have anticipatory representations of future positions <br>
of a moving target-object. A lion anticipates the prey’s position as the prey emerges from <br>
an occlusion or as it flees. The lion runs not toward where the prey is perceived to be, but <br>
toward the anticipated position. In psychologically guided action, not only must pro prio-<br>
cep tion represent where paws currently are. It must coordinate with visual anticipation of <br>
the target-object’s later position, representing paws’ future disposition—when action is in <br>
progress, and when prey is approached.<br>
<br>
Similarly, in tracking motion, young children anticipate where an object will be in the <br>
near future, whether or not it goes behind an occlusion. Their eye movements have been <br>
shown to anticipate the future states of entities that they perceive.<br>
<br>
In addition to anticipatory representational states and perceptual states, a further cat-<br>
egory of states that help cause action, or cause conative states that cause action, is the cat-<br>
egory of affective states. Affective states here are primitive forms of emotion. In Chapter 15, <br>
I cite evidence that, given perceptual input with affective load, perceptual attention is <br>
drawn to relevant visual <i>representata</i>. These states modulate attention, which in turn affects <br>
the nature and quality of perception.677 Further evidence shows that certain types of affect, <br>
for example fear, enhance speed of processing by depressing slower, high-frequency pro-<br>
cessing in favor of faster low-frequency magnocellular-based processing. A consequence <br>
of this trade-off is that recognition of specifics is impaired, whereas generic cat egor iza tion <br>
is enhanced.678 If danger looms, fast action in response to generic type is better than slow <br>
action in response to detailed categorization.<br>
<br>
Affective states influence conative states in complex ways. The route just discussed goes <br>
through perception and perceptual attention: perception causes affect, which affects per-<br>
ceptual attention, which then affects perception and thereby conation. Other routes feed <br>
conative areas more directly by affect, caused by pre-perceptual sensing.679 I bypass detail <br>
here. Suffice it to say that perceptual-level affect is a causal factor both in perceptual pro-<br>
cessing and in conation.<br>
<br>
Affect belongs on our developing list of psychological genera that occur at perceptual-<br>
levels of representation as well as supra-perceptual levels. Non-representational affect is <br><br>
