The Cognitive Penetration Controversy 695</div>
<br><br>
3-D volume shape (or earlier-formed representations) via recurrent processing, they have <br>
been deemed “top-down”, “cognitive” penetration into what Pylyshyn took to be early vis-<br>
ual processing.1141<br>
<br>
The controversy’s framework has been handicapped by Pylyshyn’s reliance on what is <br>
now outmoded science, and by philosophers’ tendency to follow him in this reliance, years <br>
after his article and years after the science had changed. Early vision is, if it is a natural <br>
kind at all, a sub-species of more fundamental kinds—the visual perceptual system and <br>
the visuo-motor system.<br>
<br>
A second handicap that the dispute has labored under is failure, both by Pylyshyn and <br>
most opponents, to reflect seriously on what counts as cognition. Everyone agrees that <br>
belief, knowledge (understood as requiring belief), propositional inference, and intentions <br>
(understood as entering into a propositional network with belief) are cognitive. Most dis-<br>
cussants follow Pylyshyn in assuming that cognition extends well beyond these paradigm <br>
cases. Many assume that any form of endogenous attention, task-dependence, memory, <br>
learning, anticipation, imagining counts as cognition. What is nearly universal in the dis-<br>
cussion is failure to reflect seriously and fruitfully on what cognition <i>is</i> and wherein it <br>
contrasts with perception.<br>
<br>
To give a concrete example, Ned Block cites the following as ‘perhaps the most dramatic <br>
of the known top-down effects of cognition on perception’.1142 Subjects were asked to <br>
move a cursor to the position of a missing dot in a 5-by-5 array of dots. The task was made <br>
more difficult by giving the subjects 12 dots of the array, followed briefly by another 12. <br>
Fusing the two presentations would make up a 5-by-5 array with one dot missing. The <br>
second presentation was left on a screen until subjects moved the cursor. Instructions <br>
asked the subjects to create a mental image of the first array and superimpose it on the <br>
second array as it remained on the screen. Subjects found the position of the missing dot <br>
when the second 12-dot array was presented less than 50 ms after the first, but failed if the <br>
delay was 100 ms. If the delay was 1.5 to 5 seconds after the first array disappeared, sub-<br>
jects became accurate again in remembering the first array and fusing it with the second, <br>
so as to find the position of the missing dot.1143 Block comments, ‘Those [latter] results <br>
demonstrate a direct content-specific effect of cognition on perception’ (22).<br>
<br>
The sub-1-second successes appear to rely on visual sensory memory. The 1.5–5 second <br>
successes appear to involve fusing mental imagery, supported by short-term visual mem-<br>
ory, with perception. It is not clear to me wherein perception is affected. There seems to be <br>
simultaneous supplementation of a mental image, supported by perceptual memory, with <br>
a perception of a present perception of a 12-dot array. Perceptual processing itself seems <br>
unaffected.<br><br>

Pylyshyn’s conception of early vision maintains that the first 150 ms of processing are immune to causal influ-<br>
