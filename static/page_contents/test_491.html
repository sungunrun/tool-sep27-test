Perceptual Categorization is Perceptual 491</div>
<br><br>
The experiments show that one can conceptually categorize on the basis of very short <br>
exposures. They do not show that the conceptual categorizations are the only ones pro-<br>
duced, or that they are the fastest ones involved in the application of the conceptual cat-<br>
egor iza tions to the pictures. Categorizations produced by non-linguistic processing are <br>
exercises of different psychological capacities than categorizations produced by language <br>
processing. The first categorizations are known to be produced without engaging linguistic <br>
abilities. Perceptual as well as conceptual categorizations are produced in the experiments. <br>
Brevity of stimulus exposure alone does not enable one to determine how fast the concep-<br>
tual categorizations are produced.<br>
<br>
There is independent evidence that non-language-based perceptual categorizations <br>
occur 60–80 ms after stimulus onset, and that these categorizations need not depend on <br>
higher-level conceptual primes or higher-level input into the dominantly feed-forward <br>
processing. (See Chapter 11.) This evidence does not derive from experiments that center <br>
on brevity of stimulus exposure. There is the time that is required to get from those initial <br>
non-linguistic categorizations (and other, richer categorizations that are obtained by <br>
150–180 ms) to the subjects’ responses. During that time further processing inevitably <br>
occurs.652 Some of it is linguistic or otherwise conceptual. Whereas there is strong evi-<br>
dence that initial categorizations do not depend on language, eventual categorizations are <br>
expressed in language. The systems that process visual and auditory perception of words <br>
differ from those that process non-linguistic sounds and shapes.653 The route from the <br>
linguistic perceptual systems to verbalized conceptual categorization is different from the <br>
route from non-linguistic perception to conceptual categorization (linguistically expressed <br>
or not). The categorizations expressed in language occur in a network of capacities to form <br>
sentences and engage in propositional inference. So they are different psychological cap-<br>
aci ties from those involved in initial categorizations. They are different categorization <br>
capacities, hence different attributives. So there is a change in attributives from initial per-<br>
ceptual categorization to eventual, clearly conceptual, categorizations. I think it likely that <br>
the latter categorizations are formed very fast, but not as fast as the non-linguistic, percep-<br>
tual categorizations. (See note 654 below.)<br>
<br>
A second oversight is a corollary of the first. Linguistic meanings are expressed by sub-<br>
jects in characterizing what they saw after very brief stimulus exposures. Linguistic mean-<br>
ings are conceptual in functioning to contribute to a propositional structure and to <br>
propositional reasoning. Representations that occur in visual perceptual categorizations, <br>
<i>even those that have the same indicants that counterpart meanings in language do</i>, are <br>
themselves perceptual. There are perceptual representations of <i>body</i>, <i>cubical body</i>, and <br><br>

<b>FN</b>652 Of course, after one picture is presented for 13 ms, other pictures follow, with the same lightning-fast <br>
stimu lus exposure. Potter postulates that, with qualifications for masking effects (discussed in Chapter 10, the <br>
section Two Lines of Empirical Criticism of Treisman’s Theory), several different stimuli, each <br>
briefly exposed, can be processed to completion, one after another. She calls this idea the “car-wash” model. <br>

Perception, and Psychophysics</i> 76 (2014), 270–279. Potter is aware that processing goes on well after the initial <br>
categorizations occur (see 276). Ned Block has made a similar point in work that is, as far as I know, unpublished. <br>
Potter is not ideally clear in discussing relations between language-independent categorizations and linguistically <br>
expressed categorizations. See Chapter 16, the section Conceptual Short-Term Memory, for criticism.<br>
