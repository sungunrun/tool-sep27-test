310 The Iconic Nature of Perception</div>

Chapter 3, the section Retinal Image Contour Registration and Surface <br>
Contour Perception, that an edge in the registration of the retinal image is marked <br>
by a line of neurons that fire at a much higher intensity than a line of adjacent neurons. <br>
Among central cues to representation of spatial attributes of environmental edges, <br>
 shadows, and textural features of surfaces—attributes such as slant and tilt<i>—</i>are patterns <br>
among lengths and orientations of edges in registrations of the 2-D retinal image.<br>
<br>
For example, a pattern of lines in the initial registration of the retinal image that <br>
grows progressively smaller at the top of a pattern, in comparison to the bottom, might <br>
be a cue to foreshortening that would indicate a backward slant of a surface. Or a pat-<br>
tern of lines that grows progressively shorter in a pattern from left to right might be a <br>
cue to surface tilt.<br>
<br>
The patterns are present in a perceptual representation. At <i>perceptual</i>  stages of process-<br>
ing they are given content that represents features of entities in 3-D physical space. For <br>
example, the lines might represent textural features on a surface with an orientation. Or <br>
they may represent the contours of the facing part of a body. Other cues are relevant—<br>
shadows, consistency with occurring within surface boundaries, binocular disparity. <br>
Patterns of geometrical characteristics in registrations that come from pre-representational <br>
stages of vision (and that can be directly correlated with spatial patterns among neuronal <br>
firings) are a <i>central</i> cue to computations of perceptual representational content that <br>
attributes 3-D volume shapes in the environment.<br>
<br>
Roughly, a pattern of lines in a plane takes on 3-D meaning, in something like the way <br>
in which the lines in a drawing are used to represent shapes in 3-D space. Again, science <br>
takes the percept—hence its representational content—to have a geometrical structure <br>
that has systematic, natural, iconic, mappings to structures in physical space.<br>
<br>
The science’s theory and practice take the structure and these aspects of the content of <br>
visual representation to be systematically analogous to structure and content in drawings <br>
or other pictures.325 Again, the representation’s being iconic does not hinge on its being in <br>
space. It is enough that it have a geometrical or topological structure that has a natural <br>
mapping to spatial structures. The idea that visual spatial representation occurs in a <br>
 map-like format that bears systematic relations to underlying neural visual field maps is <br>
well supported. This is the format of spatial and temporal frameworks described in <br>
Chapter 7, the section Minimalism and Iconic Representation in a Spatial <br>
Coordinate System and in Chapter 8, the section Egocentric Spatial Indexes <br>
in Perception. Work in the psychophysics of vision repeatedly relies on the idea.<br>
<br>
So the iconic nature of visual spatial representational content is grounded in the layout <br>
of visual receptors and in the layout of the environment. It is also grounded in the iconic <br>
nature of visual information registration in the central brain that corresponds to space-<br>
mapping areas in visual perception. All five factors—visual spatial representation, visual <br>
information registration in brain areas that underlie spatial perception, information <br><br>
