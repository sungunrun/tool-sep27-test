338 The Iconic Nature of Perception</div>
<br><br>
For illustration, I take a uniform size and shape of smallest discernible units. I assume <br>
smallest perceptually discernible pixel-like units to be rectangles.<br>
<br>
In perceiving <i>S</i> as a surface, one perceives every unobstructed, perceptually discernible <br>
sub-part of <i>S</i> <i>as</i> a surface and as a part of <i>S</i>. I assume that there are contiguity restrictions <br>
on what sub-parts are perceived <i>as</i> parts of a larger perceived natural unit. Frequently, one <br>
perceives parts of other sub-parts <i>as</i> parts of those sub-parts—not just as parts of <i>S</i>. I lay <br>
this point aside for now. One also sees <i>S</i> and the relevant sub-parts as having other at tri-<br>
butes—color, lightness, spatial relations to other sub-parts, direction, either distance or <br>
ordinal depth from the viewer, and so on. Such further attributions apply to sub-parts <br>
localized within the mapped natural unit (here, <i>S</i>). I ignore attributives for most of these <br>
attributes, except for the spatial positioning ones.<br>
<br>
<i>S</i> is itself located in the map-like spatial framework applied in a perceptual state. Usually, <br>
the framework would be applied to many other things besides <i>S</i>, mapping spatial relations <br>
between <i>S</i> and other things. All perceived entities would be mapped relative to viewer <br>
anchor position<i>.</i> <i>S</i> and each perceived sub-part of <i>S</i> are perceptually referred to by a differ-<br>
ent referential application. There is a veritable rain of referential applications arranged in a <br>
matrix-like array.<br>
<br>
Suppose that <i>S</i> is perceived. Suppose that each smallest pixel-like, smallest perceptually <br>
discernible part of <i>S</i> is perceived. Suppose that sub-parts of <i>S</i> that are larger than these <br>
smallest perceptually discernible parts are made up of smallest parts as aggregate mem-<br>
bers or cells. Suppose that there are 2-, 3-, 4-, and 5-cell sub-parts of <i>S</i>. Suppose that each <br>
cell of these cell sub-parts of <i>S</i> shares either a side or a corner with some other cell in the <br>
perceived sub-part of <i>S</i>. So the left-most-column cell in the top row and the right-most-<br>
column cell in the bottom row do not form a perceived 2-cell sub-part. The left-most col-<br>
umn cell in the top row and the middle column cell in the top row do (they share a side). <br>
The top-row cell in the left-most column and the second-row cell in the middle column <br>
also form a 2-cell sub-part (they share a corner point). On these illustrative suppositions, <br>
<i>S</i> and 53 of its sub-parts are perceived. In a perception of <i>S</i>, there are 54 referential appli-<br>
cations, not counting referential applications to features. See Figure 9.2.<br>
<br>
The details of the contiguity conditions are empirically complex. Invocation of corner-<br>
point contiguity is entirely for illustration. Contiguity constraints may well allow for per-<br>
ceiving both wholes and sub-parts when there are smallest perceptually discernible parts. <br>
For example, in perceiving a line with a very small gap in it, the perceptual system may <br>
either ignore the small gap and count perceived cells on either side of the gap as parts of <br>
the same line, or fill in the gap with an illusory representation of a part.368 None of these <br>
details matter here. What matters is the large number of referential applications, each <br>
effecting a seeing of a different part of a natural-unit whole. A surface consisting of 6 <br>
smallest perceptually discerned parts causes 54 referential applications. The number of <br>
referential applications for larger surfaces grows remains finite, but grows roughly expo-<br>
nentially with increase in the number of smallest perceivable cells.<br>
<br>
Each referential application to a sub-part of <i>S</i> is guided by the attributive surface. It <br>
helps apply the attributive part of, which relates the seen sub-part (themselves counting as <br><br>
