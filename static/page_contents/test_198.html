cancelling the anticipation. Such mode shifts are comparable to changes, at the prop os-<br>
ition al level, from predictive affirmation to suspension of belief or denial.<br>
<br>
The mistake to avoid here is conflating such a shift in mode with a shift from a frustrated <br>
anticipation to a commitment to a negation of representational content of the ori gin al <br>
anticipation. We say colloquially that the lion comes to see <i>that</i> there is no impala there. <br>
There is no explanatory value in postulating a negation in perceptual content, given that a <br>
non-committal or rejectional <i>mode</i> suffices. Psychology already needs modes—posi tive <br>
anticipation, the positively committal mode of perception itself, response to frustration of <br>
anticipation, uncertainty, non-responsiveness, indifference. To justify postulating negation <br>
in the representational content, one must show some advantage to postulating committal <br>
mode with a negated content, over postulating negative committal mode with an unne-<br>
gated content—frustrated anticipation, or avoidance of responding to a perceptual repre-<br>
sentation. One needs an argument to show that a perceiver forms a posi tive commitment to <br>
the negation of a perceptual representational content.<br>
<br>
If an impala does not find an anticipated predator, its state shifts to non-anticipation. It <br>
relaxes. A similar point applies to a lion’s frustrated anticipation of an impala’s appearance. <br>
The lion loses the anticipation and foregoes tensed crouching. In a correct, colloquial way <br>
of speaking, the animal sees that there is no impala and finds absence of prey. It perceives <br>
a situation that lacks an anticipated prey. The lion’s state still lacks negation in its represen-<br>
tational content.<br>
<br>
I believe that postulating a negation operator in perceptual anticipation and percep-<br>
tual memory has no explanatory value. Negation, even predicate negation, is an element <br>
in propositional representational contents. It emerges at higher levels of representation <br>
than do rejection-like modalities. Here, modalities ground explanation of perceptual <br>
competence.<br>
<br>
Talk of perception of absence is metaphorical. Usually what is described is a disap-<br>
pointed perceptual anticipation of presence, and a consequent relinquishment of a com-<br>
mitment to presence. Taking absences to be perceptual <i>representata</i> seems to me a clear <br>
category mistake. One cannot perceive what cannot cause the perception. Absences are <br>
nothings. Nothings cannot cause.<br>
<br>
What of disjunction? Does a connective for disjunction occur in the representational <br>
contents of perceptual memory or anticipation? The representational function and the <br>
iconic character of perception exclude disjunctions from perception. Perceptual memory <br>
retains past perceptions. As we have seen, perceptual memory can be indefinite, losing <br>
retention of perceptual applications to particulars. Such memory is, however, not dis junct-<br>
ive. It is schematic. Similar points apply to indefiniteness in perceptual anticipation.<br>
<br>
One might conceive an analog of disjunction in the following case. An animal has per-<br>
ceptual memories both of a pond and a field. Both areas are food sources. The animal <br>
needs to forage. It anticipates foraging in both areas. For a short period it is uncertain <br>
which area to forage in first. Perhaps some stimulus such as perception of rain triggers a <br>
mechanism that favors one area, the field, because it is associated with memory of richer <br>
density of food after a rain. The animal moves toward the field, and allots its initial for-<br>
aging time there, postponing time at the pond. When the animal is uncertain as to which <br>
of the areas it goes to first, one might think that the animal has a perceptual anticipation of <br>
approaching either the field or the pond. Then the animal might be thought to have a dis-<br>
junct ive perceptual anticipation.</div>
