processing. Initial feedback stabilizes or reinforces the go-no-go (animal-body-or-not) <br>
response that Thorpe discovered. Numerous studies indicate that this first ultra-rapid <br>
response is cued by relatively gross, low-frequency spatial information, although antecedent <br>
attention and pre-cueing can tune early-responding sensors to higher-frequencies.529 So <br>
an initial sketch is enriched at this feedback phase of processing.<br>
<br>
Neural activity that correlates at better than chance with reptiles and faces begins at <br>
70–80 ms. Human visual systems can initiate a saccade to a face by 90–110 ms. Detection <br>
of food, as well as other animals, is just slightly slower.<br>
<br>
There seem to be three phases of <i>face-categorization</i> processing. These phases cor res-<br>
pond roughly to phases of other types of categorization that are, at least initially, slightly <br>
less fast.<br>
<br>
The first begins at 70–80 ms and runs to 140–150 ms gaining accuracy during the inter-<br>
val.530 Fastest responses are to well-isolated faces. Very fast speeds are achieved even in <br>
extremely low-contrast luminance conditions. Such speeds do not depend on attention.531<br>
<br>
During this phase, categorizations consolidate and refine through refinement of other <br>
invariances, principally size and position constancies. This process is supported by <br>
events in the ventral pathway. The process is dominantly feed-forward. First categoriza-<br>
tions at 70–80 ms of animal-bodies and faces, may be based on 2-D outlines of objects, <br>
or object parts. The fact that these outlines are dispositionally associated with constancies <br>
for size and position helps support taking the responses at 70–80 ms as <i>perceptual</i> <br>
categorizations.532<br>
<br>
A second phase, which involves greater, partly attentional, feedback from frontal and <br>
parietal areas to occipital areas and the temporal fusiform face area, which are especially <br>
responsive to faces, occurs at 140–200 ms. Endogenous attention in this phase tends to be <br>
task-oriented. More reliable and higher-frequency representations of category-types are <br>
formed. The higher-frequency information enables differentiating particular faces and <br>
providing bases for identification of the same face again. It also makes categorization more <br>
reliable with distractor interference.533 Similarly, with various other sorts of bodies, cat-<br>
egor ized by specific shape.<br>
<br>
The fusiform face area (FFA) responds, in the first phase, to shapes that cue faces. In the <br>
second phase, detail is filled in. Categorization, even for a kind like <i>face</i> that has a dedi-<br>
cated brain area, is supported in several brain areas—including inferior occipital, superior <br><br>
