Attribution of Further Structural Elements of Agency 477</div>

and beneficiaries, which are more specific roles of target objects. Anticipation must be <br>
schooled through memory of past observations of similar acts.<br>
<br>
A further common class of targets, for higher animals, is tool making and tool use. This <br>
class is interesting not only because it enriches types of target object that primitive agency <br>
attribution can attribute. It also introduces an instrumental relation (with) in the primitive <br>
agency-representation structures. With attributives in pre-linguistic agency attribution <br>
slot into thematic or theta structure in early language use.<br>
<br>
There are well-documented cases of prolonged teaching and learning through observa-<br>
tion in the use of tools by non-human animals. Chimpanzees regularly make and use tools <br>
in the wild. A common use of tools is to crack nuts using rocks as hammers and rocks or <br>
roots as anvils. Different types of nuts require different sizes of rocks. Chimpanzees trans-<br>
port rocks to where the nuts are. They tend to transport rocks that are of the right size and <br>
are as close as possible to the location of the nuts. Mothers share nuts that they crack with <br>
offspring. Learning nut-cracking technique and food-sharing occur simultaneously. <br>
Young chimpanzees take 2–3 years to learn the technique of cracking soft nuts and 3–4 <br>
years to learn to crack harder nuts. Maximum efficiency in cracking harder nuts can take <br>
eight years. Learning use of the tools requires learning that a rock must be used to crack <br>
the nuts, learning to place a nut on an appropriate anvil at an appropriate angle, and so on. <br>
Parents have been observed to demonstrate correct positioning of the nut on a rock for <br>
offspring who were positioning it incorrectly. They have also been observed to demon-<br>
strate correct grip on the relevant part of a rock. Pedagogical interventions are frequent.642<br>
<br>
Observation of tool use by young primates involves learning a relational structure in the <br>
parent’s agency. The cracking is represented as by the agent, as having the target of getting <br>
the nut cracked and available for eating, as directed toward a target object or theme (the <br>
nut), and as being with an instrument (the rock). The cracking is represented as on the anvil.<br>
<br>
The fact that both human children and non-human primates need to learn tool use sug-<br>
gests that it takes time to learn to represent the structure of the relation between act, <br>
object, and instrument. The nature of the learning has, I think, not been fully explored. <br>
Whether some of the learning is perceptual and affects attributives in the visual system is <br>
not clear.<br>
<br>
I conjecture that at least some of the relational structure is embedded by learning in <br>
visual systems of human infants and some higher animals. There are, of course, species <br>
differences. Primates that use tools less than chimpanzees are less likely to have coded the <br>
instrument relation.<br>
<br>
I am interested in these structural factors in primitive representation of agency partly <br>
because they are central to understanding the central focus of early <i>propositional</i> represen-<br>
tation. Especially social animals show an extraordinary interest in agency. Sentences about <br>
agency are dominant in early language use. The main structural categories that we have <br>
been exploring show up early in the grammatical, thematic structure of nearly all <br>
languages.<br>
<br>
Agents are designated by grammatical subjects; acts, by verbs; objects or themes of acts, <br>
by grammatical direct objects; locations and paths, by locatives; beneficiaries, by indirect <br><br>
