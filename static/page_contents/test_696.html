696 Perception and Cognition</div>

It is also unclear to me wherein cognition is involved. Block does not say what cogni-<br>
tion is supposed to do the penetrating. Is it the mental imagery? Is it short-term memory? <br>
Long-term memory? Block elsewhere takes propositional attitudes to be paradigms. No <br>
explanation is given of a relation between superimposition of mental imagery and prop os-<br>
ition al attitudes.<br>
<br>
The task is performed by forming a perceptual image from a perceptual memory and <br>
fusing it with a current perception. The image just uses a remembered perceptual content. <br>
The superposition yields a hybrid of the remembered perceptual content and a present <br>
perceptual content. The mental activity amounts to connecting a perceptual representa-<br>
tion with another representation that contains perceptual attributives in a perceptual for-<br>
mat. This imagery use of perceptual content is <i>less</i> complex and advanced than rotation, <br>
which in section Chapter 18, the section Perceptual Imagining, I argued to be <br>
essentially similar to perceptual processes postulated by mainstream vision scientists as <br>
being involved in perceptual constancies for shape. The contents of both the image and the <br>
memory are perceptual. Endogenous control over a process of fusion does not make the <br>
process cognitive. Otherwise direction of attention or control over one’s eye movements <br>
would count automatically as cognitive, which it does not. The removal of 5 seconds from <br>
the here and now of perception does not make a process cognitive. None of these capaci-<br>
ties is shown to be like propositional attitudes, the paradigms of cognition.<br>
<br>
It appears that the subjects use of perceptual-level capacities (perceptual imagining and <br>
perceptual memory) combined with perception. Pylyshyn would have said that the former <br>
capacities are cognitive, and has influenced others to say the same. Saying does not make it so.<br>
<br>
One might suggest that understanding and intending to comply with the instructions <br>
are supposed to be the penetrators. Then the appeal to drama is unmotivated. It is unclear <br>
how the case is more dramatic than subjects’ carrying out purely visual tasks in response <br>
to instructions. Instructions affect later visual processing and sustain subjects’ efforts. This <br>
type of “penetration” has been known since the advent of the science. It is not a dramatic <br>
demonstration of anything.<br>
<br>
A striking aspect of Block’s discussion is the assumption that it is obvious what the <br>
“cognition” is that penetrates. Nearly all philosophers have failed to reflect seriously on <br>
what cognition is. Philosophers are not the only ones to have failed. When vision scientists <br>
in perceptual psychology (as distinct from social psychology) use the term ‘cognition’, they <br>
too fail to explicate it. This tendency is combined with loose use of language in describing <br>
capacities that they count as cognition. Any sort of anticipation is often called ‘expecta-<br>
tion’ or ‘prediction’. Any memory is often called ‘knowledge’. Any task-dependence is <br>
counted dependence on intention.<br>
<br>
Often, the memories are perceptually learned, stored associations between past percep-<br>
tual representations. It is puzzling that in psychology a term like ‘knowledge’ is used for <br>
such stored associations. For in other contexts—in discussions of learning, for example—<br>
psychologists consistently contrast ordinary association with knowledge, and with any-<br>
thing cognitive in a sense that would designate a supra-perceptual level of representation. <br>
In most vision-science articles, careless uses of terms like ‘knowledge’ can be re-construed <br>
so as not to affect empirical results. Still, such usage should not be prevalent in a science. It <br>
is wind for the spread of fog.<br>
<br>
When an aggressive advocate of cognitive penetration engages in such uses, confusion <br>
ensues. The psychologist Gary Lupyan repeatedly cites states of what he calls ‘knowledge’ </div>
