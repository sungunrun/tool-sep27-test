A spatial representational framework does not <i>apply</i> spatial attributives to every pos-<br>
ition that it maps. Every discriminable position in space between the perceiver and a per-<br>
ceived particular represented as being in a certain position is mapped. The spatial <br>
framework maps such positions in the sense that the position’s presence is a mathematical <br>
consequence of the actual spatial attributions that are made via the framework. However, <br>
many of those positions are not represented by an applied perceptual attributive.<br>
<br>
Take the position 72.3% of the way between the anchor position for the spatial frame-<br>
work and an object that is seen as being at a specific distance. The perceptual system <br>
attributes a location to the object, by computing a unit-free distance and direction between <br>
the anchor of the framework and the object. The 72.3% distant position is included in the <br>
space that the perceptual state locates perceived particulars within. But no applied attribu-<br>
tive relates that position (even in a unit-free way) to either the anchor or the object. <br>
Nothing is perceived as being <i>in</i> that position. The position itself is not perceived. All <br>
applied visual relational spatial attributives relate purportedly perceived entities either to <br>
one another or to viewer position. All non-relational spatial attributives are attributed <br>
only to particulars or anchor positions. So no spatial attributive is applied to that position. <br>
The visual system does not mark that position—or indefinitely many other positions <br>
between the eyes and the object. Of course, the visual system <i>could</i> mark the position, if <br>
the system were to function to pick out an entity that occupies it.<br>
<br>
Even though many positions in the space that includes visibly perceived entities are not <br>
specifically represented, there remain a huge number of relational spatial attributives that <br>
are applied in any normal visual representational content. Again, the systematic iconic <br>
representation of spatial attributes and the iconic mapping of space by the visual system <br>
induces huge numbers of applied representational contents. The visual system is a very <br>
complex system of competencies.<br>
<br>
So far I have focused on visual iconic representation of <i>surfaces</i>. Visual perceptual sys-<br>
tems also employ attributives for edges, textural aspects of surfaces, shadows, color or <br>
lightness patterns on surfaces, motion, 3-D shapes, and bodies.<br>
<br>
Edges are usually not perceived as edges unless they are perceived as edges <i>of</i> particu-<br>
lars, such as surfaces, textures, or parts of a rainbow, or bodies. <i>Perceptual</i> attributives for <br>
edges are normally formed as boundary-making adjuncts to attributives for larger units.<br>
<br>
An edge attributive is normally accompanied by a relational attributive, something like <br>
x edge of y, where ‘x’ stands in for a perceptual representation as of an edge and ‘y’ stands <br>
in for perceptual representation as of a particular that the edge is <i>of</i>. (See Chapter 4, the <br>
section Representational-Dependence Hierarchies in Perceptual <br>
Attribution.) The relation is represented iconically. The representation of the edge <br>
boundary bears a systematic structural relation to the representation of the bounded <br>
entity. In iconic format the relation is represented via a relational structure that holds <br>
together non-relational attributions. The relational structure is the format of a relational <br>
attributive. The attributive is a competence for perceptually relating the edge to the sur-<br>
face, using it in representing a surface boundary. The competence differs from the compe-<br>
tence to perceptually pick out the edge as an edge with its own attributes.<br>
<br>
Think of how a surface’s edge is drawn. There are discrete representational elements for <br>
the edge, or boundary, and its parts. There is a discrete representational element for the <br>
bounded surface. There is, however, no mark for the relation itself. The relation is repre-<br>
sented by a relation among the representational elements.Iconic Format and Representational Content 357</div>
