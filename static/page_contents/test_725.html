What Should Count as Cognition? 725</div>

causes of perceived actions, children almost surely employ cognitive representational <br>
competencies.<br>
<br>
One can probably attribute the causal relation between actions and their causes, targets, <br>
target-objects, agents, and so on, at the perceptual level. (See the formalizations in <br>
Chapter 12, the section Attribution of Further Structural Elements of <br>
Agency.) However, once an individual attributes an internal cause of the action—<br>
whether or not the internal cause is a representational state—, the individual is likely to <br>
make an attribution to a particular that <i>cannot</i> be perceived. I think that we cannot per-<br>
ceive others’ conative sensory states, whether or not they are representational.1179<br>
<br>
It follows that conceptual causal attributives often differ from perceptual-level causal <br>
attributives in applying to at least one <i>relatum</i> whose representation involves an attributive <br>
that does not always function to guide picking out the <i>relatum perceptually</i>. However one <br>
represents an internal cause in another individual, it is not via a perception, perceptual <br>
memory, or perceptual anticipation of it. Representing such a cause must use an attribu-<br>
tive that does not function to guide picking it out. Both a relational causal attributive and <br>
a one-place attributive that functions in representing the internal cause are plausibly <br>
supra-perceptual and cognitive. Notice again that it is plausible that the one-place attribu-<br>
tive for the other’s internal state is not just cognitive; it is plausibly conceptual. It certainly <br>
has a function that goes beyond guiding a perceptual referential application to a particular. <br>
Plausibly, it also has a main-verb-phrase-like function, making it a concept. Whether there <br>
is a capacity here that threads the needle—being supra-perceptual in having a function <br>
that does not guide perceptual reference to a particular, but being non-conceptual in lack-<br>
ing a main-verb-phrase-like function, is doubtful, but can be left open.<br>
<br>
There are other attributives that are plausibly cognitive not because they apply to par-<br>
ticulars that cannot be perceived, but because using them requires supra-perceptual <br>
capacities. I have several times cited certain natural kind attributives as examples. Using <br>
them requires a capacity to distinguish between how a particular appears (or is presented <br>
in perception) and what the particular <i>is</i>. Such a capacity is not present in any perceptual <br>
competence—including competencies to retain or project perception. It is plausibly essen-<br>
tially a conceptual capacity.<br>
<br>
A similar point applies to certain functional attributives. Although perceptual-level <br>
competencies probably include some attributives that indicate functions, they do not <br>
include all. An individual could not have the attributive competence academic economist <br>
and have only perceptual-level capacities. This case seems similar to the <br><br>

<b>FOOTNOTES</b><br>
<b>FN</b>1179 One can sometimes <i>sense</i> one’s own sensory states. This point could perhaps be extended to conative <br>
states. And there are proprioceptive perceptions of one’s own internal bodily states. Some claim that all attribu-<br>
tions of internal psychological states to others derive from “like-me” simulations to oneself. Then the attributed <br>
cause-type could be regarded as having instances that are either sensible or perceivable. On such a view this <br>
source of thinking that causal attributions of internal states to others must be supra-perceptual would be under-<br>
mined. It is an open question whether simulation is the fundamental way of representing others’ psychological <br>
states, even low-level ones. My point here is just that these issues are complex. I just sketch ways of mapping <br>
territory.<br>
<br>
In Burge, ‘Do Infants and Non-Human Animals Attribute Mental States?’, I do not strictly distinguish between <br>
cases in which internal sensory and conative states are attributed by infants and non-human animals, on one <br>
hand, and cases in which no internal states are attributed, and only sensory relations and actions are attributed, <br>
on the other. The distinction was not central to the main issues discussed there. I should have flagged the distinc-<br>
tion, however. Going internal in representations of others is probably an important step in representational level. <br>
This issue, again, is connected to the simulation issue.</div>
