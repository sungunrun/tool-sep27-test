regis ter direction.376 <i>In themselves</i>, natural mappings inherent in the 2-D matrix represent <br>
nothing. Given that a matrix-like 2-D format is used in representation, it affects mode of <br>
presentation of perceptual content. Its <i>being</i> representational and <i>what</i> it represents are <br>
determined by competence, including perceptual constancy, and use. As I have repeatedly <br>
emphasized, iconic structure enables the enormous number of representations present in <br>
even simple visual perceptual systems.<br><br>

<b>The Tractability of Iconic Attributional Complexity<br><br>
</div>
</b>The immense representational complexity of perception contrasts sharply with most lin-<br>
guistic representation and much conceptual/propositional representation. The Chinese <br>
proverb, ‘A picture is worth ten thousand words’ vastly understates perceptual richness. <br>
The proverb alludes to a picture’s “worth” in carrying complex information in compact, <br>
tractable form.<br>
<br>
Visual perception represents as pictures represent or, given representation of motion, as <br>
movies represent, except that the perceptual representation is not viewed, involves no <br>
maker, and requires no interpreter. The representation is natural and automatic. Its con-<br>
tent consists in representational competencies. The competencies do not strictly include <br>
interpretation.<br>
<br>
Much language is not iconic or picture-like. A sentence, ‘A brown, cubical body rests on <br>
a red body’, or a thought with similar content, carries relatively little information. The sen-<br>
tence represents very few aspects of the situation. The sentence and the corresponding <br>
thought do not say what shade of brown the cubical body has, what shade of red the other <br>
body has, whether the shade is uniform or just dominant, what the bodies’ sizes are, what <br>
the red body’s shape is, where on the red body the cubical body rests, whether either body <br>
is shadowed, what textures the surfaces of the bodies have, whether there are other bodies <br>
nearby, and so on. A visual perception of an actual scene described by the sentence usually <br>
functions to settle all or most of these matters.<br>
<br>
Several factors underlie this point. All are associated with perception’s iconic format.<br>
<br>
First, unlike most linguistic representation and much representation in propositional <br>
thought, visual perception nearly always represents at different levels of abstraction at the <br>
same time. It represents a specific color shade. It also typically groups that shade with <br>
other shades as instantiating a “color”—some broader range of shades. Similarly percep-<br>
tion attributes shapes and sizes at various levels of abstractions—<i>connected outer bound-<br>
ary</i>, <i>tubular</i>, <i>tubular</i> with a specific ratio of length and diameter, and so on. Bodies might <br>
be grouped into large, intermediate, and small sizes, perhaps because of their functional <br>
roles in the life of the particular organism.<br>
<br>
Second, unlike most linguistic and much conceptual/propositional representation, per-<br>
ception normally represents packages of different types of attributes. The sentence ‘A body <br>
rests on another body’ provides information only about instances of the attribute <i>body</i> and <br>
a spatial relation between them. A perception—like a picture—normally does not <br><br>
