210 Attributives, Referential Applications in Constancies</div>

inferentially to other psychological states differently from the way thought a = a, is con-<br>
nected to them, the thoughts have different representational components, and are different <br>
thoughts.<br>
<br>
I believe that perceptual constancies embody, at a more primitive level of representa-<br>
tion, analogs of the point that Frege made. Different perceptual states (with their represen-<br>
tational contents) that are part of a constancy capacity exhibit analogs of different Fregean <br>
cognitive values expressed in identity statements by the singular terms that refer to a com-<br>
mon <i>representatum</i>. Relations between different perceptual states in a perceptual con-<br>
stancy capacity exhibit analogs of the more informative, true identity statements (for <br>
example (a-b)). Reflecting on perceptual constancies is a tool for improving understand-<br>
ing of perceptual representational contents.<br>
<br>
Before developing this point, I sketch the main idea in a common-sense, intuitive way. <br>
I describe a perceptual constancy in a way that brings out the core of the point. The <br>
description is meant just to provide an intuitive introduction to the more precise account <br>
that I develop. I do not present the description, in the next paragraph, as an argument for <br>
my understanding of perceptual constancies. I present it first only to provide an initial grip <br>
on that understanding.<br>
<br>
Suppose that a rectangular surface with visible edges is perpendicular to the line of <br>
sight. An individual accurately perceives the top edge of the surface as an edge and <br>
ac cur ate ly perceives the edge’s length as <i>l</i>. Suppose that later the individual accurately <br>
perceives an edge (perhaps the same edge) as a top edge, and as having length <i>l</i>, where <br>
the surface with the edge is slanted backwards from the line of sight. Intuitively, one <br>
might elaborate the case this way: The individual perceives an instance of <i>edge</i> as an <br>
edge, and as having length <i>l</i>, in both conditions. The edge or edges and the length pre-<br>
sent different looks under the different conditions. Via the different looks, the edge con-<br>
tinues to look like an edge. The length continues to look length <i>l</i>. The <i>ways</i> an edge looks <br>
like an edge and the <i>way</i>s length <i>l</i> looks to be length <i>l</i> differ in the two cases. (See <br>
Figure 7.1 for illustration.)<br>
<br>
The perceiver is in different kinds of perceptual states in the two conditions. Visual <i>rep-<br>
resentata</i> do not differ. So representational contents in the two conditions differ, even <br>
though the same focal attributes—<i>edge</i> and <i>length l</i>—are represented in both cases. Same <br>
<i>representata</i>; different representational contents, and representations.<br>
<br>
More generally (to include unconscious visual states), the ways of perceiving differ. <br>
Ways of perceiving particulars as edges and as being, or having, length <i>l</i> are repeatable, <br>
<i>ability-general</i> aspects of perceptual states. The differences in the kinds reside in different, <br>
ability-general types of representational content. The different ways of perceiving are dif-<br>
ferent repeatable competencies.<br>
<br>
The only relevant kind of ability-general, perceptual representational content that <br>
 constitutes a way of perceiving an entity as having an attribute is a perceptual attributive. <br>
A perceptual attributive functions to characterize a perceived particular as instantiating a <br>
specific property, relation, or kind. Perceptual attributives function to <i>indicate</i> an at tri-<br>
bute, and to <i>attribute</i> that attribute to a particular (or particulars) when perceptual states <br>
occur. Different attributives attribute the same “constant” attribute in different exercises of <br>
a perceptual constancy. Different attributives are different ways of perceptually represent-<br>
ing—different perspectives on—the same attribute. The different attributives indicate and <br>
attribute the same attribute.</div>
