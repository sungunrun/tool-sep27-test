Thereafter there is a strong feedback of these kinds.1164 The initial feed-forward aspect of <br>
visual processing may be a psychological natural kind—a subsystem of the visual system.<br>
<br>
Standing behind our discussion of cognitive penetration is what I take to be the most <br>
fundamental divide among psychological natural kinds—the divide between non-<br>
propositional and propositional representational states. Even if it turned out that there <br>
was no deep divide between what could be explained computationally and what could not <br>
be, this divide would remain.<br>
<br>
Since representational form follows representational function, the form-based prop os-<br>
ition al/non-propositional divide is induced by a functional difference. What makes a <br>
propositional-level system a different system is at least partly that its states have basic rep-<br>
resentational functions that differ from those of the perceptual-level system. Unlike per-<br>
ceptual attributives, conceptual attributives function constitutively to contribute to <br>
propositional structures.<br>
<br>
Representational function follows representational competence. Unlike perceptual <br>
attributives, conceptual attributives can engage in main-verb-phrase-like attribution that <br>
does not function to guide picking out particulars. A competence for that sort of attribu-<br>
tion is connected with a competence for propositional inference.<br>
<br>
Propositional inference includes operations like generalization, negation, disjunction, <br>
and conditionalization whose applications are <i>not</i> constitutively associated with picking <br>
out particulars.1165 Use of propositional capacities also occurs in broadly inductive reason-<br>
ing and in certain analogical or structural-alignment types of thinking. (See next section.) <br>
These representational differences are so fundamental and systematic that they constitute <br>
the most basic distinction between these two broad kinds. These matters are not the pri-<br>
mary focus of this work. They have loomed prominently in the background.<br>
<br>
I have left open whether there is “thinking” that is supra-perceptual but not prop os-<br>
ition al. As we have seen, a lot of “problem solving” occurs at the perceptual-level. But <br>
there is probably territory occupied by supra-perceptual, non-propositional kinds. One <br>
should be as pluralistic about psychological systems as empirical evidence allows. There <br>
are many sub-systems in each system. Among propositional capacities, there are sub-<br>
systems for judging probability, forming self-characterizations, forming associations from <br>
memory with perceptual beliefs, decision making under uncertainty, solving logical prob-<br>
lems, noticing analogies, reflection, and so on.<br>
<br>
Finding large systems by tracing connections among more specific sub-systems is the <br>
surer method than the other way around. The glossy dual-systems talk discussed at the <br>
beginning of this section is, I think, a cautionary tale.1166 Perceptual psychology has <br><br>

Role of Early Vision, and the Cognitive Impenetrability of Early Vision’ and Raftopoulos, <i>Cognitive Penetrability <br>
and the Epistemic Role of Perception</i>. Although strongly feed-forward, I doubt that it is causally encapsulated from <br>
cognitive information, as Raftopoulos claims. See Chapter 15, the section Perceptual-Level Attention <br>
Commands and Guidance of Saccades, especially notes 791–792. Some cognitive information is prob-<br>
ably fed <i>forward</i> via endogenous attention.<br>
