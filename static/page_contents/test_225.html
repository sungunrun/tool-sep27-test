veridically representing this straight, left edge of a surface, perceived as in the frontal-<br>
parallel plane, the system plots the locations that the edge occupies from its top to its bot-<br>
tom. Suppose that in the straight-on view, the mid-point of the edge is 4 meters from the <br>
anchor position, and each of its endpoints is 5 meters from the anchor position. Then the <br>
edge is 6 meters long. (A right triangle is made by (a) the 4-meter line of sight from anchor <br>
point to the mid-point of the vertically oriented edge, (b) the line from the mid-point of <br>
the edge to the edge’s top, and (c) the 5 meter line of sight from the anchor point to the top <br>
of the edge. The square of the length of this latter line, the hypotenuse of the triangle, is <br>
25 meters. The square of the length of the line from anchor point to the mid-point of the <br>
edge is 16 meters. So by the Pythagorean theorem, the square of the length of the side <br>
from the edge mid-point to edge top is 9 meters. So the length of the side from the edge <br>
mid-point to edge top is 3 meters. So the edge length is 6 meters.)<br>
<br>
Each discernible part of the edge is represented as occupying positions that vary from <br>
the mid-point distance of 4 meters from the viewer to the distance of the endpoints at 5 meters. <br>
The perceptual representation of the edge as occupying those positions (direction/ <br>
distance), relative to the anchor point, varies smoothly with the positions of the dis cern-<br>
ible parts of the edge, as those parts vary in position from straight-on/4 meters (to the <br>
mid-point) outward to 30-degrees-up-or-down-from-straight-on/5 meters (to the end-<br>
points). The edge-length is not computed by building it up from <i>representations</i> of these <br>
smallest discernible sub-parts. It is computed, perhaps by convergence, as an edge-length <br>
whole, assuming that it has discernible endpoints.<br>
<br>
Now suppose that the bottom of the edge maintains its position, but the edge is slanted <br>
backwards from viewer position, so that the edge’s top is farther away than before. Suppose <br>
that the bottom of the edge remains 30-degrees down and 5 meters away. The mid-point of <br>
the edge is farther away (4 plus <i>m</i> meters away). The top of the edge is in direction 30-minus-<i>n</i> <br>
degrees up, and 5-plus-<i>r</i>-meters away. The positions of the edge’s discernible parts are plotted <br>
(mapped) by the perceptual system, as they vary from bottom to top. The edge, its length, and <br>
its shape are specified in terms of their positions—and those of its discernible parts—in the <br>
coordinate system in the two cases. The orientation varies. The edge, its parts, their lengths, <br>
and their shapes are attributed in ways that entail that they remain constant.<br>
<br>
Since the basic representation of the edge plots its position and those of its discernible <br>
parts in the egocentric coordinate system, the basic ways of representing its length and <br>
shape differ between the frontal-parallel-plane case and the backward-slanted case. Ways <br>
of representing the same attributes differ. Different numerical values in the coordinate sys-<br>
tem and different computations will be used. Both the varying attributes (orientations) <br>
and constant attributes (<i>edge-length</i>, <i>edge-shape</i>) are represented differently, by different <br>
attributives, in the two situations.<br>
<br>
Soon, I will explain that each of the perspective-dependent relational attributes that <br>
vary in these two circumstances (each of the two orientations) can be represented by mul-<br>
tiple relational perceptual attributives in any perceptual system that represents via a spatial <br>
coordinate system. Indeed, every relational attribute, including those for ordinal depth <br>
and distance (from viewer positions) and simple, non-perspectival distance relations <br>
between two perceived entities, can be represented by multiple relational perceptual <br>
attributives in any perceptual system that represents via a spatial coordinate system.<br>
<br>
On our suppositions, the attributives make essential use of numerical plottings of pos-<br>
itions in the coordinate system relative to the system’s anchor position. The specifications </div>
