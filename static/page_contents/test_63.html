responses, not on how a psychology works—on <i>how</i> the cues are processed—the Sterelny-<br>
inspired proposal cannot illumine the nature of the underlying psychological processes.56<br>
<br>
Action drives, but perception <i>is</i>, the emergence of mind. Perception is the first form of <br>
representational mind. Perceptual constancy is the phenomenon that marks the emer-<br>
gence of perception. I investigate perceptual constancy further in the next chapter.<br><br>

<b>FOOTNOTES</b><br>
<b>Cont FN</b>56 Similar points apply to Sterelny’s treatment of “decoupling” of conative from world-tracking states. He cites <br>
Ruth Millikan’s example of meerkat alarm calls when they spot eagles. (Sterelny, <i>Thought in a Hostile World</i>, 29; <br>
R. Millikan, ‘Biosemantics’, <i>The Journal of Philosophy</i> 86 (1989), 281–297.) He follows Millikan in holding that <br>
the linkage between a call and what is done is so tight that it is arbitrary to translate the call as ‘Predator above’ <br>
rather than ‘Run’, or vice-versa. Sterelny also infers (<i>Thought in a Hostile World</i>, 30–35) that in such cases there is <br>
no distinction in the animals’ psychologies between a state that functions to produce action and a state that func-<br>
tions to track the world. This inference seems to me to show a striking lack of familiarity with psychology—espe-<br>
cially perceptual psychology—and to derive again from focusing on external, behavioral matters, without <br>
considering what is known about the underlying psychological architecture. I believe that the distinction <br>
between conative states and sensory states is real <i>prior</i> to emergence of genuine representation—prior to percep-<br>
tion. I think that the distinction is present in animals simpler than arthropods. To the present issue, it is obvi-<br>
ously present in animals capable of perception. A chicken’s perceptual attribution of shape and size can function <br>
to guide a very specific action. But such attributions occur in guiding other actions, and they do not turn off <br>
when no special action is needed. Nor are all visual memories dedicated to specific types of actions. Sterelny <br>
suggests the contrary in his exceptionally odd, and definitely mistaken, discussion of decoupling of world-<br>
tracking and con ation as emerging “fully” only with belief-desire psychology and possibly only in humans.</div><div id="PGHEADER">
