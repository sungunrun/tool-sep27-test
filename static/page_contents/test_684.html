684 Perception and Cognition</div>
<br><br>
This third issue is specifying what counts as a <i>cognitive</i> penetrator and what counts as a <br>
perceptual or perceptual-level system that may be vulnerable to penetration. Here I think that <br>
both scientific and philosophical literatures are a royal mess. Many specialized discussions <br>
circumvent it by focusing on belief or propositional-level intention as candidate penetrators. <br>
Some of these discussions have been sensible. A more general understanding is needed.<br>
<br>
A fourth issue is specifying the causal relation between cognition and perception that is <br>
to count as penetration. (MP) takes as cognitive penetration any causal influence of cogni-<br>
tion on visual processing. MacPherson separately adds that the causation must not be <br>
non-standard. She writes that the causal links must make the content of the perceptual <br>
experience intelligible, or must be ‘in some very minimal sense rational’, in light of the <br>
content of the cognitive state.<br>
<br>
This rider makes a pass at according with Pylyshyn’s nebulously formulated restrictions <br>
on causation. His vague talk of logical connection and semantic coherence plausibly <br>
requires that the connection must not merely be <i>de facto</i> semantically coherent. It must be <br>
coherent based in analogs of structurally good argument. The psychology must make the <br>
connection, not merely have it fall out of a happen-so event. Suppose that one believes that <br>
there will be an explosion with bright lights. Suppose that this belief causes a wave of anx-<br>
iety that produces an illusion of light flashes of the very sort that one might see if there <br>
were an explosion. Such a cause does not count as semantically coherent and logically <br>
connected to the perceptual state. The belief causes the perceptual state. There is a <i>de facto</i> <br>
“semantic coherence” between the two. No one would think that this is cognitive pene tra-<br>
tion. It is pathological causation. Normally, cognitive penetration must be subject to nor-<br>
mal causal explanation of a non-pathological occurrent perceptual (or perceptual-level) <br>
state, and its content, in terms of a cognitive state, and <i>its</i> content.<br>
<br>
Most work on issues of cognitive penetration says little more than I just have. I think <br>
that Pylyshyn and Fodor were trying to get at something that their own formulations do <br>
not capture. I develop this point shortly. Of course, my main interest is not interpreting or <br>
amplifying their views. It is understanding a notion of penetration that accords better than <br>
do most current construals with the practice and scientific understanding of perceptual <br>
and motor psychology.<br><br>

<b>Conceptions of Penetration<br><br>
</div>
</b>In this section, I begin to develop a sharper understanding of penetration. Pylyshyn writes:<br><br>
The sort of influence that concerns us here originates outside the visual system and affects <br>
<br>
the content of visual perception (what is seen) in a certain meaning-dependent way that we <br>
<br>
call cognitive penetration . . . if a system is cognitively penetrable then the function it com-<br>
<br>
putes is sensitive, in a semantically coherent way, to the organism’s goals and beliefs, that is, <br>
<br>
it can be altered in a way that bears some logical relation to what the person knows.1122<br><br>

<b>FOOTNOTES</b><br>
<b>FN</b>1122 Pylyshyn, ‘Is Vision Continuous with Cognition? The Case for Cognitive Impenetrability of Visual <br>
Perception’, 343. Raftopoulos, ‘Pre-Cueing, the Epistemic Role of Early Vision, and the Cognitive Impenetrability <br>
of Early Vision’ and Raftopoulos, <i>Cognitive Penetrability and the Epistemic Role of Perception</i>, are more precise <br>
than Pylyshyn about what to count as early vision. Raftopoulos specifies it in the latter work as the first 150 ms of <br>
