Scope and Modificational Attribution Hierarchy 185</div>
<br><br>
For example, one body might be the reference point for coming to attend to another. <br>
In visual search, one might attend to one item, then, by a shift of attention, one makes a <br>
connection between that item and another one that has been perceived all along.189 Before <br>
attending to the second item, but after having perceived it, reference to the first plausibly <br>
has wider scope. Afterwards, scope priority may shift.<br><br>

<b>Scope and Modificational Attribution Hierarchy<br><br>
</div>
</b>Recall the stock example that I have been using:<br><br>
(that x1)[(that x2)(that x3)(brown(c)(x1), brown(i)(x2), cubical(c)(x1), cubical(i)(x3), <br>
<br>
body(i)(x1))].<br><br>
The perceptual referential application, marked by that x1, has wider scope than the other <br>
two singular applications. That first application functions to single out a body.<br>
<br>
I have been taking the referential application of the attributive body to have wider scope <br>
than referential applications of the shape or color attributives, because it and its guiding <br>
attributive tend have more central roles in attention, memory, tracking, and action. More <br>
broadly, bodies are commonly a psychological locus for holding information of different <br>
types together. For mammals, they tend to be psychologically more central than other <br>
en tities that are perceived. For psychological systems that have the perceptual attributive <br>
body, widest scope for one or more referential applications to body is likely to be the <br>
 normal case.<br>
<br>
Some perceivers surely lack body attributives. Then surfaces may play an analogous role <br>
in their psychologies, or perhaps motions or even certain types of tropes. Very likely, in all <br>
perceptual systems, motions draw attention.<br>
<br>
Normal psychological priority can be altered. Referential applications to shape or color-<br>
instances can dominate over those to bodies or surfaces.<br>
<br>
There can be further scope hierarchies. In the stock example, I present the referential <br>
applications of brown and cubical (marked by ‘2’ and ‘3’) as unordered in their scopes. <br>
In the formula, the order ‘that x2’ and ‘that x3’ is exchangeable. In particular contexts, <br>
 however, secondary referential applications can be scope-ordered. There is some evidence <br>
that with most mobile animals, spatial attributives tend to be more basic to object recogni-<br>
tion, to attention, and to guiding action than color attributives. I discuss these matters <br>
in Chapter 11.<br>
<br>
Such ordering is not rigid. A bee’s psychological system may well, in some contexts, <br>
take perception as of the color as a central topic of attention, action, and memory. In other <br>
contexts, for example, in immediate preparation for landing, perceptual reference to the <br>
shape-instance of a surface might dominate perceptual reference to the color-instance. <br>
Scope reflects such differences.<br><br>
