objects the other ape responds well to. Such associations could lead to the first ape’s <br>
remembering and learning to group those types of objects. The ape could well per cep-<br>
tual ly attribute <i>gift</i> to any particular in the grouping. Gift shapes might be disparate. It <br>
might be impossible to forecast the grouping from our intuitive sense of shape-similarity. <br>
A perceptual, or perceptual-level, attributive for <i>mate</i> is not only possible. It is almost cer-<br>
tain. The authors’ conflation of perceptual reference with perceptual attribution is here <br>
supplemented by an empiricist assumption that perceptual attributives cannot apply to <br>
perceptually dissimilar instances, according to an intuitive conception of perceptual simi-<br>
larity. These two mistakes yield ungrounded limitations on what attributives a perceptual <br>
system can produce and an ungrounded conception of what counts as cognition or as a <br>
concept.<br>
<br>
The authors’ broader idea that whereas one cannot perceive unperceivables, one can <br>
conceive of unperceivables, is, of course, correct. Some gifts and all macro-mates can be <br>
perceived. One cannot perceive quarks, perceptions, or numbers. There are reasons to be <br>
careful in applying this broader idea that go beyond those given in the preceding <br>
paragraph.<br>
<br>
One reason is that although one cannot perceive things in the past or future as past or <br>
future, one can represent them in these ways with non-conceptual, perceptual attributives. <br>
One can even single them out with perceptual-level referential applications in <i>de re</i> per-<br>
ceptual memory or <i>de re</i> perceptual anticipation. (See Chapters 17 and 18.) So it would be <br>
a mistake to argue that since one cannot perceive a future effect of a presently perceived <br>
cause, one cannot attribute, at the perceptual level, causal relations between perceived <br>
causes and future effects.<br>
<br>
It would also be a mistake to argue that one cannot attribute at the perceptual level a <br>
causal relation between an unperceived cause and a presently perceived effect.1169 A hypo-<br>
thetical perceiver with a perceptual attributive for causal relations could be exposed to a <br>
series of cause-effect relations in which both cause and effect are perceived. Suppose that <br>
the sequence comes to be perceptually tracked <i>as</i> causal. As indicated in Chapter 12, it is <br>
not established that there are perceptual attributives for causation. But as far as is known, <br>
there could be. They seem likely. Suppose that there are perceptual attributives for causes <br>
and effects. Enough exposure and regularity could yield an association between cause-<br>
type and effect-type that is stored in long-term, generic perceptual memory. Suppose that <br>
an event is perceived that fits the effect type, but the cause is not perceived. Perhaps the <br>
cause is occluded. The perceiver could have a schematic perceptual-level anticipation as of <br>
an object of a type that normally figures in the causing event-type. Then there could be a <br>
perceptual-level representation that attributes a causal relation between a schematically <br>
represented unperceived cause and a perceived effect.<br><br>
