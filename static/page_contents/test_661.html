Fodor and Pylyshyn’s Conceptions of Modularity 661</div>
<br><br>
Pylyshyn’s failure to set a good example in his own use and explication of ‘cognition’ is <br>
manifest in his discussion of categorization. He takes categorization, which occurs for him <br>
outside early vision, to be or to involve cognition. He provides only the most cursory <br>
motivation for this view. He writes that categorization requires ‘accessing memory and <br>
making judgments’ (351). He writes that category identity is ‘inextricably linked to past <br>
encounters and to what one knows about members of the category (e.g. what properties—<br>
visual and nonvisual—they have)’ (361). He takes perceiving something as a face to be a <br>
type of categorization, and takes categorization to be similar to perceiving something as <br>
Mary’s face and identifying some stimulus as one’s sister.1074<br>
<br>
These passages mix different psychological kinds in an almost indiscriminate way. For <br>
example, Pylyshyn assumes without argument that all memory (or sometimes, just long-<br>
term memory) retains propositional knowledge.1075 Some memory does. Some memory, <br>
including some long-term memory, does not. (See Chapters 16–17.) Perceptual memory, <br>
whether short-term or long-term, does not retain knowledge. Standardly understood, <br>
knowledge requires belief. Beliefs are propositional. The retained representations in per-<br>
ceptual memory are not propositional. Further, not all perceptual categorization depends <br>
on use of stored representations by any sort of memory. First-formed categorizations are <br>
memory-free. (See Chapters 10–11.)<br>
<br>
Pylyshyn takes categorization to require judgments, where ‘judgment’ is naturally taken <br>
to apply to a propositional state, analogous to belief. No current account of perceptual <br>
categorization appeals to judgment. Even when memory is involved in categorization, it is <br>
enough to associate an incoming perceptual representation of a specifically shaped body, <br>
or body-part, with a perceptual template stored in perceptual memory. Such associations <br>
are not judgments. Pylyshyn vastly over-intellectualized—over-cognitivized!—perceptual <br>
categorization.<br>
<br>
Similarly, perceiving something as a face, even as a specifically shaped face with a sense <br>
of familiarity, and tracked from earlier encounters, a face that is in fact Mary’s, differs from <br>
identifying something <i>as</i> Mary’s face using a proper name. The former type of cat egor iza-<br>
tion is not necessarily cognitive. It is now widely accepted in the science that such cat egor-<br>
iza tion can be perceptual. Much categorization depends on stored perceptual templates, <br>
which can function to signal familiarity and can figure in tracking individuals. As argued <br>
in Chapter 17, not all memory is knowledge, belief, or supra-perceptual. Identification of <br>
Mary’s face <i>as</i> Mary’s, using a proper name—requires language. Our best science indicates <br>
that non-linguistic perceptual categorization and re-identification are not necessarily cog-<br>
nitive. Similarly, identification of something as one’s sister’s face is different from cat egor-<br>
iz ing a very specific face in terms of its spatial properties in a way that functions to track <br>
an individual as familiar and who is in fact one’s sister. Of course, it is not even obvious <br>
that all functional attributives that indicate <i>sister</i> are cognitive.<br>
<br>
Influenced by the scientific view, common until the late 1990s and early 2000s, that true <br>
perception stops short of categorization, Pylyshyn runs together different psychological <br>
kinds in his over-cursory explanation of categorization as ‘inevitably’ cognitive.<br><br>
