composing representations of longer lines. Representations of longer lines with natural <br>
endpoints usually are representationally primitive. They accommodate iconic representa-<br>
tions of smaller, contained line segments, which lack any natural endpoints, by represent-<br>
ing them <i>as</i> parts of the “natural” longer line. Each represented part is distinguished by its <br>
represented position in the longer line.<br>
<br>
Perceptual representation of spatial parts usually works that way. What is representa-<br>
tionally primitive depends on what representational competencies are fundamental. <br>
Perceptual competence to distinguish lines with natural endpoints is certainly more fun-<br>
damental than competence to distinguish the various parts that lack natural boundaries. <br>
Representing spatial parts of natural wholes by representing them as parts of the wholes is <br>
compatible with the known fact that, in visual perception, representations of lines with <br>
natural endpoints are formed through combining pre-perceptual information regis tra-<br>
tions of smaller edge segments.358 One must distinguish <i>information registration</i> of very <br>
small edge segments in proximal stimulation (in the visual image) from <i>representation</i> of <br>
very small parts of environmental lines with natural endpoints. The former is first in the <br>
order of perception-formation. The latter is usually derivative in the structure of percep-<br>
tual representation.<br>
<br>
Iconic representations, like all representations, represent by being a product of compe-<br>
tence and use. Representational structure marks the representational functions of the psy-<br>
cho logic al competencies. Representational structure is found by investigating the uses by <br>
and competencies of those who use the representations. Iconicity is an aspect of represen-<br>
tational format, not a determiner of basic representational functions. The basic represen-<br>
tational functions of iconic representation—reference and attribution—occur in non-iconic <br>
language and non-iconic thought. Most linguistic representational contents are not iconic. <br>
Modes of presentation and representational content mark types of competence. Iconic and <br>
non-iconic competencies are psychologically different. The basic representational functions <br>
and structures are shared.<br>
<br>
Reliance of iconic perceptual representation on natural relations between the representa-<br>
tion and the represented subject matter is evolutionarily very old. That is where representa-<br>
tion begins. Representation begins by capitalizing on nature’s stamping itself directly into a <br>
creature’s sensory capacities. This stamping is illustrated by the retinotopic maps discussed <br>
in the section Iconic Aspects of Perceptual Spatial Representation. It is <br>
natural that patterns stamped into pre-perceptual sensory cap aci ties are co-opted in per-<br>
ceptual representation. I think that natural perception could not work any other way and <br>
remain natural. The structural correspondences that result from the stamping—inasmuch <br>
as they are reliable—contribute not only to primitive representation, but also to primitive <br>
ancestors of epistemic warrant and knowledge.<br>
<br>
The discussion of empirical reasons for regarding perceptual representation to take over <br>
the iconicity of sensory states in the section Iconic Aspects of Perceptual <br>
Spatial Representation illustrates the fact that natural perception makes use of the <br>
iconicity of the underlying sensory registration.<br><br>
