Primitive Attribution of Mechanical Causation 465</div>
<br><br>
perceptual grouping of spatio-temporal-motion patterns that signal causation is a differ-<br>
ent grouping from any representation of the slip events, the different perceptual attribu-<br>
tives have different adaptation potentials. We already know that perceptual groupings <br>
adapt. It is no surprise that adaptation operates on the perceptual grouping or perceptual <br>
attributive that is of greater psychological focus and interest. Attribution of causation is <br>
different from, though triggered by, attribution of the relevant spatio-temporal-motion <br>
patterns, even as perceptually grouped into a genus. Attribution of causation will adapt if <br>
the underlying, triggering perceptual grouping of spatio-temporal-motion patterns adapts.<br>
<br>
There is no question that the spatio-temporal-motion patterns are perceptually grouped <br>
as salient <i>because</i> they normally signal causation—an ecologically important environmen-<br>
tal feature. It does not follow that attribution of causation is itself generated by the visual <br>
perceptual system. Given that the relevant empirical attribution of causation depends <br>
causally, in representation-formation, directly on perceptual attribution of spatio-<br>
temporal-motion patterns, the location of primitive attribution of causation could be <br>
either perceptual or supra-perceptual.<br>
<br>
So I think that these ingenious experiments do not show that primitive attribution of <br>
mechanical causation is perceptual. Still, I think that the experiments suggest reasons to <br>
anticipate that primitive attribution of causation <i>is</i> perceptual.<br>
<br>
What would show that attribution of causation, as distinguished from its perceptual <br>
application base—attribution of the spatio-temporal-motion patterns—is generated by the <br>
visual system? I think reasons for conjecturing that primitive attribution of causation is <br>
perceptual are two-fold. First, causation is so basic to negotiating the world that it is plaus-<br>
ible that natural selection pushed causal representation to as early a level of processing as <br>
possible. Simple forms of mechanical causation are directly and reliably signaled by per-<br>
ceivable spatio-temporal-motion patterns, thus easily available to perceptual systems of <br>
sufficient complexity. It therefore seems broadly plausible that perceptual systems in corp-<br>
or ated representation of causation by forming dispositions to perceptually anticipate <br>
causal asymmetries when relevant spatio-temporal patterns are grouped for perceptual <br>
attribution. Second, it is plausible that computation of perceptual representation of caus-<br>
ation and of such anticipational representation of asymmetrical causal roles would be no <br>
more complex than other computations in the visual system that are already known to <br>
occur. Computation of exercise of such capacities seems not more complex than computa-<br>
tion of body representation and associated anticipations from attributions of certain types <br>
of shape. However, I think that until such computational models are proposed and given <br>
specific empirical support, it remains an informed conjecture that primitive representa-<br>
tion of causation is perceptual.<br>
<br>
The representational form of a perceptual representation of unoccluded mechanical <br>
causation would be something like:<br><br>
(here-cego x0)(that x1)(that x2)(that x3)(that x4)<br>
<br>
[bodyd1(i)(x1), movementm1(i)(x2), byz3(c)(x2, x1), bodyd2(i)(x3), movementm4(i)(x4), <br>
<br>
byz5(c)(x4, x3),<br>
<br>
fromx1(c)(x2, p1, p2, x0), fromx7(c)(x4, p2, p3, x0), contactw5(c)(x1, x3, p2), causesu5(c)(x2, x4)]<br><br>
‘Movementm1’ applies to events and is read, ‘is a movement’. ‘From(x2, p1, p2, x0)’ is read ‘x2 <br>
from place l to place 2, relative to x0’, where x2 is a movement event. ‘contact(x1, x3, p2)’ is AQ:1</div>
