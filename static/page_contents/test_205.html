Perceptual Contents, Propositions, and Noun Phrases 205</div>
<br><br>
In perception, attribution never outranks reference. So a main-verb-phrase attributive <br>
is a new semantical element in propositional representation. Such an element is a repre-<br>
sentational competence. New explanatory kinds—new representational competencies—<br>
should not be postulated if old ones ground explanation equally well. Explanation in <br>
perceptual psychology need not, and does not, postulate propositional structures. Such <br>
structures mark a different representational function and competence than any function <br>
or competence marked in perception.<br>
<br>
There are large differences between noun phrases and perceptual kinds. The point is not <br>
that perceptual kinds <i>are</i> noun phrases. It is two-fold. First, perceptual states have the same <br>
representational function that certain noun phrases have—noun phrases governed by con-<br>
textual, referentially used determiners. Second, at a certain level of abstraction, perceptions <br>
have a representational form that is shared with noun phrases and that reflects that function.<br>
<br>
This comparison regarding representational form is emphatically not meant to suggest <br>
that noun-phrases are more basic than perceptual representational contents. I believe the <br>
contrary. Relevant noun phrases get their referential form through having a picking-out, <br>
referential function. The phylogenetically, ontogenetically, and epistemically basic type of <br>
reference is perceptual. In infants’ acquisition of language, noun phrases first function to <br>
refer by leaning on perception.<br>
<br>
Let us consider differences between noun phrases and perceptual representational contents.<br>
<br>
Noun phrases acquire their meaning conventionally or intentionally, and are essentially <br>
linguistic. Their shapes or sounds could, in themselves, mean almost anything. They are <br>
conventionally symbolic.<br>
<br>
Perceptual kinds have their content—are what they are—through natural interactions <br>
with the environment, prior to language. In perception, contents are not expressed by <br>
symbols, in any ordinary sense of ‘symbol’. Perceptual contents do not depend on any sort <br>
of conventionality. There is no evident role in perception for a symbolic vehicle of content, <br>
<i>whose identity as a vehicle is not constitutively associated with the content</i>. (See Chapter 4, <br>
the section Perception, Computation, and the Language-of-Thought <br>
Hypothesis.) Perceptual states are constitutively determined by their representational <br>
content, together with their mode (visual perception, for example).<br>
<br>
Noun phrases are spoken or written as a string of symbols in a linear spatial order. <br>
Perceptual contents are not structured in a linear way. They have the format of iconic <br>
matrices.<br>
<br>
Noun phrases have a function to occur, and normally do occur, as part of a larger string <br>
of symbols or characters, where the larger (propositional) string does not have the struc-<br>
ture of a noun phrase. In perception, perceptual contents are never embedded in larger <br><br>

<b>FOOTNOTES</b><br>
<b>Cont FN</b>What is distinctive about main-verb-phrase-like occurrences of attributives in <i>propositional</i> structures is that <br>
they are outside the scope of any referential application. (Note that relational perceptual attributives, like all per-<br>
ceptual attributives, always occur inside the scope of a referential application.) What is important and distinctive <br>
about attributives in propositional structures—<i>conceptual attributives</i>—is (a) that every one of them <i>can</i> occur in <br>
a representational content outside the scope of any referential application, and (b) that in every propositional <br>
structure at least one of them does occur outside such scope. Again, the key to understanding propositional <br>
structure deeply is to understand the psychological competencies that ground the representational form: spe cif-<br>
ic al ly, the capacity for scope-dominance of conceptual attributives (the analog of Aristotle’s copula), which I <br>
believe to be partly explicable in terms of a capacity for propositional inference. Representational form depends <br>
on representational function. Both depend on representational competence. Understanding the specific psy cho-<br>
logic al competencies that underlie the forms distinctive of propositional states is the project of another work.</div>
