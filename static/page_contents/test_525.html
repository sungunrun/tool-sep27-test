inaccuracy (or variability) are costs. By giving up speed, one’s reach may be more accurate <br>
and less variable. By taking time to fixate a target, accuracy of perception can be improved. <br>
Is there a benefit that supports incurring the costs? Such issues are settled on a task-<br>
dependent basis. Experimentation elicits what cost–benefit weightings figure as prior con-<br>
ditions in issuing motor commands. Motor systems operate near optimally, given plausible <br>
antecedent assessments of Bayesian maximizations of utility.719<br>
<br>
Studies of motor operations force interesting complications in the account that I have <br>
sketched. Various actions have been studied in great detail—walking, setting posture, <br>
pointing, standing up, reaching, grasping, writing, skiing, shooting. Two striking facts <br>
mark these activities. One is the reliability of success in meeting targets. The other is the <br>
variability in the movements that lead to meeting the targets. The fact that the same target <br>
is met differently is called ‘<i>redundancy</i>’. The <i>redundancy problem</i> is that of explaining how <br>
given action trajectories are determined on specific occasions, given that many trajectories <br>
occur over a series of trials.<br>
<br>
Of course, different movement trajectories have different starting points. If your target <br>
is to grasp a given object, and your hand starts on your lap, the trajectory differs from <br>
when your hand starts on a table. Even if an individual’s hand starts at the same place on <br>
consecutive trials, there is large variability in the trajectories that the hand follows in dif-<br>
ferent cases in grasping an object. Internal noise is a principal factor in the variability, but <br>
there are certainly others.<br>
<br>
Some models of motor movement failed to account for this variability. Some postulated <br>
an optimal trajectory and a sequence of trajectory corrections that apply when a deviation <br>
from the trajectory occurs. Detailed studies of the form of variability count against such <br>
models. Variability is considerable when variation from average behavior (or from an ideal ly <br>
direct trajectory) does not affect meeting the target. Dramatically less variability occurs <br>
when a variation affects success in meeting a target. This fact suggests that the system reduces <br>
variability via sensory feedback when and only when accuracy in meeting a set target is <br>
needed, and that the system allows variability that does not affect carrying out the set task.720 <br>
A corollary is that there is no need to compute a difference from a given trajectory at each <br>
stage of sensorimotor processing and to correct for the errors, or de vi ations from an optimal <br>
trajectory, as long as the trajectory would meet the set target. A single program for when and <br>
how much variations in trajectory are to be corrected can be set in advance, though imple-<br>
mentation of the corrections must occur in response to vari ations online.721<br>
<br>
Such a model accords well with serious thinking about optimal design. Correction <br>
requires effort, or energy expenditure. Effort is a cost. The Bayesian form of the model <br><br>
