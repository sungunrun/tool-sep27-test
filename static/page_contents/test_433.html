<b>Further Attributives: Primitive Attribution  <br><br>

more than what we see with our own eyes, there is another in which it proves <br>

to us how little our eyes permit us to see.<br>

In this chapter I discuss methodological issues in determining whether there are further <br>
perceptual attributives beyond the types already discussed. I consider two illustrative <br>
cases—attributives for causation and for agency.<br><br>

<b>Methodology for Finding Perceptual Attributives<br><br>
</div>
</b>In philosophy and parts of psychology, there is an insistent bias toward counting as per-<br>
ceptual numerous ranges of attributives. In mainstream visual perceptual psychology, a <br>
small range of types is so far accepted. These are attributives for spatial properties and <br>
relations—such as shape and location—, temporal relations, motion, color and lightness, <br>
body and body-parts. Of course, numerous sub-species of these attributive types (includ-<br>
ing sub-species that count as categorizations) are included. An empirical question is <br>
whether there are further types of visual perceptual attributives—beyond those on the <br>
list—<i>attributives produced in the visual perceptual system</i>. Progress on the issue is in its <br>
early days. Attribution of size is better understood than attribution of surface shape, which <br>
is understood better than attribution of 3-D volume shape. It is an ongoing issue whether <br>
further types of attributives should be added to the list.<br>
<br>
Of course, empirically applying many attributives not on the list depends on applying <br>
accepted visual perceptual attributives. A technician can judge that body is an x-ray <br>
machine, on the basis a perception that attributes a certain shape and size, and the kind <br>
<i>body</i>. It does not follow that the attributive x-ray machine is produced in the visual system. <br>
It is more likely to be produced only in a propositionally structured conceptual system. <br>
Having the attributive depends on minimally understanding what an x-ray machine is, or <br>
at least on talking with someone who does. Recognitional applications of the attributive <br>
are probably triggered through causal links between perception and capacities embedded <br>
in the system of propositional attitudes. Then x-ray machine would be a perceptually <br>
applicable attributive, but not a perceptual attributive.<br>
<br>
These issues are resolved mainly through inference to the best explanation. As indi-<br>
cated, being competent with x-ray machine requires competencies known not to be per-<br>
ceptual. In perceptual psychology, the key issue is whether formation of a candidate </div>
