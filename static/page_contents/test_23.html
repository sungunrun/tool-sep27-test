Representation and Information Registration 23</div>
<br><br>
The formula allows that time is sensed, even though neither time nor instances of time <br>
cause anything. Time causally co-varies with sensory states inasmuch as events sequenced <br>
in time cause the sensory states and time co-varies with those causal sequences, and this <br>
causal co-variance is functional for the organism.<br>
<br>
It is understood that the functionality cited in the explication of information registra-<br>
tion is broadly practical. Broadly practical functions include biological functions and <br>
 artifactual functions. Information registration occurs only in living things and certain <br>
artifacts. Neither the church bell’s ringing in conjunction with the rooster’s crowing nor <br>
the shadow of the rock cast by the sun is functional. A plant’s growth toward the sun <br>
caused by the light of the sun is functional for the plant. The notion of information regis-<br>
tration is relevant to understanding many biological phenomena. Included among such <br>
phenomena are the sensory states of animals.<br>
<br>
Information registration has sometimes been confused with representation, where ‘rep-<br>
resentation’ is understood in a psychologically distinctive sense, to be explained. One basis <br>
for the confusion is that the notion of function brings in teleology, hence success and fail-<br>
ure. A state that registers information about something can on a particular occasion fail to <br>
realize its function of doing so. Success and failure also figure in representation. <br>
Representations can be accurate or inaccurate, true or false. It is easy to conflate the func-<br>
tional failure of an information-registrational state with the state’s being false or in ac cur-<br>
ate. The fact that information registration is relevant to understanding and explaining <br>
sensory states and the fact that sensory states can fail to realize their biological functions <br>
easily suggest that information registration <i>is</i> representation. Confusion of information <br>
registration with representation is further encouraged by conflating sensing with perceiv-<br>
ing, and with assuming that sensing is a distinctively <i>psychological</i> capacity.<br>
<br>
I henceforth use ‘<i>representation</i>’ without qualification to indicate representation in a <br>
distinctively psychological sense that allows literal accuracy, inaccuracy, truth, or falsity.<br>
<br>
Information registration is a valuable theoretical notion. It can be used in functional <br>
explanations of a great variety of biological, bio-psychological, and social phenomena. The <br>
mistake lies in thinking that it is <i>the</i> core of psychological explanation. In fact, it is not a <br>
distinctively psychological notion at all. It is used in plant biology and the biology of <br>
micro-organisms as well as in psychology. Focusing on it as the core of psychological <br>
explanation amounts to ignoring the central psychological representational notions. It <br>
amounts to ignoring the most powerful and advanced psychological science—perceptual <br>
psychology. It also ignores how developmental psychology and the psychology of higher <br>
psychological capacities actually operate.<br>
<br>
Whole programs of explanation have rested on identifying information registration <br>
with representation, and claiming or assuming that the notion of information registration <br>
is the core notion in psychological explanation.20<br><br>
