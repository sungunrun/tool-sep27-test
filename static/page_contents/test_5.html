explained in terms of summations of changes that occur in plant cells. There is no need to <br>
postulate a central locus of conation, as we do for agents.<br>
<br>
Some speak metaphorically, even poetically, of sensing and acting by plants. Some sci-<br>
entists like to say that plants communicate with one another. Perhaps there is a broad <br>
enough notion of communication to allow such talk to be non-metaphorical. I believe that <br>
any such communication is not action. Calling functional, cross-individual patterns of <br>
sensitivity and response among plants ‘communication’ serves advertisement more than <br>
understanding. True understanding depends more here on exploring differences than on <br>
engaging in assimilation.<br>
<br>
I think that serious conceptual and scientific investigation of these matters will confirm <br>
some variant of what common sense assumes. Plants may communicate. They do not act. <br>
Some or all animals, and perhaps other organisms that are neither plants nor animals, do.<br>
<br>
I think that action has to do with a coordination among central capacities of an <br>
organism—typically, but not necessarily, endogenously causing movement by the  individual.2 <br>
I conjecture that plants do not act because their changes are too easily explained as a <br>
 summation or aggregation of changes in plant parts. Photo-synthesis occurs in every <br>
plant cell. Growth is not action partly because it is a summation of aggregate increases <br>
in various cells. Directionality in growth stems from the fact that more stimulated cells <br>
multiply faster. Plants are sensitive to light. Relevant stimulation for growth is often from <br>
light. Plants grow toward the light. Directional growth is an aggregate response of changes <br>
in the plant’s most stimulated cells. This is not action. Similarly, for absorption of water <br>
and nutrients. Such absorption is not eating. These points are at best a gesture at a position <br>
on a complicated topic.<br>
<br>
I take the notion of <i>sensing</i>, as distinct from that of <i>sensitivity</i>, to be tied to action. <br>
Plants are sensitive to stimuli. Animals sense stimuli. Sensing and action emerge <br>
together.3<br>
<br>
The distinction between plant responses and animal (or other organisms) action is not <br>
central to the present project. It is background. What I have pointed to is a broad analogy <br>
between plant sensitivity and functional growth-like responses, on one hand, and animal <br>
sensing and functional behavioral responses that include action, on the other.<br>
<br>
The sensing-action nexus is very old, older than the emergence of mind. Organisms <br>
that surely lack minds—paramecia, simple worms, snails—act. They eat, swim, or crawl. <br>
They depend on elementary sensing capacities in fulfilling these activities’ functions.<br>
<br>
Here again, biological functions of the organism are to be distinguished from biological <br>
functions of organs and operations within the organism. For example, eating, mating, <br>
swimming, crawling, and navigating are biological functions of the whole animal. All <br>
meet earlier-discussed conditions for being a biological function. All depend for being <br>
functional on the well-functioning operation of biological systems or organs within the <br>
organism. For example, eating’s fulfilling its function depends on the well-functioning <br>
operation of a digestive system. The whole-animal functions are relevant to understanding <br>
success and failure for the whole animal, not just sub-systems or sub-parts of the animal. <br>
Acting and sensing are functional pursuits at the level of the whole animal. They form the <br>
womb out of which basic forms of mind are born.<br><br>
