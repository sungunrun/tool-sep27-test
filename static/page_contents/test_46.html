are instantiations or exercises of schematic singular (or plural) referential competencies. <br>
They are applications of, as well as exercises of, the schematic demonstrative-like that, or <br>
of the schematic indexicals ego-here, or ego-now. Their function is to pick out particulars. <br>
In perception, in order to pick out particulars via causal relations to the particulars, they <br>
must be guided by one or more attributives. So the referential applications are also refer-<br>
ential applications of perceptual attributives. In fact, attribution of perceptual attributives <br>
to particulars in perception is the same thing as referential perceptual applications of the <br>
perceptual attributives. These are two descriptions of the same type of event or occurrence.<br>
<br>
In perception, two <i>general</i> competencies are exercised. One is the schematic referential <br>
competence. The other is the attributive competence. As noted, the latter comprises both <br>
indication and attribution. An occurrence-based referential application event is an exer-<br>
cise of the standing schematic referential competence. It is also an exercise of the standing <br>
attributional competence. Referential applications in perception just are applications of <br>
perceptual attributives. They are simultaneously exercises of reference and exercises of <br>
attribution. Neither perceptual referential application nor perceptual attribution can occur <br>
without the other. All perceptual attributions are through perceptual referential applica-<br>
tions. All perceptual referential applications are applications of perceptual attributives. In <br>
successful perception, at least one such attributive is veridical of the perceived particulars. <br>
I support and elaborate these points in Chapter 5.<br>
<br>
Intuitively, a perceptual state has a singular aspect and a general aspect. The singular <br>
aspect is the occurrent exercise of perceptual capacities. It is that occurrent exercise in <br>
response to a stimulus that picks out particulars in the environment. The perceptual <br>
capacities, at the most generic level, are the capacity to pick out particulars and the cap-<br>
acity to characterize them by responding representationally to repeatable patterns in the <br>
environment. Referential applications are singular exercises, simultaneously of those two <br>
generic abilities. Referential applications function to apply attributives in the service of <br>
picking out particulars, relying on occurrent causal chains through stimuli back to the <br>
perceived—picked out—particulars.<br>
<br>
I believe that it is apriori that perception contains exactly these three generic types of <br>
representational constituents: perceptual referential applications, perceptual schemas <br>
(demonstrative-like and usually also indexical), and perceptual attributives. They cor res-<br>
pond to the two ability-general types of competence that perception necessarily and apri-<br>
ori has—attributive abilities and referential abilities, and to the contextual application of <br>
these abilities that is required for the contextual causal-based reference that is involved in <br>
perceiving particulars. So all perceptual states involve two types of capacities—those for <br>
reference and attribution—and one type of event—referential application—that brings <br>
about a simultaneous exercise of both capacities. A perceptual state commonly includes a <br>
multitude of attributive capacities and a corresponding multitude of referential applica-<br>
tions of them.<br>
<br>
The presence of referential applications in perception follows from the apriori neces-<br>
sary fact that perception functions to pick out particulars partly through contextual (hence <br>
occurrent) causal relations to particulars. I think it apriori that perceptual referential <br>
applications must be exercises of standing perceptual referential competencies. That fact <br>
guarantees the presence of schematic representational elements. In Chapter 5, I argue <br>
apriori for the necessary presence, in all perception, of attributives that guide referential <br>
applications. Showing that no other basic representational elements enter into perception </div>
