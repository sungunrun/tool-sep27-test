608 Perceptual Memory: Short-Term Systems</div>

question whether CSTM is a system distinct from long-term memory, or rather an acti-<br>
vated part of long-term memory that includes new connections that are sometimes avail-<br>
able to conscious access for short-periods of time.939 I have discussed it as a distinct, earlier <br>
system, for the sake of vividness.<br>
<br>
Repetition is another factor in yielding higher rates of long-term remembering. Recall <br>
that saccades occur about 3 times a second. When objects are presented intermittently for <br>
durations of single fixations (about 250 ms), fleeting memories can be stabilized. After 8 <br>
separated fixations, recognition memory after 30 minutes is as good as memory during an <br>
immediate memory test. With shorter exposures, more exposures are needed to yield <br>
longer-term memories.940 So repetition is a factor in long-term memories’ being generated <br>
from memories in CSTM. Repetition of fixation across saccades is common when scenes <br>
are stable and the viewer is stationary. Repetition plays a large role in long-term memory’s <br>
retention of huge numbers of perceptual attributives.<br>
<br>
Longer exposure times in the formation of initial perceptions is another factor in yield-<br>
ing long-term memories. Hundreds of pictures shown for 1–3 seconds apiece pass through <br>
CSTM into long-term memory at very high rates, as long as the later recognition test does <br>
not include new pictures that are very similar to the to-be-remembered old pictures.941<br>
<br>
Attention is, of course, a further factor in the passage of perceptual representations <br>
through CSTM or working memory into long-term memory. Even non-fixated but <br>
attended items have a better chance of being retained in long-term memory.<br>
<br>
The limited storage capacity of working memory may be partly an artifact of interfer-<br>
ence characteristics of particular research designs. All types of memory are subject to <br>
some decay. The storage-capacity features and decay-rate features that have been thought <br>
to distinguish shorter-and longer-term types of memory may not be as sharply different <br>
as has been commonly thought. Certain types of short-term memory—including CSTM <br>
and working memory—may perhaps grade into long-term memory, rather than being dif-<br>
ferent memory systems.942 These are speculative possibilities, far from settled in current <br>
scientific work.<br>
<br>
I have lingered over relations between types of short-term and long-term memory for <br>
two reasons. One is that they bear on the momentous question of how perceptual attributives <br>
are conceptualized, or otherwise connected to conceptual attributives. Although thoughts can <br>
be almost as short-term as perceptions, we tend to be especially interested in thoughts and <br>
concepts that are available over longer periods of time than short-term memories. The <br>
other is that the relations show that retention in long-term <i>perceptual</i> memory does not in <br>
itself constitute advent of a supra-perceptual form of representation. Association with <br>
antecedent perceptual structure, repetition, long exposure, and attention initiations are <br>
not intrinsically supra-perceptual operations.<br><br>
