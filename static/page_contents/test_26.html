26 Perception</div>
<br><br>
Information registration occurs in plants and animals. I say that plants are <i>sensitive</i> to what <br>
they informationally register, whereas animals <i>sense</i> what they informationally register. <br>
Sensing is a sub-species of information registration. Roughly, sensing is information registra-<br>
tion that causes behavioral, including whole-organism, functional responses that are actions. <br>
Although not all behavior is action, I conjecture that an organism does not engage in behav-<br>
ior, or have a capacity to sense things, unless it sometimes engages in active behavior.23<br>
<br>
I now summarize the distinction between information registration and representation. <br>
Information registration is causally based correlation with a broadly practical function, <br>
principally for our purposes a biological function. It entails nothing about representation <br>
or veridicality. Representation and veridicality entail nothing about biological functions. <br>
The relation between representation and veridicality (and between representation and <br>
representational function) is less simple and direct than the relation between information <br>
and biological function. I articulate this relation in due course. It suffices at this juncture <br>
to say that representation bears a constitutive, conceptual relation to conditions for ver idi-<br>
cal ity and non-veridicality.<br>
<br>
All perception in natural organisms is not only representation; it involves information <br>
registration. In principle, however, perception could be carried out by entities that have no <br>
biological functions. Quite a of information registration is not representation. The two <br>
notions are not extensionally equivalent. They apply to different cases.<br>
<br>
I have intimated that the conceptual distinction bears on the types of explanation that <br>
information registration and representation enter into. Explanation in terms of informa-<br>
tion registration is functional explanation. It elicits ways in which connection to specific <br>
aspects of the environment are functional for the organism. Such functional explanations <br>
can be supplemented by causal physiological explanations, or computational explanations <br>
that are at a more abstract level than physiological explanations. Although some individ-<br>
ual scientists make meta-comments about information-registrational states that treat <br>
them as veridical or not (see note 46), such comments are not integrated into basic pat-<br>
terns of scientific causal explanation that appeal to veridicality. By contrast, explanations <br>
in terms of representation—specifically in perceptual psychology—take the relevant states <br>
to have veridicality conditions—that is, to be capable of being accurate or inaccurate. Such <br>
explanations are commonly causal and computational.<br>
<br>
The distinction between information registration and representation is conceptual. It <br>
figures in serious scientific explanation. It also shows up in how widely the two notions <br>
apply. The difference is dramatic. Information registration occurs in all living things. It <br>
occurs in relations between plant cells and light, in relations between sensors for constric-<br>
tion in blood vessels and changes in heartbeat. It figures in relations between states of <br>
bacteria and darkness, in relations between states of a paramecium’s gullet and food that <br>
contacts the gullet, in relations between an earthworm’s heat sensors and heat. It is a factor <br>
in relations of perceptual states and aspects of the environment. Understanding ‘function’ <br>
to cover not only biological functions but artifactual functions, information registration <br>
occurs in states of water pumps calibrated to respond to levels of water. The notion of <br>
information registration applies much more widely than that of representation. The notion <br>
of information registration is in no sense distinctively psychological.<br><br>

out of fright is not action. Its running is action. I explain the notion in slightly more depth in Chapter 14, below.</div>
