epistemically, and informationally different, even though the worldly condition that makes <br>
them veridical is the same.32<br>
<br>
Representational contents as veridicality conditions ground semantical explanation. <br>
The representational structure, or form, of the contents is a central focus of our discussion. <br>
The form of the representational contents depends on their and their parts’ representa-<br>
tional functions. That form sets conditions under which a psychological state’s content is <br>
veridical or not. It should be kept firmly in mind that the representational contents that <br>
constitute veridicality conditions are psychological kinds. Components of the contents are <br>
psychological competencies (or, in some cases, exercises of competencies) with specific <br>
representational functions. So representational form follows representational function. <br>
Representational functions are grounded in psychological competencies or capacities. The <br>
functions are the representational functions <i>of competencies</i>.<br><br>

</div>
</b>A central objective of the book is to understand the representational form or structure of <br>
perceptual representational contents. The form is, of course, that of veridicality conditions <br>
and representational kinds. I reiterate: representational form follows representational <br>
function, which is, in turn, grounded in and realized by psychological states and compe-<br>
tencies. I begin here with general reflection on the representational functions of percep-<br>
tual states and competencies. I make the most general points here. Chapters 5–8 elaborate.<br>
<br>
The representation function of a perceptual state is to be accurate. More specifically, the <br>
representational function of a perceptual state is to pick out particulars in a way that per-<br>
ceptually characterizes them. The representational form of perceptual states must be <br>
understood by reference to this representational function.<br>
<br>
Recall that particulars are non-repeatable. Perceptual states pick out particulars, local-<br>
ized in time and in space, partly by being appropriately caused by the particulars, and <br>
partly by characterizing them perceptually. Perception of non-repeatable particulars <br>
derives from the exercise of perceptual competencies in response to being causally affected <br>
by the particulars.33 Picking out particulars depends only partly on characterizing them. It <br>
also depends on being in an appropriate causal relation to them. Characterization can nar-<br>
row the field to a certain type of entity. But perceptual reference—perceptual picking out <br>
of particulars—is not carried out purely by repeatable, ability-general capacities or compe-<br>
tencies. It is carried out by the exercise of a general, freely repeatable (ability-general) <br>
capacity or competence supplemented contextually by an exercise of a referential capacity <br><br>

<b>FOOTNOTES</b><br>
<b>Cont FN</b>32 Sometimes the circumstance, state of affairs, or “condition” of the world that makes representational con-<br>
tents veridical or non-veridical is called a ‘veridicality condition’, or a ‘truth condition’ or an ‘accuracy condition’. <br>
Obviously, this usage differs from mine. The different notions of veridicality condition that I discuss in the text <br>
have to do with how finely differentiated types of representation are taken to be. I do not use the terms ‘ver idi cal-<br>
ity condition’, ‘truth condition’, or ‘accuracy condition’ in the condition-in-the-world way. I use them to apply to <br>
the condition set by a representation, representational content, or representational state, that is made veridical <br>
(or not) by a condition in the world.<br>
33 The redundant phrase ‘non-repeatable particular’ is meant to make the meaning of ‘<i>particular</i>’ vivid. I use <br>
the term ‘particular’ rather than the more commonly used term ‘object’, because objects are easily thought of as <br>
confined to physical objects, or to bodies and surfaces. Perceivable particulars include physical objects, bodies, <br>
and surfaces. They also include many other things—for example, instances of color and shape (tropes).</div>
