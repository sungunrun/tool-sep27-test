tem poral order without being able to determine a linear temporal metric. The intervals <br>
may not be comparable, in the psychology, to other intervals that are timed.<br>
<br>
It is likely that such timing mechanisms are applicable only for very short (sub-300 ms) <br>
phenomena.267 The interesting point, for our purposes, is that there may be timing mech-<br>
an isms that do not fit into a comprehensive temporal framework. They would not allow <br>
systematic coordination of timings, on a single metric scale, across contexts, across <br>
modalities—much less with higher-level, conceptual representation. Yet they record <br>
 tem poral order.<br>
<br>
I mention such mechanisms as a reminder that a full account must distinguish signifi-<br>
cantly different types of timings. Some represent various timings as being on a single scale. <br>
Others may be non-linear and may serve temporal discriminations and comparisons only <br>
within a given context.<br>
<br>
I have highlighted variety in temporal representation. There are different timing mech-<br>
an isms for different temporal scales. Different events, starting at different times, can be <br>
perceived and timed within a given perception. Different areas in the visual field are timed <br>
independently and sometimes at different rates. There are different ways in which different <br>
types of timing are distorted.268 Given the number of independently moving parts in the <br>
timing mechanisms of perception, one can well wonder how an organism makes any <br>
 unified sense of time.<br>
<br>
There seem to be feedback mechanisms that re-calibrate timing, at least at larger <br>
scales—500 ms and above. Such mechanisms are prominent in timing motion. If a timer is <br>
sufficiently out of sync with laws of motion that have been stamped into an organism’s <br>
psychology, a perception is corrected. Such correction mechanisms may be modality-<br>
specific, inter-modal, or amodal.<br>
<br>
There appear to be separate mechanisms for timing biological motion269 and Newtonian <br>
motion.270 <i>Biological motion</i> depends on endogenous forces as well as exogenous and <br>
inertial forces. <i>Newtonian motion</i> is that of non-living bodies. Once a motion is perceived <br>
as having signatures of one or other type of motion, the appropriate correcting timing <br>
mech an isms kick in.<br>
<br>
Both linear and non-linear timers in perceptual representation require a starting <br>
point—a represented present, against which duration of events and intervals is timed. As <br>
with spatial representation, various kinds of anchors or origins are set for different <br><br>
