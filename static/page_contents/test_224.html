properties. Differences in speed of formation, speed in causing action responses, reliability <br>
in being accurate are examples of such properties. So different modes of presentation, dif-<br>
ferent attributives, for a given attribute (a given property or relation) differ in psy cho logic-<br>
al ly measurable ways.<br>
<br>
Let us elaborate on such psychological differences. Perceptual attributives are psycho-<br>
logical capacities that function to characterize perceived particulars. When the capacities <br>
are exercised, they are sub-units within complex, concrete psychological state instances <br>
that pick out multitudes of particulars and characterize them as having many attributes. In <br>
a given psychology, in a given perceptual system, each attribute is commonly represented <br>
and attributed in a different way in each different perceptual state that represents and <br>
attributes that attribute. The variety of specific perceptual capacities for attributing any <br>
given attribute is huge. For each psychologically different cue combination triggers a <br>
capacity to respond to that cue combination to produce a psychologically distinctive way <br>
of attributing the attribute. Exercises, in different states, of different attributives for a given <br>
attribute are embedded in different law-like patterns—different probabilities for accuracy, <br>
different causal relations with other psychological states. Such differences are marked by <br>
differences in attributive representational content in perceiving constant attributes. <br>
Psychological laws operate partly on perceptual representational contents. The most basic, <br>
one-place, non-relational perceptual attributives for the constant attributes—for example, <br>
in Figure 7.1 attributives for a non-relational property, such as specific edge length—vary <br>
with different stimulus conditions. A similar point applies to shape representation, on <br>
which constancies for edges, surfaces, and bodies are based. Moreover, in other situations, <br>
a constant relation can be represented in different ways. The different ways exhibit differ-<br>
ences in speed, accuracy, and causal relations to other psychological states.<br>
<br>
Perceptual representational content with 3-D significance has the format of a plotting <br>
or mapping of spatial relations in the environment in something like the way a realist <br>
drawing of a 3-D scene does. The plotting is anchored egocentrically on the viewer and <br>
operates with some approximation to linear perspective. (This latter assumption is not <br>
essential, just illustrative.) Given that relations between a perceiver and the spatial en vir-<br>
on ment change, this format necessitates systematic, fine-grained differences in ways in <br>
which any given non-relational spatial attribute can be perceptually represented. The dif-<br>
ferences affect the basic content of natural perceptual spatial representation. I will, later in <br>
this section, further elaborate the idea that the very same points that apply to basic repre-<br>
sentations of any given <i>non-relational representatum</i> also apply to basic representations of <br>
any given <i>relational representatum.<br>
<br>
</i>Here is a second illustration of this point about differences in modes of presentation, <br>
beyond the one in Figure 7.1. This second illustration does not depend on the comparison <br>
of vision to drawing. It, too, focuses initially on non-relational spatial properties, for the <br>
sake of intuitive clarity. Its point, too, will be extended to perceptual representation of <br>
spatial relations.<br>
<br>
Imagine that the spatial coordinate system were calibrated in numerical units, say, <br>
centi meters. Insofar as the visual system has enough cues to specify a particular’s distance <br>
(as distinct from ordinal depth), the distance from the egocentric anchor point would be <br>
specified.<br>
<br>
Suppose that the straight left edge of a flat, rectangular surface is oriented vertically in <br>
the fronto-parallel plane. Suppose that the mid-point of the edge is straight ahead. In </div>
