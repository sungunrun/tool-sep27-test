<br><br>
long as my conscious experience remains a sea of faces, there is an ordinary sense in <br>
<br>
which I do not know what you mean. The problem here does not have to do with <br>
<br>
whether I am reliable. We can suppose that I am quite reliable in my guesses and we <br>
<br>
establish this over a series of such cases. The point is rather that I do not know who you <br>
<br>
mean until I finally look a where my finger is  pointing or look to see who is wearing the <br>
<br>
clothes I described in my guesses. It is only when I . . . single out the woman in my <br>
<br>
 experience of the room, when it ceases to be a sea of faces, and in my experience I focus <br>
<br>
on the person, that I would ordinarily be said to know who was being referred to. So it <br>
<br>
does seem to be compelling to common sense that conscious attention to the object is <br>
<br>
needed for an understanding of the demonstrative.479<br><br>
This argument fails in two ways.480 One lies in Campbell’s characterization of the super-<br>
blindseer as guessing. The idealization of super-blindsight supposes that blindseers engage <br>
in confident, reliably veridical perception and judgment with full information and with <br>
full confidence. Actual (non-super-)blindseers initially <i>regard</i> themselves as guessing. <br>
However, both blindseers and super-blindseers have a reliable competence. We know the <br>
general mechanism for the competence. Light causes the visual system to enter a series of <br>
states that provide fairly reliable information registered from environmental objects and <br>
attributes. Real blindseers either lack visual consciousness, or have so little that they do not <br>
take it to aid them in vision. Yet they take in useful visual information that they can act <br>
successfully on. Suppose that a <i>super-blindseer</i> has a fully reliable <i>perceptual</i> competence, <br>
but lacks any phenomenal consciousness. It is not plausible to say that a super-blindseer <br>
would be just guessing.<br>
<br>
Campbell anticipates and tries to block this criticism. He insists that ‘fast, accurate, and <br>
reliable’ super-blindseeing “is still said to be ‘only guessing’ ”.481 Where is it said, outside <br>
Campbell’s theory-based insistence, that a super-blindseer would be guessing? Here the <br>
argument cannot draw on a shared background of common sense. Dictionaries and or din-<br>
ary speech count guessing as taking something to be correct without having enough infor-<br>
mation to be rightly confident about it. Super-blindseers are not guessing, by this standard. <br>
It is not common sense, or ordinary linguistic usage, to say that a competent, reliable, con-<br>
fident super-blindseer would be guessing. Such a claim lacks any dialectical or argumenta-<br>
tive force. No attributions of guessing to the super-blindseer are plausible enough to <br>
provide even a prima facie reason against the view that a super-blindseer’s perceptions <br>
pick out objects and attribute properties to them, and that a super-blindseer can base <i>de re</i>, <br><br>

<b>FOOTNOTES</b><br>
<b>Cont FN</b>479 Campbell, <i>Reference and Consciousness</i>, 7–9. Campbell introduces this passage in a misleading way. He <br>
writes, ‘The issue is whether the blindseer has the very same way of interpreting the demonstrative as the or din-<br>
ary subject has. That is, the question is whether for the ordinary subject consciousness of the object is not com-<br>
pletely idle in an understanding of the demonstrative’ (8). These formulations are not equivalent to one another. <br>
Neither formulation is equivalent to the issue that the argument addresses—whether consciousness is constitu-<br>
tively necessary to having demonstrative thought. Anyone should agree that an unconscious “interpretation” (or <br>
mode of presentation) differs from a conscious one. The issue is also not whether consciousness is ‘completely <br>
idle’ in understanding the demonstrative for the conscious subject. The issue is whether it is constitutively neces-<br>
sary for any demonstrative, <i>de re</i> thought. This conflation of being constitutive to <i>de re</i> reference with being idle <br>
in normal, conscious <i>de re</i> reference is common in Campbell’s work and that of his followers. It is empirically <br>
obvious that, in actual fact, consciousness sharpens, enriches, and makes useful perceptual information. <br>
D. Smithies, ‘What is the Role of Consciousness in Demonstrative Thought?’, <i>The Journal of Philosophy</i> 108 <br>
(2011), 5–34, especially 31ff., endorses Campbell’s sea-of-faces argument, and takes Treisman’s work to be foun-<br>
dational for his own.<br>
