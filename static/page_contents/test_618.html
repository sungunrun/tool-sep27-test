618 Perceptual Long-Term Memory</div>

natural scenes, rather than in artificial, laboratory arrays. Testing memory in natural-scene <br>
conditions has been common for longer with long-term memory than it has been for <br>
working memory.<br>
<br>
The effect of ability-general long-term memory on <i>de re</i> forms of long-term memory is <br>
displayed in expertise. When experts’ memories come from attending to differences <br>
among particulars, their recognition is faster, more specific. Their memory of complex <br>
structure is better. Individuals with more perceptual experience with dogs or vegetables <br>
perceptually recognize more quickly an instance at a more specific categorization-level <br>
(<i>beagle-body</i>, <i>carrot-body</i>) than at a more general categorization-level (<i>dog-body</i>,  <i>vege table-<br>
body</i>). Conceptual recognition and memory are also better. Baseball fans remember base-<br>
ball statistics. Wine connoisseurs remember wine labels. Expertise yields detailed <br>
schematic memories and associations. These improve recognition and encoding in work-<br>
ing memory, episodic memory, and ability-general long-term memory—at both concep-<br>
tual and perceptual levels.965<br>
<br>
The superiority of recognition and memory for natural-scene subject matters over mem-<br>
ory for artificial arrays derives from the same psychological patterns that produce the <br>
 superiority of memory and recognition by experts. Through evolution and learning, we are <br>
all experts in natural scene statistics. Storage of natural-scene patterns enables individuals <br>
to anticipate what sorts of objects occur in given types of scenes (forest, bush, kitchen), the <br>
likely positions and orientations of those objects, their sizes, shapes, colors, and so on. More <br>
features are remembered when objects are shown in a natural scene than when displayed <br>
alone. Ability-general memory of likely relations among objects and attributes makes an <br>
analog of chunking possible. If statistical co-occurrence among attributives is high, mem-<br>
ory groups co-occurring attributes—packing more information into remembered “units”.966<br>
<br>
The analog of chunking here lies in use of ensemble statistics, not just in feature-<br>
packaging. Given our expertise in natural scene statistics, we can recognize faster and <br>
remember more about arrangements of perceived entities in natural scenes than we can in <br>
artificial displays.<br>
<br>
A corollary is that anomalous aspects of natural scenes are well remembered. Perception <br>
of a porcupine in a kitchen would be well stored. By breaking with statistical regularities <br>
held in memory, anomalous items draw attention, which in turn encourages memory.967<br><br>
