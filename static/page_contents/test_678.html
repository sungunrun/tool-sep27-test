sense rational, in light of the content of the cognitive state’.1104 She uses ‘cognitive systems’ <br>
with no explication of what is meant. The examples she considers, however, bear on pene-<br>
tra tion by beliefs—clearly cognitive states. So lack of explication of ‘cognitive systems’ does <br>
not affect the cases that she discusses.<br>
<br>
MacPherson argues for cognitive penetration of visual experience from an experiment <br>
on color perception.1105 Experimenters cut out shapes of familiar objects from a sheet of <br>
paper with a uniform orange color. Some of the shapes were shapes of paradigmatically <br>
red objects: a heart shape, an apple shape, the shape of a pair of lips. Some were not: an <br>
oval, a circle, a mushroom-shape, a horse-head-shape, a bell-shape. The orange-colored <br>
cut-out shapes were placed in front of a background whose color could be changed from <br>
yellow through shades of orange to shades of red by turning a knob. Subjects were asked to <br>
tell the experimenter to change the background color so that the cutout shape’s color was <br>
indistinguishable from the background. When the cutout shape was the shape of an object <br>
that was commonly red and that shape was placed in front of the background, the subjects <br>
chose a background color that was more red than the color that they chose when the cut-<br>
out shape was the shape of an object that was not usually red.1106<br>
<br>
MacPherson writes, ‘the subjects’ beliefs, that certain cutout shapes are shapes of objects <br>
that are characteristically red penetrated their perceptual experience of those cutout shapes, <br>
thereby altering the content and phenomenal character of those experiences’ (39). She <br>
sketches a two-step causal process that she calls ‘indirect’. A belief that objects of a given <br>
shape tend to be red is taken to cause an imagination-type state that represents as of a red <br>
object of the given shape. This imagination-type state then biases perceptual states as of <br>
objects of that shape toward attributions of red, even when the shape before them is orange.<br>
<br>
Anecdotally, we all know of cases in which thinking of something causes imagining as <br>
of that something. There is empirical evidence that imagining interacts with perceiving. <br><br>

<b>FN</b>1104 F. MacPherson, ‘Cognitive Penetration of Colour Experience: Rethinking the Issue in Light of an Indirect <br>
Mechanism’, <i>Philosophy and Phenomenological Research</i> 84 (2012), 24–62, 28. MacPherson picks up on Pylyshyn’s <br>
metaphorical restrictions on penetration—requiring “making semantic sense” and “rationality”. A similar specifi-<br>
cation of cognitive penetration is provided by Siegel, ‘Cognitive Penetrability and Perceptual Justification’. Like <br>
MacPherson, Siegal couches her discussion in terms of penetration of perceptual experience, not penetration of <br>
processing in a perceptual system. Her discussion makes little use of science and does not cite Pylyshyn, ‘Is Vision <br>
Continuous with Cognition? The Case for Cognitive Impenetrability of Visual Perception’. It should be said that, <br>
the discussions by both MacPherson and Siegel are, strictly speaking, hypothetical. Siegel’s main focus is on epis-<br>
temology, not psychological kinds. I think that since epistemology concerns norms for good use of psychological <br>
resources, paradigmatically insofar as such use bears on gaining knowledge, it should be firmly grounded in what <br>
is known about psychological resources—hence grounded in psychological kinds.<br>

<b>FN</b>1106 MacPherson cites two other experiments to bolster her interpretation of the experiment: Hansen, <br>

‘Distortions in the Perceived Lightness of Faces: The Role of Race Categories’, <i>Journal of Experimental Psychology: <br>
General</i> 135 (2006), 501–512. In both cases, the point developed in the text below applies. The point is that the <br>
source of perceptual distortion has not been shown not to be low-level non-cognitive associations. The authors <br>
of the first of these two experiments do not specifically argue for cognitive penetration. The authors of the latter <br>
article advertise cognitive penetration by race categories in their title, but never even argue for those categories’ <br>
being the causal source. Their actual explanation at the end of their article appeals to sub-cognitive associations <br>
between color and spatial form. Although this second article is widely cited as supporting cognitive penetration, <br>
it is beset with an exceptional number of theoretical and methodological problems. For good critical discussion, <br>
