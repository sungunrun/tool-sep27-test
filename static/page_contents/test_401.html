Philosophical Views Influenced by Treisman’s Theory 401</div>

Potter proposed that the attentional blink occurred not because of lack of attention to <br>
the second picture. It occurred because short-term memory of the already-fully-<br>
categorized second picture could not consolidate until memory of the first picture was <br>
consolidated. She maintained that what occurs serially is not perceptual representation <br>
of bound features of a single object, but memory of already-bound object representa-<br>
tions. Evans and Treisman’s model predicted that categorizations of perceived objects <br>
(as opposed to dissociated features) can occur only serially, one at a time. Potter showed <br>
this prediction to be mistaken. She showed that if two pictures are presented in sequence <br>
<i>faster</i> than 150 ms, they both can be categorized and remembered. At 107 ms after <br>
 stimulus onset, subjects can accurately categorize and remember objects involving <br>
bound features.475 So, more than one picture can be categorized in rapid sequential pres-<br>
entation. Potter hypothesized that representation of a bound, categorized object draws <br>
attention to it and its position—rather than depending on application of attention to a <br>
position. When a second picture is presented within 150 ms of the first (“Lag 1”), it is <br>
perceived and cat egor ized with bound features. The burst of attention drawn to the first <br>
categorization carries over to a second, as long as both occur within Lag 1. Attention <br>
facilitates memory of both items. Outside Lag 1, and within the 150–500 ms window, <br>
attention can facilitate memory only serially.<br>
<br>
The key point is that multiple objects can be categorized in brief, sequential exposures. <br>
When a word or picture primes a basic-level or superordinate category before presenta-<br>
tion of a sequence of pictures, categorization of a picture can occur with even briefer pres-<br>
entation times.476<br><br>

<b>Philosophical Views Influenced by Treisman’s Binding Theory<br><br>
</div>
</b>Philosophical views have been influenced by Treisman’s Feature-Integration Theory. John <br>
Campbell relied on Treisman’s work to support the claim that demonstrative reference to <br>
objects <i>in thought</i> depends on applications of attention in both perception and thought. <br>
Demonstrative reference to objects in thought was supposed to depend essentially on <br>
binding in perception, and binding in perception was supposed to depend on applications <br>
of attention.477<br>
<br>
Campbell holds the peculiar view, incompatible with science, that there is no represen-<br>
tation in perception—only direct relations to objects. He maintains that demonstrative <br>
reference in <i>thought</i> depends on attention in perception. He does not claim that reference <br>
in <i>perception</i> depends on attention, because he thinks that there is no representation, <br>
hence no reference, in perception. Attention plays two roles on his view. One is the binding <br><br>

that categorization of the first picture drew transient attention to a position. If the second picture occurred at that <br>
position, memory was facilitated. Strikingly, correct categorization and memory of the picture were well above <br>
chance even if it occurred in a second position.<br>
