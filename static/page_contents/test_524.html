motor command. Such input allows the motor command controller to issue new com-<br>
mands that correct the initial movement—for example, if the target moves after the initial <br>
motor command and after the bodily movement is begun. The primary representational <br>
state that results from integration of anticipation and perception (see the ‘Comparator’ <br>
box) is a visual representation, perhaps a visual perceptual memory, not a belief.<br>
<br>
According to many models, the computations carried out in these motor processes, as <br>
in perception, follow Bayesian principles.718 Assessment of the state of the world in form-<br>
ing the perceptual memory about the states of the body and the target after the initial <br>
motor command (often called ‘estimation’) is based on probabilities that take account of <br>
the prior probability of those states’ accuracy and the registrations that yield the percep-<br>
tions and anticipations. Bayesian principles govern formation of perceptual states, percep-<br>
tual memories, and perceptual anticipations.<br>
<br>
Let <i>p</i>(<i>hpa</i>) be a perceptual anticipation formed from efference copy. Let <i>p</i>(<i>hpm</i>) be the <br>
degree of confidence in a short-term perceptual memory about the states of the body and <br>
target after a motor command. <i>hpm</i> is the result of a combinations of sensory feedback and <br>
sensory anticipations.<br>
<br>
The relevant states cited in the model, again, do not involve propositional capacities. <br>
Bayes’s rule can be applied to any representation that has veridicality conditions. Inasmuch <br>
as perceptions, perceptual anticipations, and perceptual memories are in iconic, noun-<br>
phrase-like form, the rule and computations based on it apply just as well to them as they <br>
do to propositional representations. <i>hpm</i> is a perceptual memory in iconic, noun-phrase-<br>
like form. Similarly, for <i>hpa.<br>
<br>
p</i>(<i>hpa</i>) and <i>p</i>(<i>hpm</i>)—and the relevant perceptions themselves—are formed and updated <br>
in accord with Bayesian principles. For example, perceptual anticipation is representable <br>
as a conditional probability <i>p</i>(<i>hpa</i>|<i>hp</i>*, <i>mc</i>), where <i>hp</i>* is a perceptual representation of the <br>
current state of things (say, the current state of the body-part effector) and <i>mc</i> is an effer-<br>
ent copy of the motor command.<br>
<br>
Perceptual anticipation of the state of a body-part effector must be updated, because of <br>
noise that diverts actual motor movement from the movement represented in a motor <br>
command and because of uncertainty in the sensory feedback itself. Bayesian formation of <br>
the perceptual anticipation makes use of the <i>prior likelihood</i>, <i>p</i>(<i>hp</i>*<b>*|</b><i>hpa</i>)—the degree of <br>
confidence in the new sensory feedback, <i>hp</i>*<b>*</b>, given the veridicality of the perceptual <br>
anticipation, <i>hpa</i>. It also uses the prior confidence in the anticipation itself <i>p</i>(<i>hpa</i>) and the <br>
prior confidence in the sensory feedback (which I assume here to be 1). Then Bayes’s rule <br>
is that the new perceptual anticipation is the <i>posterior probability</i> <i>p</i>(<i>hpa</i>|<i>hp</i>**, <i>mc</i>). It is equal <br>
to <i>p</i>(<i>hp</i>*<b>*|</b><i>hpa</i>)<i>p</i>(<i>hpa</i>)).<br>
<br>
Bayesian decision theory often models motor control commands. The models take per-<br>
ceptions, perceptual memories, and perceptual anticipations as input and yield motor <br>
commands and motor movements as outputs. The commands depend on updateable <br>
cost–benefit settings. Speed and accuracy are usually benefits; expenditure of energy and <br><br>
