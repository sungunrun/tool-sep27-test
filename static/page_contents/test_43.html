automatic, framework-induced “indexical” reference to a place or time. The place is usu-<br>
ally on the perceiver’s body—perhaps between the two eyes. Usually, the time is a psy cho-<br>
logic al present.<br>
<br>
I sometimes call applications of these indexical schematic competencies ‘indexical <br>
applications’. I take them to be a species of <i>referential</i> application. Although they are not <br>
applications that ever count as perceptions (such as seeings), they occur in perceptual sys-<br>
tems. In fact, they occur in nearly all perceptual states. So I count them as <i>perceptual</i> refer-<br>
ential applications, although they do not effect perceptual reference—perceiving a <br>
particular—in the strict sense. I discuss perceptual schematic contents and their applica-<br>
tions in greater detail in Chapter 8.<br>
<br>
I believe that it is apriori that every perceptual state exercises a repeatable competence <br>
to pick out particulars in context-dependent ways—particulars that figure in occurrently <br>
causing the state. Hence it is apriori that it involves schematic constituents. Always, some <br>
of these depend on causation to represent particulars. Usually some operate as indexical <br>
anchors for spatial or temporal frameworks, not depending on causal relations to particu-<br>
lars for having referents. It is not apriori that these latter anchor-like competencies are <br>
instantiated in every perceptual state, although I think it apriori that every perceptual sys-<br>
tem has a capacity for temporal anchoring. (See Chapter 8.) It is apriori that competencies <br>
to perceptually pick out particulars are exercised in every perceptual state. So it is also <br>
apriori that all perceptual states involve occurrent events or instantiated aspects that func-<br>
tion to pick out particulars. Hence it is apriori that all perceptual states involve referential <br>
applications—those that function perceptually to pick out particulars.<br>
<br>
I turn now to a third representational constituent in perception. There are only three. <br>
So far, I have distinguished two—referential applications and schematic contents. Earlier, I <br>
said that the representational function of perception is to be accurate. Being perceptually <br>
accurate consists in perceptually picking out (perceiving) particulars and perceptually <br>
characterizing them.38<br>
<br>
The third element constitutes the characterizing or relating competence.<br>
<br>
Schematic constituents are <i>ability­ general</i>, in the sense that they are standing abilities or <br>
competencies, not to be explained or individuated in terms of any particular event. <br>
Usually, they are abilities or competencies to refer to or pick out a particular. That is, usu-<br>
ally when the competence is successfully realized, through being exercised, it has one <i>rep­<br>
resentatum</i>. (As I indicated, I take singular referential applications to be primary in <br>
perception.) In this sense the schematic constituent is <i>semantically singular</i>. Since the <br>
competence and the function to pick out one particular are coded in its representational <br>
form, it is <i>formally singular</i>.39<br>
<br>
The third constituent in perceptual content is like the schematic constituent in being <br>
ability-general. It differs from the schematic element in being semantically and formally <br>
general. Mainly it differs in its representational function—to characterize or relate.<br><br>

ties. Most perception also involves attribution of relations.<br>

39 These distinctions are laid out in Burge, ‘Five Theses on <i>De Re</i> States and Attitudes’, in the section <br>
‘Attribution and Four Sorts of Generality’. Here what I call ‘formal singularity’ I called ‘syntactic singularity’ <br>
there. Earlier expositions of the distinctions occur in T. Burge, ‘Descartes and Anti-Individualism’ (2006), in <br>
