volume shape representation, much less categorization of bodies. The 1990s saw the <br>
 discovery that 3-D volume shape representation, simple categorizations of faces, body-<br>
parts, and bodies by specific shapes, and spatial relations among these entities, were pro-<br>
duced at very high speeds, in less than a tenth of a second. No input from memory, <br>
attention, or action sets was found to be necessary. There was no reasonable way to deny <br>
that these such representation is part of the purely visual-perceptual formation process that <br>
produces representations of color, textures, surfaces, motion. Even by the most traditional <br>
conceptions of visual processing, visual representation came to include representation of <br>
faces, bodies, 3-D volume shapes and 3-D relations.<br>
<br>
Given the speed and automatic character of further processing in the next 200–250 ms, <br>
after the dominantly feed-forward sweep, it was natural to study supplements to this <br>
sweep as also part of purely visual-perceptual processing. Some of these supplements—<br>
those of scene gist (Chapter 10, the section Two Types of First-Formed <br>
Perception), for example—are perceptual representations that combine with other <br>
concurrent perceptual representations. Some are retentions from previous perceptions—<br>
memory templates, for example (Chapter 17.) Some are inputs from attention, often <br>
deriving from task-relevant sets in the actional system (Chapters 14 and 15). Such sup-<br>
plements are integral parts of visual processing. They show no signatures of a different <br>
sort of processing. Their inputs are representations in having perceptual form and con-<br>
tent. Although some are feedback from states formed earlier than those directly trig-<br>
gered by perception, the lesson from the first-mentioned change in the science is that <br>
directionality of processing does not determine whether processing is perceptual (or <br>
perceptual-level).<br>
<br>
The effect of this second change in the science, again, is recognition that visual process-<br>
ing is more far-reaching, and that the visual system is richer, than it had been thought to <br>
be. It generates representations of particulars as having some of the attributes that com-<br>
mon sense takes to be perceptually ascribed. It attributes 3-D volume shape and <i>body</i>. <br>
Attributives like cause and agent and functional attributives like predator, food, and tool <br>
will probably turn out to be produced by the visual system, with no help from supra-<br>
perceptual-level capacities.<br>
<br>
These two changes have not been well-assimilated in philosophical discussion of visual <br>
perception. Most of the discussion of “impenetrability” centers on the first change, widely <br>
misinterpreting it. Most philosophical discussion ignores the second.<br>
<br>
One ground for neglect of the second change is that the first advocates of impenetrabil-<br>
ity, Fodor and Pylyshyn, seem to have been unaware or insufficiently aware of it. Of course, <br>
Fodor’s first contribution to the discussion, in 1983, predated the change. But Pylyshyn’s <br>
main contribution, in 1998, post-dated the breakthroughs by Thorpe and Van Rullen. <br>
Pylyshyn took the outer reach of the visual system to be 3-D volume shape representation, <br>
slightly wider than Marr’s 2½-D sketch, but excluding categorization. In any case, both <br>
supporters and opponents of Pylyshyn’s proposals took on his conception of the visual <br>
module as relatively small.<br>
<br>
Even the widely known first main change was misinterpreted. Directionality of processing <br>
was often taken to be a signature of the nature of what is processed. Feed-forward process-<br>
ing was supposed to be perceptual. Feed-back processing, cognitive. These simplistic ideas <br>
ignored cautions that Pylyshyn issued. He cited feedback within visual processing. He just <br>
thought visual processing was confined to a smaller box than it in fact is.</div>
