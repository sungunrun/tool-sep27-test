agreed upon test for full absence of attention. With many perceptual psychologists, I write <br>
of the <i>near absence of attention</i>, to hedge this issue. Conscious perception of specific <br>
en tities does occur in the near absence of attention to those entities. That is, it can occur <br>
with as little attention as current experimentation has been able to produce.393 I do not <br>
focus primarily on consciousness. I focus on what is perceived, not what is consciously <br>
perceived.<br>
<br>
I now discuss six further points that frame what follows.<br><br>

(2012), 1–7, argue that attention is necessary for consciousness, but deny that consciousness is necessary for <br>
attention. Cohen, Alvarez, and Nakayama ‘Natural-Scene Perception Requires Attention’, used relatively small <br>
stimuli, presenting objects at less than 20-degree visual angle on a computer screen. The experiments did not test <br>
the full range of vision in a natural scene. Subsequent work showed that even in the far periphery, with no evi-<br>
dent application of attention, attributions of objects with properties, occurs. Although attention is probably <br>
always present somewhere in a percept, even in first-formed perception of briefly exposed scenes, there is no <br>
good reason to think it <i>necessary</i> to binding. There is substantial evidence that it is not necessary. See Kihara and <br>
Takeda, ‘Attention-Free Integration of Spatial Frequency Information in Natural Scenes’; M. Boucarta, <br>

<i>Vision Research</i> 86 (2013), 35–42. See also K. Kihara, H. Kondo, and J. Kawahara, ‘Differential Contributions of <br>
GABA Concentration in Frontal and Parietal Regions to Individual Differences in Attentional Blink’, <i>The Journal <br>
of Neuroscience</i> 36 (2016), 8895–8901. I discuss more evidence later in this chapter.<br>
Cohen, Cavanagh, Chun, and Nakayama, ‘The Attentional Requirements of Consciousness’, state incorrectly <br>
that the articles by J. van Boxtel <i>et al.</i> and the first article by Block just cited claim “proof” for consciousness <br>
without attention. In fact, these latter authors all note the methodological difficulties of settling the issue and <br>
propose their views as the most plausible accounts, given the evidence.<br>
Cohen, Cavanagh, Chun, and Nakayama, ‘The Attentional Requirements of Consciousness’, maintain that all <br>
supposed cases of consciousness without attention are undermined by a fuller set of requirements. There are <br>
several deficiencies in this proposal. I mention two. First, the authors hold that if there is consciousness without <br>
attention in cases where, at a given time, attention is distracted from the target task by other tasks, there must be <br>
consciousness without attention in entirely different cases, such as cases of masking interference. These other <br>
cases involve different conditions. I think that this claim has no merit at all. All the other cited cases involve dif-<br>
ferent perceptual exposures over time, and call upon memory in different ways from the multiple-task paradigm. <br>
I know of no reason to think that if one can get consciousness without attention in the multiple-task cases, one <br>
should get consciousness without attention in the other cases. The relation between consciousness and attention <br>
depends on the psychological capacities employed. Cohen, Alvarez, and Nakayama ‘Natural-Scene Perception <br>
Requires Attention’, claim that consciousness always requires attention. The fact that in some experimental para-<br>
digms, consciousness requires attention, does not even begin show that all consciousness requires attention <br>
regardless of what psychological capacities are employed, or under what conditions they are employed. Second, <br>
the authors proposal begs the question, by <i>assuming</i>—without any discussion—that in cases of change-detection <br>
tests and attentional-blink tests, individuals do not consciously see the items that change or are substituted for <br>
<i>before</i> the change or substitution. A similar question-begging assumption guides R. Marois, D.-J. Yi, and M. Chun, <br>
‘The Neural Fate of Consciously Perceived and Missed Events in the Attentional Blink’, <i>Neuron</i> 41 (2004), <br>
465–472. As I shall explain, the cases cited as evidence that consciousness in perception requires attention hinge <br>
more on failures of conscious memory, memory-comparison, and memory-retrieval, than on failures of percep-<br>
tion. The fact that one cannot consciously remember something after changes and interferences have been intro-<br>
duced simply does not <i>in itself</i> show anything about what was, or was not, consciously perceived before the <br>
changes or interferences.<br>
So I think that these defenses of the view that consciousness requires attention have no merit. For a brief, <br>
cogent reply to Cohen, Alvarez, and Nakayama ‘Natural-Scene Perception Requires Attention’, see N. Tsuchiya, <br>
N. Block, and C. Koch, ‘Top-Down Attention and Consciousness: Comments to Cohen <i>et al.</i>’, <i>Trends in Cognitive <br>
Science</i> 16 (2012), 527. I have benefitted here from discussion with Ned Block.</div>
