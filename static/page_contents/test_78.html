78 perceptual constancy</div>
<br><br>
In cases in which registration of proximal stimulation is not blocked, explanation of the <br>
formation—as distinguished from the function—of the state is, in many cases, carried out <br>
entirely in terms of the registration’s response to proximal stimulation. In the causal <br>
explanatory story, as distinct from the functional story, there is no need to postulate a state <br>
that represents the distal environment. The account centers on registration of the proximal <br>
stimulus. So the efference copy does not in itself yield perceptual constancies. No en vir on-<br>
men tal feature is taken to be a constant <i>representatum</i> through significant variations in <br>
proximal stimulation.<br>
<br>
A lesson from these cases is to distinguish <i>objective functional relevance</i> of mechanisms <br>
operating in a sensory system from <i>objectification</i> present in perceptual constancies.72 <br>
Nearly all sensory states <i>function</i> to improve connection to survival-relevant aspects of the <br>
environment. Perceptual constancies mark a distinction in kinds of sensory states. These <br>
kinds are fixed by <i>causal</i> laws governing their formation. Kind-fixation is reflected in <br>
causal explanations—not functional explanations. To understand perceptual constancies, <br>
one must look at the science’s account of sensory-state-formation, not merely its account <br>
of the states’ biological function. In cases discussed so far, formation of sensory states <br>
involves no deep distinction between registration of proximal stimulation—which is <br>
clearly not perceptual—and some further kind of sensory state that is identified, in causal <br>
explanation, as representing some environmental feature.<br><br>

<b>Path Integration: Another Non-Perceptual Invariance<br><br>
</div>
</b>Some systems that contribute to navigation function to track scalar spatial attributes. It is <br>
worth comparing such systems to perceptual constancies.<br>
<br>
Path integration is a computation that yields an informational vector, constituted by a <br>
distance and a direction, from information that correlates with speed, direction, and time. <br>
There are certainly path integration systems that operate on perceptual states regarding <br>
distance and/or direction. Such systems are representational and make use of perceptual <br>
constancies. Let us consider path integration systems whose sensory inputs are not <br>
perceptual.73<br>
<br>
Suppose that, in an ant, distance information derives from summing energy expended <br>
in stepping movement of the legs. Suppose that directional information derives from sum-<br>
ming information from the torque in the leg joints. Or suppose that a bee’s visual system’s <br>
summing of registration of retinal flow—given constant flying speed—functions to cor rel-<br>
ate with distance; its summing of air pressure in flight on its different sides—functions to <br>
correlate with direction.74<br>
<br>
Different combinations of input functionally correlating with distance and direction <br>
can yield the same vector. One might analogize the proprioceptive computation to a per-<br>
ceptual constancy. Significantly different proximal inputs yield states that correlate with a <br><br>
