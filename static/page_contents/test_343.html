represented in a perception. Sometimes there are indeterminacies of length, orientation, <br>
and position. If a sub-part is seen, it is situated differently in the spatial representational <br>
framework, from other seen sub-parts. It produces a different causal chain triggering an <br>
aspect of the perception. I see no basis for denying that the sub-part is perceptually dis-<br>
criminated from other sub-parts. A referential application picks out that part in the sense <br>
previously indicated. Unquestionably, one sees sub-parts of a natural perceptual unit that <br>
are not themselves natural units. Associating perceptual representation too closely with <br>
attention and segmentation is a natural mistake if one assimilates semantics of perception <br>
to semantics of language.<br>
<br>
The other specific source of doubt derives from reflecting on visual search. Perceivers <br>
are asked to say whether a dot is on a line, among a tangle of lines fully in view. Perceivers <br>
take time to answer. Tracing the line from a highlighted segment to the dot may be needed. <br>
The doubt comes from thinking that the dot’s being on the line is not perceived until the <br>
search is completed. It might be thought that most parts of a line segment from starting <br>
point to dot are not perceived.<br>
<br>
Some of the seeming power of this doubt, like the previous one, derives from conflating <br>
perceiving with attending or noticing. Given that the tangle is fully in view, tracing a line <br>
is, I think, bringing to attention and full awareness a condition that is already perceptually <br>
represented. There is much more in any perceptual representation than one can, on any <br>
given occasion, notice or report.369 Working memory drops out much of what we perceive, <br>
right after we perceive it. Although some of what drops out is retained in long-term mem-<br>
ory, even what is retained is often not easily accessible to report. (See Chapters 16 and 17.) <br>
Visual search may be necessary to encode the dot’s position in conscious working memory. <br>
At least in unrushed non-peripheral vision, a tangle of lines can be represented and veridi-<br>
cally parsed. (See Chapter 10.)370<br>
<br>
The ideas about automatic perceptual representation of sub-parts when one per cep-<br>
tual ly represents wholes can, I think, be used in understanding perception of color <br>
expanses, including those that are not colors of surfaces—colors in rainbows or colors of <br>
gases or clouds, or the sky.<br>
<br>
I turn to one further aspect of part–whole representation—perceptual representation of <br>
unperceived parts and their attributes. In perceptually tracking a disc as it passes behind an <br>
occlusion, there are moments at which the disc is seen only by seeing its still-unoccluded <br>
parts. (See note 92.) The disc surface is perceptually represented as a whole surface even <br>
when it is partly occluded. The instance of the whole shape is perceived and the whole <br>
shape is perceptually attributed. These representations occur via perceptual representation <br><br>

<b>Cont FN</b>369 I take the point to apply to both unconscious and conscious perceptual states. For more on these issues, see <br>
the first three sections of Chapter 10; notes 388–399; and Chapter 16, the sections Visual Sensory Memory, <br>
especially, note 827, and Visual Working Memory.<br>

370 It is not obvious that attribution by the perceptual attributive part-of is transitive. Suppose that one per-<br>
ceives the whole line as a line, and every unoccluded part of it. For every sub-part of the line that is perceived as <br>
a natural-unit line part (perhaps a segment between two occlusions, or a segment between two places where the <br>
line significantly changes direction), one perceives every discernible part of the sub-part as a part of the natural <br>
sub-part. Perhaps one does not perceive every sub-part of the natural sub-part as a part of the whole line. Perhaps <br>
one only perceives the natural sub-parts as parts of the whole line. I do not believe this account, but I think that <br>
it is not empirically impossible. The issue hinges on how part-of attributives are computed when they are ap plic-<br>
able across natural perceptual units. I suppose that some part-of applications follow naturally from the iconic <br>
plotting of the natural units in a spatial framework. Whether all applications follow naturally from the iconic <br>
format or some are separately computed in complex scenes is an empirical matter.</div><div id="PGHEADER">
