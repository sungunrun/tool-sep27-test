if it were well established. I discuss these views, albeit briefly, in Chapter 19, the section <br>
The Cognitive Penetration Controversy.<br>
<br>
Of course, each proposal must be evaluated on its merits. In view of the poor track <br>
record of claims that the visual system is stocked with a great variety of categories of rela-<br>
tively sophisticated attributives—caution is in order.<br>
<br>
Expertise enables experts to perceive differently. It is easy, but mistaken, just to infer <br>
that experts must have sophisticated perceptual attributives for the kinds that mark the <br>
topic of their expertise: natural kinds of birds for bird watchers, types of cancer for readers <br>
of x-ray machines, types of antique pianos for music historians, and so on.<br>
<br>
Acquiring recognitional expertise consists, largely, in attending to low-level attributes <br>
and grouping them in new ways, through perceptual learning, and remembering them <br>
better.552 Familiarity affects organization of perceptual capacities for grouping shapes.553 <br>
Expertise-guided attention to specific shapes can help form learned groupings of shape <br>
attributives that provide a refined perceptual basis for applying <i>non</i>-perceptual attribu-<br>
tives. New spatial attributives may be acquired via similarity groupings. No new <i>range</i> of <br>
perceptual attributives (such as a natural-kind range for birds) need be acquired. Attention <br>
and grouping can depend on expert knowledge. Such knowledge does not introduce <br>
theory-laden perceptual attributives into the perceptual system.<br>
<br>
For example, acquiring expertise in spotting bird species can develop a capacity to <br>
attend to, group, and remember certain shapes, in ways that a non-expert would not. An <br>
ornithologist can group a range of body-shapes and beak-shapes to sharpen application of <br>
a bird-species concept. The novice sees the same body-shapes and beak shapes, but does <br>
not attend to similarities and differences. The novice does not group or remember them as <br>
the expert does. Such differences can motivate saying that the expert sees the world differ-<br>
ently. They do not motivate claiming that the expert has perceptual attributives as of bird <br>
species that the novice lacks.<br>
<br>
A second standard scientific approach to explaining cases that mistakenly yield assump-<br>
tion of sophisticated attributives in perception is complimentary to the first. This strategy <br>
postulates non-perceptual learning, in memory, of conceptual attributives. Applications of <br>
these conceptual attributives to instances relies on perception that uses less sophisticated <br>
attributions—for example, shape attributions—in perception.554, 555<br>
<br>
Claims that perception includes sophisticated perceptual attributives, commonly just <br>
assume that if an attributive is applied quickly and automatically on the basis of percep-<br>
tion, it is perceptual. Experiment and theory must determine whether an attributive is <br>
formed in a perceptual system, or is instead formed via processes operating partly on non-<br>
perceptual aspects of long-term memory.<br><br>

constitute new perceptual attributives. For example, in perceptual learning, a new grouping of curves of an edge <br>
of a 3-D volume shape as relevantly similar (perhaps in finding food) may yield a new perceptual edge-curve <br>
attributive. See Chapter 18, the section Perceptual Learning.</div>
