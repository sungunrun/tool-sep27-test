William Blake, <i>The Tiger<br><br>
</i>Chapter 10 described what is known of first-formed perception. Contrary to three for-<br>
mid able lines of thought that were current until 15–30 years ago, formation of perception <br>
as of spatially situated 3-D-shaped bodies does not require visual routines extended in <br>
time, visual attention, input from memory during processing, or input from supra-<br>
perceptual representations such as concepts. In this chapter, I begin to develop a fuller <br>
view of the visual perceptual system, with initial emphasis on perception that occurs <br>
between saccades. I highlight perceptual constancy and perceptual categorization. <br>
Although visual processing after the first 100 ms takes on input from more resources—<br>
principally more endogenous attention and both perceptual and conative memory—it <br>
remains <i>perceptual</i> processing. Indeed, it remains perceptual across saccades.<br>
<br>
Vision science undergoes constant change, of course. What we know is often at best <br>
approximate. In some parts of the science, knowledge is relatively firm and stable. In <br>
 others, it is limited. Informed conjecture is common. Any overview is, of course, vulnerable to <br>
scientific change. What I hope to do here is to describe some large features of visual per-<br>
ception—given what is currently known or well-supported. The largely descriptive caste of <br>
this chapter provides a basis for sharper understanding of psychological kinds—specifically <br>
of the scope of the perceptual system and various auxiliary perceptual-level sub-systems. <br>
Those topics dominate Part IV.<br><br>

<b>Two Changes in Scientific Understanding of Perception-Formation<br><br>
</div>
</b>Two large changes in standard views about visual perception-formation occurred in the <br>
last 25 years or so. One is the just-discussed discovery of very fast formation of percep-<br>
tual categorizations. The other is discovery of how complex and multi-directional the <br>
 formation of perceptual states is. I focus on this latter change in this section.<br>
<br>
In the 1980s and early 1990s, bottom-up processing was thought to hold sway, at least <br>
up to an intermediate stage of perception, roughly to a 2½-D sketch. The process was </div>
