298 The Iconic Nature of Perception</div>

(2) The mapping in (1) preserves correlations between some <i>relations</i>  among structural <br>
<br>
representational units of R, or within the repertoire in which it is embedded, and nat-<br>
<br>
ural relations among entities in the represented subject matter.<br>
<br>
(3) R represents the relevant entities, and relations among them, in the represented <br>
<br>
 subject matter, partly by way of the mapping cited in (1) and (2).<br><br>
Constituent (whole or part) representations or representational types are what enter <br>
into relevant mappings. In perception they are mapped to repeatable types in the environ-<br>
ment. Condition (1) allows a whole representation to count as a constituent.299 Condition <br>
(2) is to be interpreted to allow identity, or approximate identity, of type to count as a <br>
limit ing case of a relation. In that particular case, condition (2) would collapse into <br>
 condition (1).<br>
<br>
These points are intended to accommodate very simple iconic representations. A color <br>
chit lacks a structure, ordinarily understood. A chit might represent iconically via its <br>
color’s being the same as the color that is represented, and via use of the identity in <br>
representation.<br>
<br>
Normally, a color chit is part of a repertoire of color chits. Normally, the repertoire of <br>
color chits maps naturally into a spectrum colors that the chits match. In such a case, the <br>
mapping could be construed as holding between the repertoire and the color spectrum—<br>
not just between any given representation and some unit in the color spectrum. I think <br>
that it is not a necessary condition on a single color chit’s being an iconic representation <br>
that it be part of a repertoire of multiple color chits that match the color spectrum, and are <br>
used to do so.<br>
<br>
A mule might be used as an icon for a horse, because of approximate identity of shape. <br>
Similarly, arrows in a diagram might represent iconically, by virtue of mapping the <br>
 asymmetry of the arrows into the asymmetry in causal or temporal relations.300<br>
<br>
The naturalness of the mapping in Condition (1) can derive from a natural analogy <br>
between the structures of the representational contents and the structure of what they <br>
map. Preservation of natural relations, required by Condition (2), might be the source of <br>
naturalness in the mapping in Condition (1). One could iconically represent the spatial <br>
arrangement of a group of tanks on a battlefield by arranging a group of wooden matches <br>
on a table. The individual matches might bear no natural relation to the tanks. The <br>
 analogy between the spatial arrangement of the matches and that of the tanks makes the <br>
mapping natural, and the representation iconic.<br>
<br>
Conditions (1) and (2) are taken to allow that structural elements of a representational <br>
<i>repertoire</i> or <i>competence</i> be mapped into elements of a subject matter. Imagine a <br>
 synesthetic tactile system that produces a qualitative lightness in experiences (on the scale <br>
from black through grey to white) that corresponds systematically to degrees of hardness. <br>
Between the system of qualitative states and the degrees of hardness in bodies, there is a <br>
natural mapping relation. By looking at one sensory state alone, one could not determine <br>
that it is iconic in this way. However, greater lightness intensity bears a natural math em-<br>
at ic al relation to greater degrees of hardness. The whole repertoire or competence has a <br><br>

meant by a natural, systematic mapping in condition (1).<br>
