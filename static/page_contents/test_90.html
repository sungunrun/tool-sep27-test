proximal stimulus that function to correlate with direction—unless one perceptually rep-<br>
resents ordinal depth or distance as well. So the 3-D constancies are a watershed in the <br>
advent of spatial representation.<br>
<br>
The point applies to contour registration. Once contours are set in 3-D space, they are <br>
naturally considered attributes instantiated in the distal environment. Prior to being set in <br>
3-D space, contours are considered features of the proximal stimulus.<br><br>

<b>Visual Spatial Property and Relation Constancies<br><br>
</div>
</b>I forego here attempting to provide a detailed account of perceptual constancies for spatial <br>
properties like size, including length, and shape, and for spatial relations like ordinal depth <br>
and distance (from the viewer), location (with respect to the viewer), and shape orienta-<br>
tion (with respect to the viewer). These constancies figure recurrently in our account. <br>
Various factors in such constancies will emerge. However, the number of cues and the <br>
variety of computations that yield these constancies is quite large. The visual system takes <br>
advantage of many topological, geometrical, and statistical facts in the environment, and <br>
proprioceptively provided facts about the dispositions of the eyes (such as eye direction, <br>
and lens focus), in order to form representations of the layout and spatial properties of <br>
natural scenes. Any simple account would be facile.85<br>
<br>
A basic point about spatial constancies is that space and spatial relations are, strictly <br>
speaking, never themselves perceived. They lack the relevant causal powers to have effects <br>
on sensors that lead to perception of particulars. One does not perceive space or spatial <br>
relations. One perceives particulars <i>in</i> space <i>as</i> having spatial properties or <i>as</i> entering <br>
into spatial relations.<br>
<br>
One of the most primitive spatial constancies is ordinal depth constancy, the capacity to <br>
determine whether one perceived particular (say, a surface) is nearer or farther than <br>
another, with respect to the viewer. This constancy usually develops out of figure-ground <br>
determination. Figure-ground determination may occur as early as 25 ms after stimulus <br>
onset, grounded in neural activity in V2. Several cues are relied upon—initially, probably <br>
defocus, and local gestalt cues, such as convexity, relative retinal size, and contrast.86 <br>
Familiarity plays a role as well, but usually affects depth perception later in the processing <br>
sequence.87<br>
<br>
Central cues and computations of representations for spatial <i>properties</i> often derive <br>
from cues and computations for 3-D spatial <i>relations</i>. For example, a central cue in size <br>
constancy is determining distance or at least ordinal depth of a perceptual object, relative <br>
to the viewer. A central cue in determining shape is determining orientation. Determining <br><br>
