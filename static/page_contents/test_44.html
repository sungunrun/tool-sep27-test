I call the third element in perceptual representational contents a ‘<i>perceptual attributive</i>’. <br>
Perceptual attributives are representational competencies to characterize or relate particu-<br>
lars. They are generated by a perceptual system. They can occur not only in perception, <br>
but in perceptual memory, perceptual anticipation, perceptual imagining, and in guiding <br>
action. Perceptual attributives do not in themselves pick out, or refer to, particulars. They <br>
characterize them. The core of the representational competence that a perceptual attribu-<br>
tive is identical with is a competence to perceptually represent particulars as instantiating <br>
a specific property or relation.<br>
<br>
Perceptual attributives are antecedents of predicates or conceptual attributives. By <br>
understanding their operation, one understands the roots of predication in language and <br>
thought. Perceptual attributives differ from conceptual attributives in that only the latter <br>
function to contribute to propositional structures. A <i>concept</i> is an ability-general repre-<br>
sentational capacity that constitutively functions to contribute, as a sub-propositional <br>
component, to propositional representational contents and propositional operations, spe-<br>
cifically, inferences. A <i>conceptual attributive</i> is a concept that functions to characterize or <br>
relate entities (not necessarily particulars). Conceptual attributives function to be compo-<br>
nents in propositional representational contents. Not all concepts are conceptual attribu-<br>
tives. Thus 3, not, and that are concepts, but not conceptual attributives. Is a number, is the <br>
next natural number after, is an atomic reactor, is square (here understood to be expressed <br>
in language as a predicate) are conceptual attributives. Concepts constitutively contribute <br>
to propositional representational contents. Such contents are marked by a main-verb-<br>
phrase-like attributive whose primary representational function is to characterize, not to <br>
guide reference. (See also note 199.) Such contents occur in a network of propositional <br>
capacities, including capacities for propositional inference. Perceptual attributives func-<br>
tion to contribute to non-propositional representational contents of perceptual states. In <br>
both cases, the contents are kinds of representational capacities. Concepts are aspects of <br>
propositional capacities. Perceptual attributives are aspects of perceptual or perceptual-<br>
level capacities or competencies.<br>
<br>
In fact, perceptual attributives <i>are</i> psychological competencies. They are competencies <br>
to characterize, which are either themselves perceptual competencies or are reliances in <br>
other capacities (such as memory) on perceptual competencies to make the same charac-<br>
terizations made in perception. Perceptual attributives are representational competencies <br>
to respond, in repeatable ways, to repeatable types (properties or relations) in the en vir-<br>
on ment. The capacity to respond representationally to the same types in the environment <br>
on repeated occasions in a variety of stimulus conditions is the single most striking thing <br>
about perception. Responses to repeatable types in the environment under different <br>
stimu lus conditions are the primary topic of perceptual psychology. The types of <br>
responses are competencies. They are competencies not only to respond to those environ-<br>
mental types (properties or relations) representationally. They are also competencies to <br>
connect those types to particulars that instantiate them. For perceptual responses to <br>
repeatable environmental types function to serve the picking out of particulars in the <br>
environment. The service consists in aiding the picking out of particulars by localizing <br>
them as instances of repeatable environmental patterns. Studying how perceptual sys-<br>
tems form these re peat able representational responses to specific repeatable environmen-<br>
tal types—studying the formation of perceptual attributives—is <i>the</i> central occupation of <br>
the science of perceptual psychology. It constitutes psychology’s main contribution in </div>
