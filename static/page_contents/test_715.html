Empiricist Model of Perception and Cognition 715</div>

components of thoughts are concepts. Concepts can be as concrete as the most concrete <br>
perceptual attributives. Indeed, each perceptual attributive can cause a corresponding con-<br>
ceptual attributive with the same indicant and with a mode of presentation that borrows <br>
from a perceptual attributive’s mode of presentation. The concepts differ from the percepts <br>
not in their degree of abstraction, but in their uses—in being different representational <br>
capacities subject to different types of transformations.<br>
<br>
As I have repeatedly emphasized, perceptual attributives come at different levels of <br>
abstraction. Objects are perceptually categorized at very concrete levels relevant to dis-<br>
criminating individuals. They are also categorized at higher levels of abstraction, up to the <br>
level of generic body. A similar point applies to shapes, and to color. In most perceptual <br>
systems, there are perceptual attributives for very concrete shapes, and for a range of pro-<br>
gressively more abstract shapes, up to, and including, the property <i>shape</i>. In most percep-<br>
tual systems, there are perceptual attributives for the most specific color shades that are <br>
perceptually discriminable. There are also perceptual attributives for various bands of <br>
color shades, and groupings of such bands, up to, and including, the property <i>color</i>. (See <br>
Chapter 4, the section Taxonomic Hierarchies in Perception.) The most <br>
abstract perceptual attributives are generic capacities—say, to represent color, shape, body, <br>
and the like. Grouping is a common source of abstract levels of representation. Grouping <br>
commonly results from different more concrete types’ being useful in similar ways.<br>
<br>
It is true that there are no perceptual attributives so abstract that they make no dis-<br>
crimination, whereas there are conceptual attributives like is self-identical and quantifier <br>
concepts like everything that are that abstract. It is also true that one-place perceptual <br>
attributives must apply to particulars that are perceptually discriminable, whereas there <br>
are concepts like quark and divisible only by 2 that do not apply to entities that are per cep-<br>
tual ly discriminable. They are, in that sense, very abstract. But again, perceptual attribu-<br>
tives can be very abstract in their ranges of application, by most standards of <br>
abstraction<i>—body</i>, <i>color</i>, <i>shape</i>, probably <i>agent</i>, <i>cause</i>, <i>food</i>. One must take extreme care in <br>
applying notions of abstraction to cases. Offhand thinking about abstraction is an arch-<br>
enemy of clarity about a perceptual-level/cognitive-level distinction.<br>
<br>
The empiricist model is right to take perception to have a picture-like, imagistic format. <br>
All natural perception, but not all propositional thought, uses such a format. All percep-<br>
tion, but not all thought, functions to represent concrete particulars in a <i>de re</i>, cause-based <br>
manner. Thus perception, unlike thought, always has a foot in the concrete.<br>
<br>
Still, the empiricist way of taxonomizing perception and thought is seriously off track. <br>
Perception operates at many levels of abstraction even as it operates with an iconic for-<br>
mat—as levels of grouping illustrate. The most abstract conceptual attributives—those <br>
about mathematical objects or those that generalize in ways that make no partitions (is-<br>
self-identical, everything)—are in certain respects more abstract than any perception. <br>
However, many concepts occupy the same levels of abstraction and concreteness that per-<br>
ceptions do. Thoughts can be every bit as concretely picture-like and imagistic in format <br>
and mode of presentation as perceptions is. Some perceptual attributives are nearly as <br>
abstract as the most abstract attributives in thought.<br>
<br>
The empiricist idea that more abstract representations (or “ideas”) derive, in general, <br>
from more concrete imagistic ones by a process or act of abstraction is also a mistake. <br>
Sometimes, perception attributes <i>only</i> quite generic attributes, not specific ones—as first-<br>
formed perception illustrates. (See Chapters 10–11.)</div>
