504 Perceptual-Level Conation and Action</div>
<br><br>
Non-perceptual sensory systems provide many action-relevant discriminations that are <br>
never made into perceptual discriminations. Perceptual discriminations also overflow <br>
what action needs.<br>
<br>
Contrary to Gibson, the basic attributives in sensory perceptual systems do not repre-<br>
sent functional properties, or affordances. The fastest formed perceptual attributives in <br>
vision are attributives for spatial properties and relations, motion, colors, and lightness. <br>
These attributives have been found, on empirical grounds, to be computationally basic. <br>
Computationally basic representations in touch, hearing, and proprioception are analo-<br>
gous. Higher-level perceptual representation of such environmental attributes as <i>surface</i> <br>
and <i>body</i> are computed on the basis of low-level representation. If there are functional <br>
attributives in perception, as I have conjectured there are, they can be triggered only via <br>
triggering of the more basic perceptual attributives.<br>
<br>
Information processing by the visual system is, of course, shaped by behavioral tasks. <br>
There is substantial interaction between visual and motor systems. Vision can be biased by <br>
anticipations and feedback regarding bodily motion, including action. But vision can pro-<br>
vide accurate representations of environmental entities from retinal input alone, when the <br>
eyes and head are still. Perceptual representation does not, in general, depend on having <br>
learned action routines.<br>
<br>
Perception is, of course, <i>very</i> closely associated with action. Perception does con-<br>
stantly—I think constitutively—provide representation that is used, or can be used, in <br>
action. Some higher-level perceptual representations may have functional contents—con-<br>
tents like food or danger—that constitutively and directly serve action. To determine <br>
whether a type of attributive originates in a psychological system, one must look at the <br>
relevant science—perceptual psychology. It is a mistake to intone an action-imperialist <br>
view from the armchair, or from the viewpoint of a science (like social psychology) that <br>
lacks the methodological sophistication of perceptual psychology.<br>
<br>
The rest of this chapter centers on visuomotor psychology. I discuss one example—visu-<br>
ally guided reaching. The discussion anchors four themes. First, I outline the types of states <br>
involved in action explained in visuomotor psychology. Second, I discuss relations between <br>
the visuomotor psychology of action and propositional-attitude psychology for higher-<br>
level action. Third, I discuss ways in which much philosophical work in action theory over-<br>
intellectualizes its topic. I caution against purely armchair methods of deciding whether a <br>
piece of behavior is action. Fourth, I explain why “task orientation” in states that set action <br>
targets and in motor commands should not be taken to be cognitive in any sense that takes <br>
cognition to be at a higher representational-level than perception is. Perceptual states and <br>
representational actional states guided by perception evolved together. Conative represen-<br>
tation is not in itself more sophisticated than perceptual representation. Conative attribu-<br>
tives are, I think, probably entirely borrowed from one or another type of perception. <br>
Perceptual states and operations and primitive representational conative states and op er-<br>
ations are perceptual-level. I think them part of one perceptual-level computational system.<br><br>
