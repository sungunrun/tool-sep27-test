Fodor often seems to try to <i>explain</i> these facts about computation by reference to an <br>
independent notion of information encapsulation.1157 He thought that operations of <br>
modu lar systems are causally impervious to outside influence. The computations are said <br>
to be isolated from, or to be insensitive to, or to lack access to, information from outside <br>
the system—specifically from cognitive states. This strategy turned out to be a mistake.<br>
<br>
The strategy sounds plausible in the abstract. But inputs into computational operations <br>
have access to information carried by propositional states that influence <i>them</i> in restricted, <br>
but non-pathological, broadly sense-making ways. Computations are open to conceptual-<br>
level influence in producing perceptual-level input into computations. They use informa-<br>
tion from conceptual-level states, in the strict, statistical sense of ‘information’. But <br>
propositional states do not enter the computation. All the influence of beliefs and inten-<br>
tions is filtered through a perceptual-level (or lower-level) input into perceptual-level (or <br>
lower-level) computations.<br>
<br>
Neither Fodor nor Pylyshyn had a clear, independent conception of inaccessibility to <br>
information that could <i>explain</i> the fact that the computational systems do not take as <br>
inputs to their computations the propositional states, or their contents, or other cognitive <br>
information.<br>
<br>
Computational pattern is a distinctive psychological pattern. I am open to an in de pend-<br>
ent ly expressed, deeper characterization of modularity. So far, no such explanation has <br>
been given.<br>
<br>
Of course, computational explanation is possible for perceptual-level states partly <br>
because instances of such states are anchored in extremely complex, but inflexible rela-<br>
tions to stimuli. The function of such states is to pick out particulars through direct causal <br>
relations to them. Attributive competencies are exercised via these causal paths from <br>
stimulation. Perceptions are generated from present stimuli by complex but manageable <br>
laws of transformation. <i>De re</i> memory states form through anaphoric or fallible tracking <br>
relations to previous referential applications that bear direct causal relations to particulars. <br>
Stimuli that form perceptual-level states, generally, can be codified through these relatively <br>
inflexible relations. Memories function to preserve relations to past stimuli. Anticipations <br>
are built from past stimuli by relatively simple principles, including perceptual learning <br>
principles. Perceptual-level motor states derive in these direct ways from perceptual and <br><br>

<b>FOOTNOTES</b><br>
<b>FN</b>1157 There are exceptions. Very occasionally Fodor seems to <i>identify</i> encapsulation with there being a limited <br>
input into a <i>computational</i> device. There is the passage that I quoted this chapter, the section Conceptions of <br>
Penetration, from Fodor, <i>The Mind Doesn’t Work That Way</i>, 63. There is this passage from Fodor, <i>The <br>
Modularity of Mind</i>, 103 (cf. 116): ‘encapsulation has to do with the range of information that the device consults <br>
in deciding what answers to provide’. On this view, the computation that the mechanism carries out does not <br>
operate on input—directly treated as input—from cognitive states or their contents. Still, inputs into the compu-<br>
tation could be caused by and informationally sensitive to cognitive states and their contents, in an explanatorily <br>
illuminating way.<br>
Much more often, Fodor writes of encapsulation as causal ‘isolation’ from influence by propositional atti-<br>
tudes—as isolation from information. He cites Pylyshyn’s notion of impenetrability and invokes a notion of <br>
insensitivity to information. He also invokes restrictions on allocation of information to perceptual processing. <br>
See Fodor, <i>The Modularity of Mind</i>, 66–69. More decisively, in comparing encapsulation of input systems to <br>
reflexes, he explicitly <i>detaches</i>  the notion encapsulation from the notion computation. See 71–72. This passage <br>
suggests that encapsulation is to be understood in terms of isolation from even indirect causal influence from <br>
contentful states outside the system. Similarly, he writes that to show penetrability, one needs to show that the <br>
locus of a cognitive effect is internal to the input system: that ‘information fed back interacts with interleaves of <br>
input processing and not merely with the final results of such processing. . . . The penetrability of a system is, by <br>
definition, its susceptibility to top-down [cognitive] effects at stages <i>prior</i> to its production of output’, 73–74. <br>
Susceptibility to effects is a vastly broader notion than inputs into a computation. For further passages that <br>
emphasize insensitivity to influence, see Fodor, <i>The Modularity of Mind</i>, 114, 117.</div>
