Marcel Proust, <i>In Search of Lost Time<br><br>
Visual long-term memory</i>, VLTM, is memory that, without renewal, functions to retain <br>
visual representation for from about 15 seconds to a life-time. <i>Perceptual visual long-term <br>
memory</i> is VLTM that functions to retain perceptual representation.<br><br>

<b>Overview<br><br>
</div>
</b>Visual long-term memory has not been extensively explored.943 Much of the exploration <br>
to date has focused on aspects that are easily accessible to consciousness. Understanding <br>
how visual perception is retained in long-term perceptual memory must also include <br>
detailed mapping of the aspects of visual memory that are not easily accessible to con-<br>
sciousness. Exploration of hard-to-access aspects of <i>long-term memory</i> (LTM) is just <br>
beginning.<br>
<br>
Although it is common, fruitful, and possibly correct to regard visual working memory <br>
(VWM), conceptual short-term memory (CSTM), and various types of long-term mem-<br>
ory as distinct systems, and although there is evidence from pathology that there can be <br>
dissociations among them, the incompletely explored, unconscious underground of all <br>
these capacities leaves open the possibility that working memory is a consciously ac cess-<br>
ible “face” of a single underlying system. The neural evidence for dissociation is, as far as I <br>
know, non-decisive. I continue to write of different memory systems, recognizing that we <br>
are far from a secure understanding of the natural joints in the psychology of memory.944<br>
<br>
Visual long-term memory retains both perceptual representations and visually derived <br>
information that is conceptual, or otherwise cognitive. A similar point applies to visual <br>
working memory (VWM), verbal VWM, visual CSTM, and verbal CSTM.<br>
<br>
Perceptual visual long-term memory has a prodigious storage capacity. Over a period of <br>
5 days, subjects looked at 10,000 photographs for 5 seconds each. At the end of the  <br><br>

<b>FOOTNOTES</b><br>
<b>FN</b>943 There is work on memory for action. This work emphasizes comparing memory for one’s own action with <br>
memory for action described in language. Pre-linguistic long-term memory for action is an area that invites <br>
more research, especially action that is remembered proprioceptively. I have not explored this area, because of <br>
the focus on vision.<br>
