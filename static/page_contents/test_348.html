348 The Iconic Nature of Perception</div>
<br><br>
The analogs of lexical primitives are the perceptual attributives that have no other <br>
attributives as representational parts, the schematic markers of demonstrative or indexical <br>
capacities, and the occurrent referential applications. The primitive attributives include <br>
attributives for color, lightness, spatial properties and relations, attributives for motion, <br>
temporal properties and relations, attributives for <i>edge</i>, <i>surface</i>, <i>body</i>, <i>part-of</i>, probably <br>
functional attributives like cause, agent, danger, and so on. The list is determined <br>
empirically.<br>
<br>
All attributive positions are scope dominated by one or more referential applications. <br>
There are only a few types of schematic primitives—analogs of the ability-general that <br>
(and perhaps those) and indexicals hereego and nowego. Schematic primitives always <br>
occur in referential position, scope-dominating one or more attributives. Occurrent refer-<br>
ential applications exercise the competence marked by the schematic primitives. They <br>
dominate and are never dominated by attributives. Exercises of these basic referential <br>
and attributive structural elements are not iconic <i>per se</i>. They are not imitations of nature <br>
in the words of Van Hoogstraten, in this chapter’s epigraph. They are contributions <br>
of mind.<br>
<br>
The analog of a syntactical analysis of the lexical, linguistic primitives is relatively sim-<br>
ple. (See Chapter 4, the section Perception, Computation, and the Language-<br>
of-Thought Hypothesis, for my specific understanding of syntax in perceptual <br>
contents as an abstraction from certain aspects of the content.) Referential applications, <br>
exercising referential schemas, dominate attributives—producing noun-phrase-like <br>
structures of the form<br><br>
(that x1) . . . (that xn)(F(x1) . . . G(xn)).<br><br>
This form omits egocentric indexings and distinguishing intra-from cross-attribute <br>
attribution.<br>
<br>
An idealized form for that brown cubical body is:<br><br>
(that x1)[(that x2)(that x3)<br><br>
(brownr1(c)(x1), brownr1(i)(x2), cubicalb1(c)(x1), cubicalb1(i)(x3), bodyd1(i)(x1))].<br><br>
The “syntax”, or formal representational structure, of a perceptual state marks referen-<br>
tial applications (purportedly) to instances of the indicant of every non-relational <br>
attributive.<br>
<br>
Relational attributives are often, perhaps always, not referentially applied directly to <br>
relation instances. However, like one-place attributives, relational attributives are always <br>
dominated by referential applications. Their <i>relata</i> are picked out by referential applica-<br>
tions guided by non-relational attributives that are themselves also always dominated by <br>
referential applications. So, structures such as<br><br>
(that x1)[(that x2)(surfaces1(i)(x1), surfaces2(i)(x2), part-of(c)(x2, x1))]<br><br>
occur. The part-of attributive takes the iconic form of including the smaller surface within <br>
the boundary of the larger one. I omit the spatial attributives that incorporate the surfaces <br>
into a spatial framework anchored by a hereego.</div>
