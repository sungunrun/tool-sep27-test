258 Egocentric Indexing</div>
<br><br>
The proposed perspective-free, <i>purely</i> object-centered representation of shape would <br>
have to occur without perceptual representation of direction, of ordinal depth, or of dis-<br>
tance, from the perceiver. The authors present no evidence that such representation ever <br>
occurs. They make the mistake of thinking of shape representation completely in de pend-<br>
ent ly of representation of spatial relations to the shape. In actual visual perception, the <br>
representations occur together.<br>
<br>
A strength of the article is that it makes it plausible that 3-D volume shape perception is <br>
not, or is not purely, constructed out of manipulations of surface shape. The authors argue <br>
that because there is inevitably less certainty about the shapes of those parts of a 3-D <br>
 volume shape that are not in view, a visual system assigns a lower probability to attribu-<br>
tions of shapes of unseen parts of a 3-D volume shape than it does to attributions of the <br>
shapes of parts of the 3-D volume shape that are seen. Such differences of probability <br>
assignment are a natural consequence of the perspectival character of shape perception. <br>
The broadly Bayesian approach of the article is attractive.246<br>
<br>
The basic perceptual frameworks for representing spatial relations are <i>always egocentric</i>. <br>
An individual always perceives entities in spatial relations as being from the individual’s <br>
vantage point. A perceptual representation is <i>egocentric</i> by meeting two conditions. First, <br>
it represents perspectivally, usually from the spatial or temporal position of the perceiver. <br>
The contextually determined anchor is the point of origin for a framework. Second, the <br>
point of origin is psychologically privileged. A representation’s being egocentric does not <br>
imply that it functions to refer to the whole individual, as distinguished from a spatial or <br>
temporal position. Privileging in perception is architectural. The psychological system is <br>
set up to treat as special what is at the spatial or temporal anchor position and to utilize <br>
that position in guiding action. For example, the origin of a spatial egocentric representa-<br>
tional framework is marked as being in need of protection. An <i>allocentric</i> representation is <br>
one whose anchor is not psychologically privileged. In perception, a spatial allocentric <br>
anchor is usually not on the perceiver’s body.<br>
<br>
I turn to explicating the notion of egocentric spatial frameworks, in more detail.<br>
<br>
Spatial perception occurs in a <i>framework</i> in the sense that some part of environmental <br>
space is represented as being in a system of spatial relations. The idea of representation in <br>
perception of a single position that is not connected to representation of that position’s <br>
relations to other positions is, I think, impossible. Perceptual spatial representation is con-<br>
stitutively representation of particulars as being in positions, or in directions at ordinal <br>
depths, in a system of spatial relations. An anchoring position is the origin of the frame-<br>
work. Attributions of spatial relations are relative to this origin. Representation of spatial <br>
relations between positions of perceived particulars and the origin induce spatial relations <br>
among perceived particulars, because of the nature of a geometric or topographic system <br>
that represents the relations.247<br>
<br>
Perceptual spatial representational content maps in a part–whole manner into spatial <br>
layouts of the environment. I discuss this matter in some detail in Chapter 9.<br>
<br>
Of course, perceptual spatial frameworks do not represent all of space. They represent <br>
only space that includes perceivable particulars. The system goes indeterminate or non-<br>
committal in places—at great distances or behind some obstacles, for example.<br><br>

<b>FOOTNOTES</b><br>
<b>Cont FN</b>246 The article deals with very simple, proto-typical shapes, rarely present in natural scenes. The authors are aware <br>
of the enormous gap between present models and a satisfactory theory of shape representation and shape constancy.<br>
247 Kant, <i>Critique of Pure Reason</i>, B38, saw this point very clearly.</div>
