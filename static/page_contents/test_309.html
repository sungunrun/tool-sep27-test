there is a relatively direct correspondence between proximity in the neural maps and per-<br>
ceptual spatial representation of close-by stimuli, retinal and distal.320<br>
<br>
Shifts of attention correlate with such shifts in receptive fields of neurons in visual field <br>
maps. These shifts have been shown to have systematic effects on perceptual representa-<br>
tion of size, such as an increase of the perceived size of attended stimuli. The shifts in size <br>
are of entities in positions that relevant neurons respond to. Such systematic relations <br>
between functions of neurons that constitute spatially specific components in map-like <br>
neural registration of spatial properties (distal as well as proximal), on one hand, and per-<br>
ceptual representation of spatial properties, on the other, indicates that the format and <br>
representational capacities in the visual representation of spatial structures parallel spatial <br>
structures in the visual field maps.321<br>
<br>
Damage to areas of a neural map produces deficits in spatial representation that cor rel-<br>
ate with the damaged areas. Given that the brain can produce remappings after such dam-<br>
age and given that there are often many “back up” maps that can compensate for local <br>
damage to a map, there is no simple inference from an area of neural map damage to a <br>
spatial area for which visual perception shows a deficit. However, allowing for such com-<br>
plexities, there are mappings between areas in a neural map where there is damage and <br>
corresponding spatial perceptual deficits. The mappings indicate a topographical format <br>
for visual perception.322<br>
<br>
Psychologists working in these areas assume that these mappings between visual field <br>
maps in the brain and perceptual spatial representation are vastly more extensive than the <br>
cases that are now known, of which I have cited just a small sample. The fact that there are <br>
so many topographically organized neural maps and the limitations of current techniques <br>
in identifying and measuring them make investigating these relationships complex and <br>
slow-moving.323<br>
<br>
The role of spatial structure in determining iconic aspects of visual perception goes <br>
much further than a natural correspondence between the geometrical or topological <br>
structure of perceptual content and the layout of perceptual objects in space. Accounts of <br>
perceptual representation of specific spatial attributes in 3-D space use geometrical char-<br>
acteristics of edges and lines that are imprinted, 2-D, in retinal registration.324 The <br>
accounts are explicitly in geometrical or topological form. Patterns of local lengths and <br>
orientations of registration of edges in the (literally) spatial layout of the retinal image are <br>
used by the visual system in making estimates of larger patterns in physical space. The <br>
repeatable, ability-general representational content is taken explicitly, in the science, to <br>
have a geometrical or topological structure.<br>
<br>
More specifically, neural receptors are sensitive to the directional orientation of bars, <br>
edges, and other patterns in the retinal image, at various spatial scales. Recall from <br><br>
