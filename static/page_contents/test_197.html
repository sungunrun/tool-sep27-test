memory and anticipational states occur. The referential applications that would be rele-<br>
vant substituends in memory are, by hypothesis, lost to the psychology. The causal con-<br>
nections to specific, past perceptual referential applications have been lost. The referential <br>
applications that would be relevant substituends in anticipation do not yet exist. So the <br>
analogy to a language containing expressions substitutable into the position of the free <br>
variable, fails. The psychology, at the times at which the schematic memories and anticipa-<br>
tions occur, contains no relevant substituends.<br>
<br>
So the schemas are not associated with a set of substituends whose substitutability for <br>
the quantified variable provides the effect of generalization. The schemas become accurate <br>
or inaccurate only via singular occurrent events. These events are not available to the <br>
psych ology when the schematic states occur. Substitutional quantifiers yield a truth value. <br>
The schemas are not accurate or inaccurate, unless they are supplemented with occurrent <br>
referential applications that are appropriately causally connected to the schema (in the <br>
past or future). To be accurate, the memory schemas must connect causally to specific past <br>
referential applications; they do not generalize over just any substituends that might gram-<br>
matically fit into the schemas. To be accurate the anticipation schemas must connect to <br>
specific referential applications causally connected to the occurrent anticipational state. <br>
Again, specificity, not generalization, governs accuracy. The difference is conceptually <br>
important. It is the difference between generalization that yields a condition for veridical-<br>
ity and a schema that is constrained by specific singular representation.<br>
<br>
I have argued that both the representational function and the iconic nature of percep-<br>
tion preclude its including quantifiers or logical connectives in its representational con-<br>
tent. I have also argued that, even though perceptual memory and perceptual anticipation, <br>
unlike perception itself, can have indefinite forms—forms that lack occurrence-based <br>
applications to particulars—, they too lack quantifiers (and connectives). They do not <br>
truly generalize.<br>
<br>
In reasoning about the form of the representational content of perception, perceptual <br>
memory, and perceptual anticipation, it is crucial to distinguish content from mode. This <br>
distinction is well assimilated in theories of language. In them, it is common to distinguish <br>
firmly between negation and denial, and between disjunction and being non-committal.197 <br>
There is danger of blurring this well-established distinction in reasoning about non-linguistic <br>
psychological states, especially perceptual-level states. For there is no well-developed trad-<br>
ition of reflecting on the representational contents—the veridicality conditions—of such <br>
states. The importance of making the distinction is urgent in reflecting on perceptual <br>
anticipation.<br>
<br>
Consider a case in which a visual search turns up empty. An animal schematically anti-<br>
cipates a particular of a given type in a given context. The animal fails to perceive any <br>
anticipated particular of that type. The perceptual anticipation is never made veridical. <br>
The perceiver’s psychology shifts from perceptual anticipation to some reversal of antici-<br>
pation. The shift is a shift of <i>mode</i>. From being positively committal (anticipatory) with <br>
respect to the schematic representational content’s being fulfilled, the psychology shifts to <br><br>
