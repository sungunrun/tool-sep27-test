bird’s perceptual memory to attribute duration. I think that the case is paradigmatic of <br>
basic, perceptual-level attribution of duration.<br>
<br>
The case assumes that the bird perceptually represents the flower. Presumably, the bird <br>
perceptually attributes color and shape-instances and an instance of <i>flower-shaped flower-<br>
body</i>, and/or the event of consuming the nectar, proprioceptively represented. The pos-<br>
itions in 3-D space of these instances are also perceptually represented and perceptually <br>
remembered. When the bird takes nectar from the flower, a (probably unconscious) tim-<br>
ing mechanism is initiated in the bird’s memory. The initial time is attached to betoken-<br>
ings by these attributives (excepting the relational spatial attributives). When the time <br>
fixed by the system runs its course, the memory causes the present-tense command that <br>
Peacocke describes to revisit the flower. The memory is representational. That is shown by <br>
the use by the bird of perceptual representations at the beginning and end of the time <br>
span. Memory tracks a duration associated with the initial perception of the flower or of <br>
the eating, and it retains the position attributions. Perception as of the entities in the ori-<br>
gin al event is connected by memory with perceptual attributives in the command, and <br>
with perceptual guidance of the bird’s actions in fulfilling the command.<br>
<br>
Trying to explain the case without connecting representation of duration to perceptual <br>
representation would utterly fail to explain how the timing mechanism connects to the <br>
perceptual applications at the beginning and end of the duration and to the way percep-<br>
tual memory affects the conative command, the perceptual initiation and guidance of this <br>
command, and its issuing in action. The command is, of course, present-tensed. But dur-<br>
ation representation occurs in memory, not in the conative state. The duration is too long <br>
to represent in a single perceptual or conative state. Representational memory is past-<br>
tensed and represents temporal ordering relations. It integrates with perception by repre-<br>
senting duration. The bird’s memory connects the original flower perception at the time of <br>
the eating with the conative state that commands return to the flower. The initial percep-<br>
tion, the memory, and the conative state have roughly these forms.<br><br>

For simplicity, I assume that the bird remembers the body’s shape with the same per-<br>
spective or mode of presentation on the shape that the original perception employed. <br>
