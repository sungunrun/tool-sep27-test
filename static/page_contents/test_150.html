150 PercePtual reference requires PercePtual attribution</div>
<br><br>
Locke is indeed right in this dispute with Berkeley. But his being right is irrelevant to the <br>
authors’ position. Of <i>course</i>, objects are individuals to which properties belong. ‘The way <br>
this is believed to work . . . ’ has no relevant antecedent. The natural antecedent is a meta-<br>
physical fact—Locke’s fact. What they probably mean is that the way one picks out par-<br>
ticulars or objects to which properties (locations included) belong is provided by <br>
Feature-Integration Theory.<br>
<br>
Feature-Integration Theory does not address how objects are picked out in perception <br>
without <i>any</i> perceptual attribution of properties or kinds.160 I am not convinced that this <br>
theory demands that particulars be picked out without attributives. In any case, there is <br>
considerable evidence that Feature-Integration Theory is false. I discuss it in Chapter 10.161<br>
<br>
Susanna Schellenberg argues similarly, with no reference to Fodor and Pylyshyn, and <br>
with no reference to empirical work on perception:<br><br>
I am not arguing that the fundamental structure of perception is attributive or predica-<br>
<br>
tive, but rather that the fundamental structure is a matter of employing perceptual cap aci-<br>
<br>
ties that function to single out particulars . . . <br>
<br>
Burge has forcefully defended the view that the fundamental structure of perception is a <br>
<br>
matter of attributing general features to objects, thereby guiding singular reference (see <br>
<br>
Burge, <i>Origins of Objectivity</i>). According to Burge, singular context-bound perceptual rep-<br>
<br>
resentations must be guided by general attributive representational content: Perceptual <br>
<br>
content stems from attributing general features to objects. There are reasons to be suspi-<br>
<br>
cious of Burge’s central thesis. Barcan Marcus, Donnellan, and Kripke have shown that one <br>
<br>
can refer to an object in one’s environment even if the properties one attributes to it are not <br>
<br>
instantiated by the object. The point generalizes to perception: We can successfully single <br>
<br>
out an object in perception even if we get its location, color, texture, and a whole range of <br>
<br>
other properties wrong. . . . While cases of false attribution are compatible with Burge’s view, <br>
<br>
their existence, however, suggests that what ultimately guides perceptual representation is <br>
<br>
not attribution of general features, but rather something more fundamental.<br>
<br>
The Donnellan and Kripke cases are no problem for semantic particularism. On the <br>
<br>
view developed [by Schellenberg], singling out a particular is not in any way dependent <br>
<br>
on the attribution of general features. So the view denies the core Burgian [<i>sic</i>] thesis that <br>
<br>
there is a constitutive connection between perceptual reference and attribution of general <br>
<br>
features. In contrast to Burge, I am arguing that the property-instances that we perceive <br>
<br>
are particulars: The general elements in perceptual experience are the perceptual capaci-<br>
<br>
ties employed not attributive representational contents as Burge has it. So while Burge <br>
<br>
argues that we attribute general properties to objects and events in our environment, I am <br>
<br>
arguing that we employ general perceptual capacities by means of which we single out <br>
<br>
particulars, such as property-instances, objects, and events.<br>
<br>
There are several further advantages of semantic particularism over Burge’s attributive <br>
<br>
view of perception.162<br><br>

tion and only after objects were picked out, there would remain the question how the objects are picked out. The <br>
theory does not address this issue. I critically discuss Feature-Integration Theory in Chapter 10.<br>
