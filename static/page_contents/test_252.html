252 Attributives, Referential Applications in Constancies</div>

chain leads back from memory to perceived particular, and in no other direction. That is <br>
pure anaphoric connection. By contrast, in diachronic tracking linkage, later perceptual <br>
application in a linked sequence depends for its referent on the causal chain running <br>
through proximal stimulation to it.<br>
<br>
To illustrate how the formalization works, consider tracking within a single perceptual <br>
state. Tracking a body in motion occurs at very small, intra-saccadic time scales. (See <br>
Chapter 8, the section Egocentric Temporal Frameworks.) I focus on the aspect <br>
of a perceptual state analogous to Frege’s case (a΄-b΄). I ignore temporal and spatial repre-<br>
sentation that would be present. I focus entirely on the referential applications and an <br>
attributive for <i>body</i>:<br><br>
(that xa1)(that xa2)(bodyd1(i)(xa1), bodyd1(i)(xa2)).<br><br>
The subscripts ‘1’ and ‘2’ mark different referential applications. The superscript ‘a’ marks a <br>
common tracking file that both applications are linked in. This representational content is <br>
accurate if and only if both referential applications refer to a particular; the particular <br>
referred to by each application is a body; and the particular referred to by each application <br>
(belonging to the tracking file <i>a</i>) is the same particular, the same body. The particular is <br>
represented twice, given that formation processes could possibly lead to the perceiver’s <br>
perceiving two particulars instead of one.<br>
<br>
I take a case in which tracking is not internal to a perceptual state, but involves short-<br>
term perceptual memory. An initial perceptual state picks out a body (omitting further <br>
attributives):<br><br>
(that xa1)bodyd1(i)(xa1).<br><br>
A short-term perceptual memory retains the content of the perception, retaining the refer-<br>
ential application anaphorically. A subsequent perception, formed from a later proximal <br>
stimulus, functions to track the remembered referent. I assume here that the attributive for <br>
<i>body</i> does not change; the mode of presentation stays constant. The later perception func-<br>
tions to track the body picked out by the first perception. The function is not guaranteed <br>
success. For the second perception is formed from a new proximal stimulus. The referent <br>
of the referential application in the new perception is set by a different causal chain from <br>
the one that establishes the referent of the first perception and the memory of it. So the <br>
referential applications differ. They function, fallibly, to pick out the same body. They are <br>
linked in a tracking function, but distinguished by different cause-constrained exercises of <br>
the referring capacity.<br>
<br>
I take the relevant aspect of the second perception’s representational content to be:<br><br>
(that xa2)bodyd1(i)(xa2).<br><br>
The capacity to realize the tracking function is fallible. So the subscripts differ.<br>
<br>
Carrying a tracking relation from a previous referential application to a present one, <br>
guided by a categorizing perceptual attributive, is probably the main way of <i>perceptually <br>
recognizing</i> a particular. The recognition here involves memory. It operates at the percep-<br>
tual level, not a higher, cognitive level. (See Chapter 11, the section Levels of </div>
