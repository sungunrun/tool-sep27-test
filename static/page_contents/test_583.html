Trans-Saccadic Memory 583</div>
<br><br>
The issue of TSM’s storage capacity is complicated by another line of research. Evidence <br>
regarding how human perceivers approximate optimal routines of visual search, where the <br>
search stretches across saccades, suggests that TSM keeps a probability map for many <br>
positions in the visual field. In the relevant model, to which human performance approxi-<br>
mates very well, an ideal observer kept and updated probability distributions on 25 areas. <br>
I emphasize that, so far, these positions have been taken to be <i>retinal</i> positions, not spatio-<br>
topic positions. Each location is assigned a probability of the searched object’s being in the <br>
area. After a saccade, if the searched-for target is not found, probabilities are updated. This <br>
operation requires maintaining a lot of information about potential search locations. <br>
Saccades, ideally and actually, tend to be directed to a position with the highest probability <br>
at the time of the saccade. There are ways in which the performance of humans could <br>
result from a less rich memory retention than the model assumes. But TSM must track a <br>
substantial amount of information on a probability map.861<br>
<br>
Empirically supported models of automatic saccadic visual search suggest a memory <br>
capacity substantially larger than the capacity usually assigned to working memory. This <br>
retention of probability maps is not <i>obviously</i> identical with—and may be additional to—<br>
the capacity to retain information about visual targets, which I have already suggested <br>
may be four times the “slot” capacity usually assigned to visual working memory. I believe <br>
that it is not known how these different types of evidence fit together. There is some reason <br>
to believe that TSM may have a much larger capacity than visual working memory is <br>
widely thought to have. As we shall see, determining the storage capacity of visual working <br>
memory is itself in flux.<br>
<br>
Much of the information that TSM retains is from peripheral, non-foveal visual percep-<br>
tion. There is at any given time, much more non-foveal perception than foveal perception. <br>
So the “canvass” from which TSM draws its information is large. It processes a lot of low-<br>
grade, imprecise perceptual information. As we have seen, doing so is necessary to fulfill-<br>
ing its basic perceptual functions. An example of a basic perceptual function is using a <br>
peripherally perceived visual item as the target of an upcoming saccade in a visual search <br>
or in upcoming motor control. It would not be surprising if TSM had a fairly large cap-<br>
acity but used strategies that compensate for the lack of precision present in its representa-<br>
tion of peripheral targets.<br>
<br>
One of the main points of this discussion is that TSM is embedded in the visual system <br>
itself. Many animals encode a quite extensive visual field using retinas that have, within <br>
them, widely varying spatial resolution. Resolution and precision in foveal areas is vastly <br>
greater than resolution in surrounding areas. Animals, including humans, with such phys-<br>
ical equipment use quick eye movements to direct the fovea to target-objects and their <br>
locations. Two results are acquisition of higher quality visual information and adding pre-<br>
viously obtained high-quality information to memory. The high-quality information <br>
enhances setting and reaching targets of search and motor action. Making these shifts in a <br>
functionally efficient way requires memory and is the product of attention, often <br><br>
