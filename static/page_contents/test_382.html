382 First-Formed Perception</div>
<br><br>
Often subjects fail to detect changes that occur during saccades or behind occlusions. <br>
(Subjects are effectively blind during saccades, which last on the order of 10–30 ms.) In <br>
such cases, the changes themselves are never seen. One sees only the before and after. Such <br>
cases crucially concern memory, not perception alone. Then change detection requires <br>
comparison of a remembered perception with a current one.<br>
<br>
Some theorists claimed that overwriting, hence forgetting, explains change-detection <br>
failures generally.413 But as indicated earlier, specific properties of an object before a <br>
change are remembered, even when change in those properties is not consciously detect-<br>
ed.414 These memories, which are not immediately accessible to conscious retrieval, show <br>
up on priming and force-choice tests. These tests bring out what perceptions are retained <br>
in memory, even when memories that retain past perception are not easily consciously <br>
ac cess ible, on demand.<br>
<br>
In some cases, other types of forgetting, besides decay of a phenomenological image, <br>
may be factors. Some perceptions are not retained in long-term memory. They may not <br>
feed into long-term memory because they are not sufficiently salient. There is evidence <br>
that items that are attended to and that pass into working memory commonly enter into <br>
long-term memory, even if attention is withdrawn from them after they have entered <br>
working mem ory.415 Once such items enter into long-term memory, many are retrievable, <br>
on demand, as opposed to through force-choice tests. Many (but not all) change-detection <br>
failures occur over such short memory spans that long-term memory plays no significant <br>
role in the story.<br>
<br>
Two factors are especially important when the change is not detected—for example, <br>
when the change occurs during a blink or saccade, or behind an occlusion. Then, subjects <br>
have only the pre-and post-change perceptions to compare. These two factors are failure <br>
to retrieve into consciousness pre-change perceptions that are retained unconsciously in <br>
memory, and failure to compare them with post-change perceptions.416<br>
<br>
Some change-detection failures concern changes that occur in parts of the visual field <br>
that subjects are distracted from.417 Then the changes are often perceived and, at least <br>
unconsciously, stored. In such cases, change-detection failure again derives from difficulty <br>
in integrating the different perceptions over time so as to make the differences accessible <br>
to consciousness. As mentioned earlier, there is evidence that individuals can perceive <br>
change in the absence of accessibility to consciousness of any change. For example, <br><br>
