<b>The Fregean Source of Key Semantical Notions for Perception<br><br>
</div>
</b>I wrote in the Preface that Gottlob Frege fashioned central theoretical semantical concepts <br>
that are relevant to understanding perception.9 These concepts have been refined and sys-<br>
tematized by philosophers and mathematical logicians through the twentieth century. The <br>
concepts have been applied to the semantics of natural language and thought.10 Linguists <br>
appropriated the concepts from philosophy and mathematical logic in the 1970s.<br>
<br>
Frege was more concerned with mathematical thought than with language, let alone <br>
perception. Perception is not thought or language. It differs from both in fundamental <br>
ways. Still, four of his concepts are directly applicable to perceptual representation. <br>
I develop them, as they apply to perception, in Part II. I make some general points here.<br>
<br>
First, Frege’s understanding of predication, as functional application, took the key step <br>
in gaining a modern understanding of characterization, or attribution. Predication in lan-<br>
guage and conceptual attribution in thought are rooted in more primitive attribution in <br>
perception. Perceiving something as brown is perceptually characterizing it, making an <br>
attribution to it.<br>
<br>
As I use the term, <i>predication</i> is attribution that functions to contribute to a prop os-<br>
ition al structure. So predication is conceptual or linguistic attribution. <i>Attribution</i> in per-<br>
ception is not predication. Perceptual states are not propositional. They do attribute <br>
properties, kinds, and relations. Properties, kinds, and relations are <i>attributes</i>. Perceptual <br>
states characterize entities that they function to represent by representing them as having <br>
attributes. I use ‘attribution’ to cover both predication and the purely reference-serving <br>
characterization in perception (and in many uses of pictures). So attribution, but not <br>
predication, occurs in perception.<br>
<br>
Second, Frege took the key step in achieving a modern understanding of reference—in <br>
particular the “picking out” of a particular entity. The key step was understanding how <br>
singular reference fits with predication to produce a complex representation. Frege’s <br>
notion of <i>Bedeutung</i>, one form of which is a type of reference, was a highly theoretical <br>
notion, fitted to the semantics of logic and mathematics. However, close examination of <br>
his informal explications of relevant forms of <i>Bedeutung</i> (forms for names) shows that, <br>
in forming his technical notion, he reflected on the common-sense notion of singular <br>
 reference—picking out an individual entity. He was aware of connections between his <br><br>
