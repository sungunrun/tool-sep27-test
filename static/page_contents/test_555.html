different positions are foveated. The model needs only to assume that memory (presumably <br>
trans-saccadic memory) retains the most recently acquired visual information, in order to <br>
update a record of degree of similarity of perceived particulars with respect to the template. <br>
The successive updates build a probability distribution across scene locations—in effect, <br>
building a scene map—until a sufficient template match is arrived at. As noted, experiments <br>
show that saccade commands follow a rule that closely approximates the strategy that an <br>
ideal Bayesian observer would use for finding the target. A heuristic rule whose application <br>
does not require the full Bayesian apparatus (itself deemed biologically implausible) and <br>
that yields the same approximation has been proposed.<br>
<br>
In the experiments, subjects look at target-objects on a screen. Experiments take advantage <br>
of the fact that objects maintain stable position on the screen. Both the visibility map and the <br>
scene map are in this case, in effect, 2-D. The account abstracts from 3-D depth, size, and pos-<br>
sible movement of a target-object, and from possible changes in the target’s features (and <br>
changes in modes of presentation for features) that would occur as the perceiver or the target <br>
moved. So neither the experiments nor the explanation depend essentially on perceptual <br>
search in 3-D space. The distal scene map is 2-D. The account is seen as a first step toward an <br>
account of attention commands and saccade commands that are guided by perception and <br>
perceptual anticipation of objects in natural scenes. Fuller accounts, which would have to be <br>
much more complex, would take account of dis tinct ive ly 3-D aspects of visual search.<br>
<br>
It is clear that the account relies essentially on iconic maps. 2-D distance and position <br>
aspects of the visibility map, and of the constructed map of the scene, the 2-D scene, are <br>
central. For example, properties of movements to the center position among the positions <br>
of three candidate targets (‘center of gravity fixations’) figure in the account: closeness of a <br>
fixation to the positions of the candidate targets figures in whether a saccade to that pos-<br>
ition is appropriate. The iconic maps, retinal and distal, provide the natural format in <br>
which the psychological system solves its search problem. A model that dispensed with <br>
the spatial, iconic character of the maps and described map positions non-iconically AQ:1<b>Figure 15.2 </b>A visibility map of a 15-degree-circumference-sized part of a retinal image.</div>
