Perceptual Imagining 645</div>

In 1989 Shimon Ullman showed that rotation constancy in perception could be effected <br>
by unconscious mechanisms that rotate either a present perceptual representation of a <br>
specific type of object, or one or more stored templates that present the shaped object in <br>
canonical positions, so that the perceptual representation and the stored template coin-<br>
cide.1038 Later, vision scientists found that, in human and primate vision, perceiving 3-D <br>
figures that are rotated from a canonical view has the same temporal properties, at much <br>
shorter temporal scales, that comparisons of shape using mental imagery have. The time <br>
that it takes to perceptually attribute a shape that is not in a standard, easily recognizable <br>
orientation is often proportionate to the degree of rotation needed to bring the non-<br>
standard position into alignment with a standard position. So the timing/degree-of-<br>
rotation phenomenon that motivated Shepard and Metzler’s proposals about image <br>
rotation is taken by some perceptual psychologists to occur in unconscious mechanisms <br>
in visual perceptual processing.1039 The timing results in <i>perception</i> have been replicated <br>
and refined by numerous experiments. Response times for perceptual attribution—both <br>
behavioral and neural—are very often monotonically proportional to degree of rotation <br>
from canonical, familiar viewpoints.1040<br>
<br>
If mental rotation is an operation on mental imagery, it is almost surely not an op er-<br>
ation unique to mental imagery. Rotation operations in mental imagery would be versions <br>
of faster, automatic operations in visual perceptual processing. Rotating images would be <br>
co-opting a type of processing already operating in perception-formation, except that <br>
the operation would be conscious, under endogenous control, and guided by attention. <br>
The nature of the operation would be broadly the same in perception and in perceptual <br>
im agin ing, hence not supra-perceptual.<br>
<br>
I have put these points in subjunctive form because I think that it has not been estab-<br>
lished that mental rotation occurs in either imagining or perceptual processing. Some sci-<br>
entists think that <i>similarities</i> between orientations may be a dominant basis for producing <br>
the rotational constancies in perception. Such views explain the timing results in terms of <br>
similarity metrics that operate on the initial image, or perception, and some stored tem-<br>
plate. There is some reason to think that the timing results in perception derive from <br>
degrees of probability drawn from natural scenes statistics; slower responses derive from <br>
assignment of lower probabilities the more a shape is rotated from a familiar orienta-<br>
tion.1041 Some scientists propose that both similarity matching and rotation occur in <br><br>

the shapes were already represented, and that rotation only concerned the “handedness” of the shapes (whether <br>
they were mirror images of one another). Tarr’s results are contrary to both these assumptions.<br>
