environmental-location information, is registered in parallel searches for a given feature in <br>
a given feature-dimension.422<br>
<br>
This claim was given up in 1982. It was regarded as incompatible with evident capacities <br>
for pre-attentive texture segregation of features within a single dimension. Thus suppose <br>
that a boundary is visible between red letter-shapes and blue letter-shapes, with each type <br>
of letter shape on each side of the boundary. The boundary between red and blue can be <br>
found through parallel search, without substantial increases in the time required with <br>
increases in the number of colored letter-shapes to be searched. Detectors that yield no <br>
spatial information could not yield the differential responses to boundaries that subjects <br>
in fact produce.<br>
<br>
Facing evidence for pre-attentive registration of textural arrays of features within a <br>
dimension, Treisman and Schmidt revised the 1980 view that no spatial information was <br>
registered at the first, preattentive stage of processing. They came to hold that, within a <br>
single dimension of feature detectors, there is a proprietary pre-attentive map that carries <br>
spatial information. The maps for different dimensions were still regarded as not co ord in-<br>
ated. Coordination was supposed to depend on the second stage of processing. There, the <br>
different feature maps are brought together in a common spatial map ‘only serially, by <br>
attentive scanning of each item or group in turn’.423<br>
<br>
So at the first stage, there was supposed to be a feature map for each feature-dimension. <br>
Only later, were different feature maps supposed to be coordinated, through serial applica-<br>
tions of attention, into a map that comprises information about features from <i>different</i> <br>
dimensions. Although different sub-systems that register information about different <br>
attribute-dimensions were taken to carry some spatial information from the visual stimu lus, <br>
coordination and cross-referencing of such information were claimed to require attention.<br>
<br>
The 1980–1982 account of this first stage allowed for representation of free-floating <br>
attributes, unbound to other attributes from other dimensions. The 1982 theory was not <br>
very clear about the nature of the first-stage registration of spatial information. It is nat-<br>
ural to understand this information as retinotopic—as concerning information about spa-<br>
tial relations among proximal stimuli, or retinal registrations of such stimuli, not relations <br>
in environmental space. On the other hand, figure-ground grouping that partly prompted <br>
the change is relevant to environmental space. The status of the registration postulated in <br>
the first stage was never clarified.<br>
<br>
At the second stage, processing across feature-dimensions was claimed to occur. For <br>
example, color information is combined with shape information, via attention, to yield a <br>
perception as of a specific shape with a specific color. This occurrence of combination or <br>
<i>binding</i> is feature integration—the heart of the theory. In the theory’s form during <br>
1980–1988, binding not only combined different features. It combined features and spatial <br>
locations. Binding occurred on a master map of environmental locations.424 The dissoci-<br>
ated feature maps were held to activate positions on the master map.<br>
<br>
Production of a bound, located feature cluster, at this second stage, was taken to require <br>
serial application of attention to locations on the master map. Application of attention was <br><br>
