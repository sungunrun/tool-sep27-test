to both temporal representation within a perception and temporal representation in a <br>
 perceptual memory.294<br>
<br>
The first of the two quotes does not successfully state necessary conditions on all <br>
perceptual-level temporal representation. Not all temporal representation is explanatorily <br>
grounded in states ‘whose content involves duration and the past’, or that are ‘sensitive to <br>
how much time is past’. Just as not all spatial representation of depth represents a distance <br>
magnitude, as opposed to ordinal depth, not all temporal representation of pastness <br>
(or temporal order) represents a temporal magnitude. In fact, representation of temporal <br>
order is more basic than representation of duration. Hugely many memories do not at tri-<br>
bute a duration between remembered events and current memory. All memory is past-<br>
tensed, but not all is sensitive to duration. I do not see that temporal representation <br>
requires representation of duration at all, though most perceptual systems do represent <br>
duration as well as order.<br>
<br>
Peacocke’s second condition applies only to <i>de re</i> memory—memory that retains repre-<br>
sentation of past particulars. By far, most long-term memory is not <i>de re</i>. It does not retain <br>
representation of particular objects, events, or places that were represented earlier. <br>
(See Chapter 17, the section Ability-General Long-Term Visual Perceptual <br>
Memory.) It is not constitutive of temporal representation that it be <i>de re</i>. I do think that <br>
one cannot have schematic/generic perceptual memory except by losing <i>de re</i> elements <br>
from perception, which <i>is</i> constitutively <i>de re</i>.<br>
<br>
I stand by the view that temporal representation in memory is constitutive to percep-<br>
tual representation. I stand by the view that like other perceptual and perceptual-level <br>
temporal representation, the representation must be embedded in perceptual constancies <br>
for temporal properties and/or relations, and that the relational constancies depend on <br>
perceptual constancies for entities that can be perceived, unlike temporal intervals or <br>
moments.<br><br>

<b>FOOTNOTES</b><br>
<b>Cont FN</b>294 As far as I understand these conditions, excepting the talk of conceptions, they are met in the very example <br>
that I discussed. The bird’s perceptual memory is past-tensed and is sensitive to how much time has passed; and <br>
there are trackings of identities of the body, the flower shape-instance, and the place, that are preserved between <br>
memory and the initial perception, at least for a while. Of course, the memory could go ability-general (non-<i>de</i>-<br>
<i>re</i>) about body and shape, as long as it enabled the bird to get back to the position of the flower.<br>
I note, by the way, that temporal representation in perceptual anticipation does not meet these conditions. <br>
Perhaps all perceptual anticipatory temporal representation depends on perceptual memory.</div>
