<b>Categorization and Timing<br><br>
</div>
</b>The heart of mammalian visual processing is <i>categorization</i>. In a very <i>broad</i> sense, cat-<br>
egor iza tion is intra-attribute attribution. Here, I discuss categorization in a <i>narrower</i>, <br>
more traditional sense—one that targets a sub-set of intra-attribute attribution. The subset <br>
concerns attributes that tend to be <i>loci</i> for attribution of further attributes by cross-<br>
attribute attribution. Roughly, narrow categorization is of <i>kinds</i> as distinguished from <br>
properties (features). Classically, kinds are attributes that make instances what they funda-<br>
mentally are. Since for many entities, especially bodies, natural kinds loom large in <i>actu-<br>
ally</i> making an instance the sort of thing it is, and since perception does not attribute <br>
relevant natural kinds, accurate perceptual categorization via perceptual kinds frequently <br>
does not characterize what metaphysically determines the sort of thing the instance of the <br>
kind fundamentally is. Perceptual categorization is better thought of as classificatory attri-<br>
bution of kinds that the perceiver tends to treat as central in its practical and tracking <br>
activities. Such centrality tends to go with <i>loci</i> of cross-attribute attribution. These are <br>
rules of thumb. I do not intend to provide a definition of this narrower perceptual <br>
categorization.<br>
<br>
Attribution of <i>loci</i> for cross-attribute attribution can be termed attribution to <i>objects</i>. <br>
Surfaces, bodies, and certain body-parts are commonly objects for mammals. But edges, <br>
events, and other entities can count as objects. What counts as an object varies with per-<br>
ceiver needs and interests. Categorization has direct behavioral and evolutionary im port-<br>
ance. Being able quickly to perceive a face or an animal-body as such can be crucial to <br>
finding support and avoiding death. Talk of categorization in vision science tends to center <br>
on kinds that ground various explanations, especially action explanations. The heart of <br>
categorization in mammalian vision is attribution of various types of bodies, and body-<br>
parts (pre-eminently faces), using shape and size as primary cues.<br>
<br>
Again, one should understand <i>kinds</i> that visual perception attributes to particulars as <br>
what are typically the most basic initial identifying attributes of a particular that is of some <br>
importance to the perceiver. I take bodies to be the most important kind for human visual <br>
perception. Tracking bodies and body-parts tends to rely on generic or specific shape. For <br>
tracking bodies, generic shape—connected outer-boundary shape—is initially crucial. It is <br>
developmentally early in human children.525 Grouping more specific body-types relies <br>
heavily on more specific shapes.<br>
<br>
In sum, perceptual categorization is not a good guide to metaphysical essence. Kinds <br>
attributed in perception are <i>psychologically</i> basic. Instances of categorizing kinds tend to <br>
be treated in perception as attractors of other properties: they are frequent objects of <br>
cross-attribute attribution. They also tend to be referred to with widest-scope referential <br>
applications. (See Chapter 6, the section Scope Hierarchies in Perceptual <br>
Content and Scope and Modificational Attribution Hierarchy.)<br><br>

has been extensively studied by Elizabeth Spelke. See, for example, C. von Hoftsten and E. Spelke, ‘Object <br>
Perception and Object-Directed Reaching in Infancy’, <i>Journal of Experimental Psychology: General</i> 114 (1985), <br>

musical instruments, were explored by Thorpe and VanRullen, and by Potter and Hagmann, in work discussed, <br>
