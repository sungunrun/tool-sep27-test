siMple color and lightness constancies 81</div>

il lu min ations—and that helps make lightness constancy possible—is the set of ratios <br>
among relatively large differences in light intensity between adjacent areas in the retinal <br>
image.77 If one shines a red light on a scene, since the red illumination is constant, the <br>
ratios of light intensity emanating from different scene areas, with discernibly different <br>
light intensities, are roughly the same as they are when the scene is illuminated by white <br>
light. These ratios are calibrated against a constant presumption that in mammalian visual <br>
systems the lightest region is white, or approximates white.<br>
<br>
This operation is supplemented by a second operation that in effect distinguishes large <br>
differences in light intensity, caused by a shadow or by illumination, from large differ-<br>
ences caused by surface reflectance. Visual systems can make this distinction because it is <br>
statistically likely that shadow/illumination differences cause relatively fuzzy edges in the <br>
ret inal image, whereas differences in surface reflectance cause retinal edges that are rela-<br>
tively sharp.<br>
<br>
These operations—determination of ratios of light intensity among areas of the retinal <br>
image that involve large differences in intensity, and distinguishing illumination differ-<br>
ences from reflectance differences by distinguishing fuzzy from sharp edges in the retinal <br>
image—provide a rudimentary lightness constancy. These operations can occur prior to <br>
any determination of 3-D features of the scene. They can occur very early in visual <br>
processing.<br>
<br>
What marks a capacity for these procedures as a perceptual constancy is that they <br>
en able the visual system to represent a constant environmental attribute—surface light-<br>
ness—despite significant differences in proximal stimulation. But why do these operations <br>
yield such representations rather than <i>just</i> registrations of invariances in the retinal image? <br>
There is a separation of states that well match surface lightness in ways that ground fruitful <br>
causal explanations that advert to environment, from states that better match natural <br>
aspects of the retinal image. I try to make these points more vivid in the next section.<br>
<br>
Usually, perceptual constancies occur fairly far along in perceptual processing. Early <br>
operations in perceptual processing are typically pre-perceptual. However, perceptual <br>
constancies can emerge in very early stages of perceptual processing. The most rudimen-<br>
tary color and lightness constancies, of the sort just described, are cases in point. The <br>
operations that determine edge ratios of light intensity and that distinguish sharp from <br>
fuzzy edges of difference in light intensity are among the earliest operations in visual <br>
processing.<br>
<br>
So the mere-sensory-registration/perception distinction is not primarily a matter of <br>
earliness or lateness of visual processing. Nor is it a matter of degree of processing-<br>
complexity. Forming some non-perceptual invariances is computationally more complex <br><br>
