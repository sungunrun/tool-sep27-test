shape attributive on which it constitutively depends. The categorizing content differs from <br>
the shape attribution content in having further uses, not in not being iconic.<br>
<br>
More specifically, a particular generic perceptual attributive for <i>body</i>, when formed, is <br>
triggered by an attribution of a specific shape with closed outer boundaries. The body will <br>
“look” as the specific shape “looks”. The attributive for the specific shape is iconic. Since <br>
the generic body attributive’s mode of presentation borrows from the mode of presenta-<br>
tion of the specific shape attributive that triggers it, the categorizing attributive is also <br>
iconic. The mode of presentation of the specific shape attributive <i>and</i> that of the generic <br>
attributive for <i>body</i> involve plotting the shape in an iconic spatial framework. The body, <br>
presented as having generic shape, has a specific version of that specific shape in the spe-<br>
cific case in which it is perceived as having generic shape. The attribution of generic shape <br>
depends on attribution of the more specific version of generic shape. (Outer-boundary <br>
connectedness must be presented in a more specific way, even if the outer-boundary con-<br>
nectedness is just roughly sketched in perception.) The more specific outer-boundary <br>
 connectedness will have been grouped, in the psychology, with other more specific outer-<br>
boundary-connected shapes, because all serve certain uses. Hence the stimulus-<br>
dependent, occurrently presented attributive for outer-boundary-connected <i>body</i> will be <br>
grouped with other attributives for outer-boundary-connected bodies—outer-boundary-<br>
connected in different specific ways.<br>
<br>
Each of the triggering specific-shape attributives has a mode of presentation specific to <br>
the depth and orientation of the shape as presented to the visual system on a given <br>
stimulus-occasion. Each is plotted in an iconic spatial representational framework. A mode <br>
of presentation of an attributive that indicates <i>body</i> in this case differs from a mode of <br>
presentation of an attributive that indicates <i>body</i> when <i>body</i> is presented via another <br>
 specific shape, or via the same specific shape at a different depth or orientation. So there <br>
are at least as many generic categorizing attributives for <i>body</i> as there are specific shapes <br>
grouped by the perceptual system under <i>generic shape</i>, plus modes of presentation of all <br>
the depths and orientations (and sizes . . .) that those shapes can be perceptually dis crim in-<br>
ated as occupying. Instances of the different generic body attributives mark different psy-<br>
cho logic al states, with different potentials for speed of response, and so on. Generic body <br>
attributives differ from the corresponding shape (and size) attributives by being associated <br>
with more dispositional capacities—anticipations of outer-boundary-shape maintenance <br>
over time, for example. But both have <i>iconic</i> modes of presentation.296 The generic body <br><br>

<b>FOOTNOTES</b><br>
<b>Cont FN</b>296 Different generic body attributives individuated by their modes of presentation and psychological compe-<br>
tencies must be distinguished from different specific body attributives grouped by shape, and individuated by <br>
their modes of representation and psychological competencies. For example, a mode of presentation of the <br>
generic body attributive individuated via an occurrent stimulus by impala-shape, impala-size, at a given distance <br>
and orientation, must be distinguished from a specific body attributive individuated by a psychologically signifi-<br>
cant, standing disposition to group bodies by their impala-shapes (hence an impala-body attributive)—<i>even if <br>
the generic body attributive is individuated by a mode of presentation that involves the same impala-shape</i>, <i>impala-<br>
size,</i> <i>distance</i>, <i>and orientation</i>. So bodyimapala-shape,size,y14,distance-e63,orientation-o71 differs from impala-bodyimapala-<br>
shape,size,y14,distance-e63,orientation-o71. (Recall the hyphenation convention of Chapter 4, the section Two <br>
Methodological Points About Natural-Kind and Functional Attributives.) For one <br>
thing, the generic body attributive (so individuated) does not itself mark a standing grouping of impala-shaped <br>
bodies (impala-bodies) as a psychologically significant class. It is triggered on an occasion by a relevant impala-<br>
shape attributive, here the same one that triggers the specific impala-body attributive. But the generic body <br>
attributive just happens to characterize a generic body with the relevant impala-characteristics from the relevant <br>
perspective. A standing grouping of impala-shaped impala-bodies is different psychological capacity—a specific <br>
cat egor iz ing attributive for impala-bodies. Whereas every generic body attributive indicates the kind <i>(generic) <br>
body</i> and is accurate of every generic body, including ones without impala shapes, the impala-body attributive is <br>
accurate only of impala-bodies with characteristic impala-shapes.(<i>cont</i>.)</div>
