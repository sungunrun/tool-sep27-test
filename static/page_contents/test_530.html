530 Perceptual-Level Conation and Action</div>

one could take a poll of intuitions to find out whether such behavior is action, though in <br>
accord with some popular methodologies in philosophy, should be rejected.<br>
<br>
The ducking case falls under well-developed accounts of motor control that are, or can <br>
be, clear cases of relatively primitive action. The ducking motion can be associated with a <br>
quickly formed, perhaps unconscious, target-setting state—to avoid the approaching <br>
object. The ducking derives from an occurrent non-propositional motor command from <br>
the central conative system. The ducking is guided by perception and motor commands. <br>
The fact that the ducking conflicts with one’s conscious intention not to duck is compatible <br>
with much that is known about psychological systems for initiating action—systems that <br>
need not always coordinate with one another very well. Such ducking can be a clear-cut <br>
case of relatively primitive action.<br>
<br>
I propose no general account of what constitutively makes an event an <i>action</i>. The event <br>
must issue causally from the central conative powers of the agent, and do so in a way that <br>
is an implementation of those powers. Action can be diverted by distractors or memories <br>
that cause course changes. Take a case of distracted endogenous visual attention. When <br>
such attention simply follows a default saliency map, it is probably not active. The individ-<br>
ual does not seem to do anything; the changes are purely a product of the visual system’s <br>
following a pre-set schedule.727 However, I do not accept the view that endogenous atten-<br>
tion that is deflected from a given course by memory or by some distractor is necessarily <br>
non-active. We do quite ordinary things that are not intended, and that are shaped by dis-<br>
tractors: absent-mindedly strumming our fingers, for example.<br>
<br>
Action need not be representationally initiated, much less consciously initiated. <br>
Relatively primitive action <i>is</i> representationally initiated. Philosophical action theory <br>
should take more account of the variety of types of action, including primitive and rela-<br>
tively primitive types. Doing so is a necessary prelude to a fully general philosophical <br>
understanding of action.<br>
<br>
The two foregoing philosophical issues instantiate a third—whether the actional system is <br>
cognitive, in a sense of ‘cognitive’ that takes cognition to be a higher representational capacity <br>
than is perception. The reader will not be surprised that I take the answer, in a word, to be ‘no’.<br>
<br>
It is common in philosophy and even in the meta-patter of scientists to take “decision-<br>
making”, “planning”, and “practical reasoning” to figure in any psychologically guided <br>
actional system. Reflecting on psychological factors in accounts of relatively primitive <br>
action brings home the gulf between these factors and factors that figure in genuine prac-<br>
tical reasoning, conscious or unconscious. The processes are not more complex or sophis-<br>
ticated than those of perception-formation. Attributives in the conative states are <br>
perceptual attributives. If there are attributives distinctive to the action system that I have <br>
described, they are not more evolutionarily advanced, more sophisticated, or more <br>
knowledge-like than perceptual attributives. Visuomotor operations are no more sophisti-<br>
cated than operations in perceptual processing. There is no respect in which the visuo-<br>
motor system is on a higher representational level than perception. It is perceptual-level.<br>
<br>
Perceptual systems and perception-guided actional systems are natural, inevitable part-<br>
ners. They evolved together. No reason supports taking relatively primitive action com-<br>
mands to be cognitive, if cognition is taken to be at a supra-perceptual level of <br>
representation.<br><br>
