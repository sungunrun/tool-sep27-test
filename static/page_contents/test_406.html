stimulus onset. Gist representation is pre-attentive. Initial scene-gist representation is <br>
squarely perceptual.484<br>
<br>
The other type yields object categorization. This type isolates objects by surface shape <br>
and 3-D volume shape. It locates shapes, sizes, and objects, and categorizes them in ways <br>
useful for action and reaction. Such processing can use color. It tends to rely on spatial <br>
attributes. Several objects can be represented in a 20–30 ms glimpse. But representing <br>
more than two objects produces progressive degradations in accuracy.485 Object cat egor-<br>
iza tion does not depend on attention. Accuracy and speed can be enhanced by priming <br>
and expertise. But categorization does not depend on them. It does not depend initially on <br>
feedback from memory. Such categorization is perceptual.<br>
<br>
Science is in the early stages of discovering roles of lower-level representations of at tri-<br>
butes in object categorization. Unsurprisingly, speed and accuracy are affected by whether <br>
an object, say an animal, is in a canonical posture and by how large a part of the image it <br>
occupies. Categorization is speeded and accuracy is improved by representation of key <br>
components of the object to be categorized. For example, presence of face, eyes, or limbs <br>
improves accuracy by 3–8% and speed by 16–30 ms. Categorization does not always <br>
depend, however, on representation of typical parts. Overall shape is often crucial. Relevant <br>
shapes can be determined by humans and monkeys despite large deterioration in image <br>
definition, due to low luminance. Priming and expertise affect speed and accuracy, but are <br>
not essential for fast object categorization.486<br>
<br>
Categorization can occur as fast as image segregation. Often, as soon as one can isolate <br>
an object (distinguishing foreground from background), one can categorize the object—<br>
not just as a body or generic shape, or surface or surface shape, but as a specifically shaped <br>
body or surface. In good light and for upright animals, for example, attribution of <i>animal-<br>
body</i> is as fast as attribution of there being a whole enclosed shape. When objects are dis-<br>
tant, are poorly illuminated, or are not in canonical orientation, shape and object isolation <br>
tends to precede categorization.487<br><br>
