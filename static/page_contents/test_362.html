so impoverished that it cannot represent 3-D spatial relations.378 This view has been <br>
undermined empirically. What I am interested in here is a subsidiary argument for <br>
this view.<br>
<br>
Some psychologists argued that the number of spatial relations among objects in a rea-<br>
sonably complex scene is computationally too large to be represented all at once.379 In any <br>
normal perception of a natural scene, the number of spatial relations attributed is still <br>
enormous. What of the argument that such attribution is impossible?<br>
<br>
The argument would apply if relations among perceived items had to be computed indi-<br>
vidually. However, like a realist picture or movie, perception includes a repeatable spatial <br>
map<i>. Selecting out</i> and <i>stating</i> all the spatial relations encompassed within the map would <br>
be forbiddingly complex. But the iconic mapping of the relations is manageable, because <br>
spatial relations are attributed holistically in a spatial framework. Setting perceptual <i>repre-<br>
sentata</i> within a spatial perceptual framework engenders representation of multiple spatial <br>
relations simply by perceiving <i>representata</i>  in the framework. The holistic setting of spa-<br>
tial relations among entities in a map or picture is part of the point of the understated <br>
Chinese proverb.<br>
<br>
Answers to questions about spatial relationships (for example, determining whether <br>
one individual is next to another) are often already available from an iconic perceptual <br>
representation. The slowness manifested by individuals in answering such questions is a <br>
product of their having to select out a particular relational representation—in effect, <br>
retracing parts of the map that is already in place—to provide an answer on-demand. The <br>
retracing makes accessible to report what was already consciously perceived. Often what is <br>
not easily accessible to conscious report has been shown, through priming or forced-<br>
choice tests, to be present in memory.<br>
<br>
An issue that needs empirical research and philosophical reflection is how non-iconic <br>
representation emerges from iconic perception. Differences between perception and non-<br>
iconic systems of thought and communication are stark. A huge amount of information is <br>
encoded compactly in a normal iconic representation. There is some evidence that the <br>
iconic format of perception can facilitate inference and help solve some problems more <br>
efficiently than non-iconic, purely propositional inference can.380 On the other hand, rich, <br>
packaged, iconic representation is less flexibly useful in communication, especially if the <br>
communication is not about currently perceived topics. I think that the demands of <br>
 communication and perhaps other demands associated with propositional reasoning, put <br>
pressure on the packaging aspect of iconic representation and helped lead to the largely <br>
de-packaged character of linguistic representation.<br>
<br>
The foregoing exposition of the iconic nature of perceptual representation corrects the <br>
idealization in my linear presentations of representational content. Unlike linear linguistic <br><br>
