what was retained by TSM, it would be non-perceptual. It was understood that TSM <br>
served identification of visual targets in environmental space—for example, to support <br>
reaching for a target. The idea was that TSM helped perceivers locate targets in en vir on-<br>
mental space by enabling the psychological system to combine the retinotopic informa-<br>
tion provided by TSM with extra-visual information that supplemented the information <br>
about retinal position. For example, it was known that the visual system receives proprio-<br>
ceptive feedback correlated with eye-direction. It was hypothesized that such information <br>
was combined with retinal-position information provided by TSM to yield information <br>
about target direction. Motor movement could then be guided to a target’s location (direc-<br>
tion <i>plus</i> distance) by new visual information after a saccade.852<br>
<br>
This view contended with the hypothesis that TSM also retained information in spatio-<br>
topic, usually head-anchored, coordinates. This rival hypothesis is compatible with TSM’s <br>
retaining retinotopic information. It just adds that further information locates entities in <br>
environmental space, and counts as perceptual. On this hypothesis, TSM integrates ret ino-<br>
top ic and spatiotopic ways of mapping informational input. Until at least 2008, some promi-<br>
nent researchers took the balance of evidence to favor the retinotopic-only hypothesis.853<br>
<br>
In the interim, evidence has mounted that TSM retains spatiotopic information. The <br>
role of proprioceptive information about eye movement remains intact. Integration of <br>
information between pre-and post-saccadic fixations seems to depend on eye move-<br>
ment.854 Nevertheless, spatiotopic information seems to be retained in TSM.<br>
<br>
In the early 1990s, evidence showed neurons in the parietal cortex to be sensitive to <br>
stimulation from items positioned in environmental space, thus not purely to retinal pos-<br>
ition.855 The parietal cortex is known to serve TSM.856 This evidence suggested that TSM <br>
retains spatiotopic representation from visual perception. Evidence for revising the ori-<br>
gin al remapping hypothesis has accumulated. The hypothesis was long taken to interpret <br>
pre-saccadic shifting of the receptive fields of neurons as functioning to anticipate changes <br>
in mapping the retinal image. There is now, however, substantial evidence that mech an-<br>
isms of remapping center more on anticipatory selection of visual targets in 3-D space <br>
than on anticipation specifically of shifts in the retinal image.857<br>
<br>
Psychophysical evidence combined with neural evidence to further support the idea <br>
that TSM retains visual information in spatiotopic format, combining it with retinotopic <br>
information that it also retains. Studies of tracking motion across saccades, of visual sta-<br>
bility with regard to stable targets, of visual search, and of motor control across saccades <br>
all support the idea that TSM is a genuinely <i>perceptual</i> memory, retaining representation <br>
of visual targets and their positions in 3-D space, across saccades. Thus mechanisms <br>
involved in spatial perceptual constancies figure in what information TSM functions to <br>
retain across saccades.858<br><br>
