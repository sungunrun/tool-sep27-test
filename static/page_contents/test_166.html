166  Form and Semantics of Perceptual Contents</div>
<br><br>
The thought experiment evokes a semantically relevant difference between picking out <br>
an object <i>de re</i> and attributing property-types to it, on one hand, and picking out an object <br>
<i>de re</i> while attributing properties whose instances one also bears <i>de re</i> representational <br>
(perceptual/referential) relations to, on the other. Perceptual states function to bear <i>de re</i> <br>
relations to the instances of the properties that they attribute. One perceives the property-<br>
instances. Indeed, in such cases, one attributes both feature-types and instances of those <br>
features, to bearers of the properties (objects). (See this chapter, the section Betokening <br>
and Four Types of Perceptual Attribution.)<br>
<br>
The representational content of the first propositional thought is roughly:<br><br>
brown((that x1)body(x1)) & cubical((that x1)body(x1))<br><br>
(that body was brown and cubical)—I omit tense in the formula. I assume here that the <br>
thought bears a <i>de re</i> referential relation only to the body, not to any tropes.177<br>
<br>
I develop the form and semantics of the perceptions further in this and the next sec-<br>
tion.178 What is important here is to recognize the intuitive representational difference <br>
between the first and second thoughts. The second thought differs from the first funda-<br>
mentally because it relies fully on perception. (We could refine it so that it also relies on <br>
robust perceptual memory; so that the relevant thought is past-tensed.) The point is to <br>
elicit intuitively the additional representational element in normal perceptual attributions <br>
of feature-like properties. Veridical perception puts one in representational relation to <br>
instances of properties, not just the property-types. It does so through referential applica-<br>
tions to the property-instances.<br>
<br>
In fact, <i>all</i> perceptual states function to apply referential applications to feature-like <br>
property-instances. For one can perceive an instance of a kind or bearer only by perceiv-<br>
ing instances of one or more of its feature-like properties. One cannot see a body just as a <br>
body. One can see something as a body only by seeing at least its generic shape.<br>
<br>
I believe that one source of an anti-trope view, in both metaphysics and theory of per-<br>
ception, is preoccupation with language. Language usually marks <i>de re</i> representation of <br>
attribute-instances only for the main <i>topic</i> attribute of a linguistic unit, for example an <br>
attribute in the main, topic-setting noun phrase of a sentence. In normal uses of the lin-<br>
guistic phrase, ‘that brown cubical body’, the ‘that’ governs ‘body’ and functions to apply <br>
<i>de re</i> to a particular body. In normal usage, there are no ‘that’s that separately apply to <br>
instances (tropes) associated with ‘brown’ or ‘cubical’. Language often abstracts from the <br>
finest grain of thought and perception.<br>
<br>
There is, however, the semantical distinction just illustrated, in both thought and lan-<br>
guage. Normally, ‘that brown cubical body’ is read as applying the demonstrative <i>de re</i> <br>
relation only to the body, not to instances of <i>brown</i> or <i>cubical</i>. The linguistic expression <br>
has only one demonstrative schema and, when used, only one referential application. The <br><br>

<b>FOOTNOTES</b><br>
<b>Cont FN</b>177 In the case of the perception on which the first thought is based, the perceiver bears a <i>de re</i> relation to an <br>
instance of the generic shape (continuous outer boundary) attribute, and perhaps attributes no specific color (but <br>
presumably attributes <i>color</i> or at least <i>lightness</i>). The blocked off specification of the thought’s content is without <br>
<i>de re</i> relation to tropes of these generic shape-and color/lightness-types, only if the <i>de re</i> relations to them in <br>
perception are abstracted from or lost (say, lost to memory) in the thought.<br>
178 I leave finding the form of the representational content of the second thought as an exercise for the reader. <br>
The form will be evident when I lay out, in what follows, the form of counterpart perceptual representation.</div>
