a single attributive in the visual system that indicates the property <i>edge</i>, a single attributive <br>
for a given <i>L</i>, a single attributive for a given slant <i>S</i>, and a single attributive for the shape <br>
<i>straight</i>. According to minimalism, in a visual system, there is exactly one, canonical <br>
at tribu tive that indicates each attribute and one that indicates each attribute complex. An <br>
attributive is <i>canonical</i> if it is the only perceptual attributive that indicates its attribute.<br>
<br>
A minimalist elaboration of (I) holds:<br><br>
(Min)  In all exercises of perceptual constancies, the differences of perceptual states and <br>
<br>
perceptual representational contents in the different stimulus conditions are to be <br>
<br>
explained by postulating different canonical perceptual attributives for at tri butes <br>
<br>
<i>other</i> than the attribute on which the constancy centers. Each attribute that is con-<br>
<br>
stant in the different exercises of a perceptual constancy has only one canonical per-<br>
<br>
ceptual attributive proprietary to the attribute. That is, there is only one canonical <br>
<br>
perceptual attributive in the visual system that indicates that attribute, and only that <br>
<br>
attribute.<br><br>
According to (Min), in exercising edge-length constancy, the perceptual system combines <br>
a canonical perceptual attributive for <i>edge</i> and a canonical attributive for <i>length L</i> with a <br>
perceptual attributive for slant <i>S</i> (<i>S</i> is perpendicular to the line of sight) or distance <i>D</i>. In <br>
the second condition, the system combines the canonical <i>edge</i> and <i>length L</i> attributives <br>
with a different canonical attributive for slant <i>S1</i> (<i>S1</i> is the backwards slant) or distance <i>D1</i>. <br>
(I ignore representation of shape <i>straight</i>. Such representation operates as representation <br>
for <i>length L</i> does.) Combining the different slant or distance attributives with the one <br>
length attributive yields different complex attributives that attribute length <i>L</i> in different <br>
ways. The difference resides entirely in the different canonical slant and/or distance <br>
at tribu tives. The two complex representations represent the edge in different ways.<br>
<br>
(Min) holds that there is always only one canonical perceptual attributive that indicates <br>
any given attribute. For example, (Min) holds that there is one perceptual attributive for <br>
<i>length l</i>, and one for <i>straight</i>. The attributive complexes exercised in a perceptual constancy <br>
in different stimulus conditions always involve qualifications of the canonical attributive, <br>
length L. Qualifications are made by canonical attributives for other attributes that differ <br>
(here, <i>S</i> and <i>S1</i> or <i>D</i> and/or <i>D1</i>).<br>
<br>
Perceptual representation of slant and distance <i>is</i> part of perceptually representing the <br>
edge and its length. Normally, the perceptual system cannot represent one of these at tri-<br>
butes without representing the others. Any normal visual representation of an edge and its <br>
length, in exercises of the constancy, also represent slant. Normally, one cannot see the <br>
edge of a surface without seeing the edge as being at a specific slant. So the minimalist <br>
elaboration of (I) has an initial plausibility.<br>
<br>
Although the minimalist postulates exactly one non-complex representational content <br>
that indicates each environmental attribute that is distinguishable by a perceptual system, <br>
the minimalist remains broadly Fregean. The key idea of Fregeâ€™s point is a distinction <br>
between the entities in the world that are represented, the <i>representata</i>, and the represen-<br>
tational contents, or ways of representing, those entities. Minimalism preserves that idea. <br>
The distinction between perceptual representational content (the way an individual per-<br>
ceives an entity) and the entity itself is retained. Perceptual representational contents are <br>
structured kinds of perceptual capacities or capacity-exercises. The contents can be </div>
