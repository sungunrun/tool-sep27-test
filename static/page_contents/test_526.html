allows for tradeoffs between effort and speed, all in the interests of maintaining accuracy <br>
in meeting a set target. Speed, which produces higher variability in trajectories, can be <br>
increased or allowed insofar as it does not compromise accuracy. Energy in computing <br>
variations from trajectory and correcting variations is expended only insofar as it is <br>
needed to meet a target. Correction of all deviations from an initially set trajectory would <br>
be sub-optimal. The system needs to respond to noise and other sources of variation in <br>
trajectory as they arise, after the movement is begun—but only insofar as they would yield <br>
a trajectory outside the antecedently computed <i>parameters</i>  for success in meeting the set <br>
target. Feedback yields correction under a minimal intervention principle: expend no <br>
effort to correct deviation from average behavior unless deviations would compromise <br>
task fulfillment. The computations and corrections require the same apparatus of target-<br>
setting, perception, anticipation (which can cause corrections before sensory input <br>
arrives), memory, feedback loops, motor commands, and efference copy described above. <br>
They operate under the constraints just outlined.722<br>
<br>
I have focused on perceptual-level aspects of the system. There are also sub-perceptual-<br>
level aspects. Responses that derive from pre-perceptual proprioceptive registrations <br>
occur in the muscles. Responses also derive from signals sent from the spinal cord to the <br>
muscles. Such responses help resolve redundancy in ways outlined by optimal control <br>
theory. The lower levels of feedback are, of course, included in full computational accounts <br>
of relatively primitive action.723<br><br>

<b>Summary: Philosophical Issues<br><br>
</div>
</b>I conclude this chapter by touching on some philosophical issues. One concerns norms <br>
for action. What are relations between norms of optimality for relatively primitive action <br>
and norms for practical reason? A second issue has to do with the nature of action. What <br>
can be learned about what action constitutively is, or is not, by reflecting on relatively <br>
primitive action? These issues are instances of a third. Many scientists and philosophers <br>
write as if perception’s relation to the actional system is a relation to a cognitive capacity. <br>
The actional system is said to involve “task orientation”, “plans”, “decisions”, “practical <br>
reason ing”. Is the actional system a higher, more sophisticated representational capacity <br>
than perception? Is it a form of cognition?<br>
<br>
First, the issue about norms for relatively primitive action and norms for practical rea-<br>
son. Sensorimotor psychology often postulates a function of a psychological process, sets <br>
some natural parameters (such as level of noise), and proves a theorem about what an <br>
optimal result of the process would be, relative to the function and the parameters. <br>
Subjects are then tested to determine how near to optimal results actual performances are. <br>
The standard of optimality is an objective norm, given that the relevant functions and <br>
parameters are psychological kinds.<br><br>
