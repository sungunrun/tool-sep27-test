goals affect attention. So one’s starting point for forming empirical belief can be biased by <br>
direction of attention and by goals that are not disinterested with respect to empirical <br>
belief-formation.1055 No informed adult could doubt the general point that antecedent <br>
bias can bias perception and perceptual belief, in epistemically deleterious ways. <br>
Observation can be biased in many ways.<br>
<br>
In fact, no major philosopher after 1950 has thought that perception or perceptual <br>
belief is intrinsically free of possible sources of bias. The key issue that New Look-based <br>
and Kuhn-based philosophy of science raised was not whether perception can be biased <br>
by attention, background belief, or practical purpose. The key issue was whether empirical <br>
belief is checkable through observation in a way that leads to objective science. Perception <br>
and empirical belief are not immune to error or misuse, deliberate or unconscious. Science <br>
routinely checks experimental work for bias.<br>
<br>
Much has been made over whether bias comes from the initial direction of one’s eyes or <br>
from internal aspects of perception-processing affected by attention. I do not see that this <br>
distinction is of deep, principled epistemic importance. Either way, perceptual <i>belief</i> can <br>
be biased. Either way, perceptual belief (and by extension the underlying perceptual state) <br>
can be checked for bias. The <i>epistemic</i> importance of issues of cognitive penetrability has <br>
been vastly over-advertised, by the codified, dutiful, but unreflective references to Quine, <br>
Kuhn, and Bruner.1056<br>
<br>
In fact, the advertisers seem not to believe in their own product. Often, the epistemic <br>
issue of the objectivity of science and of common sense is raised in the first and last para-<br>
graphs of articles on cognitive penetration, but not discussed in the main body of the art-<br>
icles at all.<br>
<br>
A better reason for taking the issue of cognitive penetration to be important bears on <br>
the architecture of mind. Some philosophers and psychologists claim that the distinction <br>
between perception and cognition depends on whether visual processing is cognitively <br>
penetrable.1057<br>
<br>
Doubting a distinction between perception and conception has as background an <br>
idea in early modern philosophy. Descartes and early modern empiricists, such as <br><br>

<b>FN</b>1056 None of the foregoing is meant to deny that there are interesting issues of epistemic detail. Formulating <br>
<i>exactly</i> how possible cognitive biases in perception and perceptual belief affect formulations of what it is to be <br>
epistemically warranted—including identification of what needs to be checked and protected against to avoid <br>
epistemic bias—is a worthwhile philosophical, scientific, and practical project. For work in epistemology along <br>
these lines, see S. Siegel, ‘Cognitive Penetrability and Perceptual Justification’, <i>Nous</i> 26 (2012), 1–22. Little of the <br>
work on epistemology that refers to the cognitive penetration issue makes serious use of science. For work cen-<br>
