per turb ation and in the first group after errors began to occur despite the conscious strat-<br>
egy, were similar. Thus the initial time course of adaptation to the rotational perturbation <br>
seems to have been independent of whether subjects were engaged in a counteractive, <br>
conscious strategy.<br>
<br>
Evidence that adaptation by the first group was unconscious is that they were surprised <br>
by the errors and not aware of their directional tendency. Of course, this evidence is <br>
de feas ible. It appears that there were two responses to the perturbations by the first group: <br>
a slow unconscious adaptation and a fast conscious strategy change. After being initially <br>
effective, the latter response was overmatched by an unconscious adaptation. Unconscious <br>
adaptation proceeded in relative independence of conscious awareness or control.713 <br>
Given that nothing about propositional structure is utilized in models that explain the <br>
adaptation, it is reasonable to believe that the adaptation is grounded in sub-propositional <br>
mechanisms, not controlled by beliefs and intentions. Although adaptation can affect <br>
propositional attitudes, it has not been taken in psychology to be grounded in them. <br>
Computational models of such action and adaptation center on sub-propositional states. <br>
(See Chapter 12.) Indeed, even the conscious strategy can be computationally modeled as <br>
relatively primitive action, even though it is initiated by propositional instructions.<br>
<br>
Subsequent work showed that various mechanisms improve sensorimotor responses.714 <br>
The role of adaptation varies with the task. Adaptation involves updating based on sensory <br>
anticipatory errors. Force-field perturbations and visuomotor rotation perturbations, like <br>
the perturbation in the just-described experiment, impose systemic errors. Adaptation <br>
looms large in response to such cases. Skill learning tasks usually do not involve <i>systemic</i> <br>
perturbations. In those cases, reduction of variability seems to depend less on adaptation, <br>
which counters perturbations, and more on reinforcing successes. Conscious control fig-<br>
ures in varying ways, depending on the task. So sensorimotor learning—improvement <br>
through repetition in the performance of sensory guided motor behavior—is a complex <br>
phenomenon, including several interacting mechanisms.<br>
<br>
I turn to a summary of structural relations among the main types of psychological <br>
states that enter into relatively primitive action. Perception, commonly visual perception, <br>
fixes some environmental target-object. That perception, with other internal conditions, <br>
gives rise to a conative target-setting state. This non-propositional state may be caused by <br>
a propositional-level intention, as when subjects respond to instructions to reaching for a <br>
target. Or it may arise from an un-thought-out need—in an animal that lacks prop os-<br>
ition al attitudes, or a human under time pressure.<br>
<br>
The target-setting state is guided, and often initially caused, by a visual perception of a <br>
target. The target-setting state connects with a proprioceptive representation of the cur-<br>
rent state of those parts of the body that participate in acting to meet the target. Spatial <br>
positions of relevant body-parts are mapped proprioceptively to the spatial coordinate <br>
system of the target-setting visual perception. A difference vector marking a trajectory <br><br>
