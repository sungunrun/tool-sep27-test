Primitive Attribution of Mechanical Causation 447</div>
<br><br>
Unlike primitive representation of most spatio-temporal relations,569 primitive repre-<br>
sentation of causation—representation of <i>mechanical causation</i>—seems not to be egocen-<br>
trically indexed. It does not implicate the representer’s perspective in indicating the <br>
relation. What marks causal representation as a step toward the objectivity prized in sci-<br>
ence is not just attribution of a relation <i>per se</i>, but attribution of a relation not indexed to <br>
the representer. The world is represented as hanging together, without reference to the <br>
representer’s position or perspective in it.<br>
<br>
There is a class of representations of causal relations that is structurally different. I mean <br>
representation of causal relations between the representer’s own act, marked in some ego-<br>
centric way, and an effect of the act. Many have thought that this type of representation is <br>
the developmental and phylogenetic root of all representation of causation. The idea is <br>
that one learns about causation from one’s own activity on the world. As far as I know, this <br>
idea has not been shown empirically correct, although the issue is still open. Self-causation <br>
is attributed at latest by 4½ months. Mechanical causation is attributed by infants at 3 <br>
months.570<br>

Hume and Kant claimed that <i>perception</i> cannot represent causation. Hume held that, in <br>
collisions, all that we perceive (or attribute) is one body moving into contiguity with a <br>
second body and the second body moving away from the first right after being spatially <br>
contiguous with it:<br><br>
When we consider these objects with the utmost attention, we find only that the one body <br>
<br>
approaches the other; and the motion of it precedes that of the other without any sensible <br>
<br>
interval.571<br><br>
Motion in the second billiard ball, hit by the first, is a quite distinct event from motion in <br>
<br>
the first. Nor is there any thing in the one to suggest the smallest hint of the other.572<br><br>
Historians disagree over whether Hume held that representation of causation must <br>
derive from inductive inference. Some hold that he thought that we have an innate ten-<br>
dency to represent causation.573 In either case, he thought that the content of causal ideas <br>
have subjective features of expectation—such as that previously perceived regularities will <br>
recur. He thought that these subjective features are mistaken for objective attributes, like <br>
force or transfer of energy. He believed that force, transfer of energy, and the like, to be <br>
chimeras. He thought that the defensible content of causal ideas consists in attribution of <br><br>

Infants Younger than 6 Months of Age?’, <i>Developmental Science</i> 20 (2012), 43–53, show that representation of <br>
self-causation emerges by 4½ months. S. Liu, B. Brooks, and E. Spelke, ‘Origins of the Concepts Cause, Cost, and <br>
Goal in Prereaching Infants’, <i>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences</i> 116 (2019), 17747–17752, show that <br>
representation of causation among perceived entities emerges by 3 months.<br>
