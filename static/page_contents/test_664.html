knowledge.1081 More generally, information, or more specifically representation, stored in <br>
memory is often counted knowledge, regardless of the type or form of information, and <br>
regardless of whether any such representation is a belief.<br>
<br>
Such uses of ‘knowledge’ are colloquial, but offhand and metaphorical. They are like <br>
saying that a cricket knows that one is approaching, or that a worm knows that it needs to <br>
get away. The worm probably has no genuine representations, only non-perceptual infor-<br>
mation registrations. The cricket has perception, perceptual memory, and perceptual <br>
anticipation. But these capacities do not mark a state as knowledge, or as being on the <br>
other side of a perception/cognition boundary, where cognition is considered representa-<br>
tionally supra-perceptual. Such offhand uses offer no scientific guide in determining psy-<br>
cho logic al kinds. (See Chapters 16–18.)<br>
<br>
Priors, retained templates of category proto-typical instances, or retained representa-<br>
tions of object parts that figure in object categorization are sometimes referred to as <br>
knowledge of the object class.1082 Here, priors are not necessarily representations at all. <br>
They include probability weightings of certain potential sensory registrations or percep-<br>
tual representations. The weightings are not represented in perceptual-level systems. They <br>
are degrees of confidence. Retained templates are processed retentions or amalgam-like <br>
typifications of past perceptions. They are not a higher type of representation than percep-<br>
tion. Not all memory representations are knowledge in any sense that marks a higher-level <br>
representational capacity.<br>
<br>
These loose uses of ‘knowledge’ by psychologists tend to play little or no role in their <br>
theoretical contributions. Usually ‘knowledge’ or ‘cognition’ occurs once or twice in an <br>
article. Such uses are dispensable for the specific purposes of most articles in perceptual <br>
psychology. They do, however, contribute to muddying understanding of representational <br>
competencies.<br>
<br>
Some ordinary uses of ‘knowledge’ cite knowledge by acquaintance. One knows a friend <br>
by acquaintance. Knowledge by acquaintance is <i>neither</i> know-how nor knowledge-that. <br>
The ordinary use of the term, from which Bertrand Russell drew his theoretical notion, is <br>
not specific enough to guide one to a psychological kind that is representationally supra-<br>
perceptual—as cognition is supposed to be. For the ordinary notion of knowledge by <br>
acquaintance is a matter of competent, perception-based re-representation of a particular, <br>
with some familiarity from memory. That notion applies as well to perceptual memory, <br>
perceptual categorization, and perceptual recognition as it does to conceptual <br><br>
