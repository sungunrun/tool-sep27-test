science explicitly counts perception of such cases as exercises of time (duration) con-<br>
stancy.113 In fact, the capacity satisfies Peacocke’s own characterization of perceptual <br>
constancy.<br>
<br>
Use of cues to compensate for distance, and to scale for size of moving objects and <br>
length of motion path, is part of the same competence that tracks motion up close. A <br>
constancy is a capacity to represent a constant attribute or particular under a variety of <br>
stimulus conditions. The conditions must include the cues on which the constancy relies. <br>
Peacocke’s second example not only fails as a counter-example to the view that perceptual <br>
attribution of duration is associated with perceptual constancy. It tends to confirm <br>
the view.<br>
<br>
Perceptual temporal representation goes beyond attribution of intervals, either within a <br>
given perceptual state or across perceptual states, bridged by memory. Some types of cyclic <br>
temporal attributions depend on duration, but may attribute only order. Attribution of <br>
presence by perceptual states, and of pastness by perceptual memories deriving from those <br>
states, can sometimes track order, but not duration. These are very primitive types of <br>
 perceptual (or perceptual-level) attribution. I discuss these matters further in Chapter 8, <br>
the section Is TeMporal Representation Constitutive to Perceptual <br>
Representation? and Chapter 17, the section Ability-General Long-terM <br>
Visual Perceptual MeMory.<br>
<br>
Temporal constancies for temporal order are less demanding than constancies for tem-<br>
poral magnitude, or duration. All temporal framework constancies, both ordinal and <br>
magnitudinal, are coordinated with constancies for attributes of perceived particulars by <br>
indexing times at which these latter attributes hold. I develop these points in the last two <br>
sections of Chapter 8.<br><br>

ation does not have any proximal effects of its own. So proximal stimulation is undefined if taken to derive from <br>
a duration alone. They take proximal stimulation to come from physical particulars that have appropriate causal <br>
powers—entities <i>other than</i> times and durations. They characterize time constancy (here, duration constancy) in <br>
a standard way specialized to the case: ‘two different proximal events (different sizes and speeds but identical <br>
durations) are judged to be perceptually identical in the presence of 3-D cues but different in their absence’, 10.</div>
