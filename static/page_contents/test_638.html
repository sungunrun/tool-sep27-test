638 Perceptual Learning, Anticipation, Imagining</div>

“general knowledge”, or memory of “facts”, and is supposed to be transferrable from one <br>
context to another. Episodic memory is supposed to provide reference to events (or more <br>
broadly particulars) in a past-perceived situation. In the newer explication, episodic mem-<br>
ory had to be not only conscious but <i>self</i>-conscious. So explicated, episodic memory <br>
approximates <i>de re</i> long-term memory whose conscious access can be initiated by the <br>
individual (except that it is also supposed to involve “autonoetic consciousness”). Tulving <br>
took non-declarative—not voluntarily accessible—memory to be procedural, and <br>
stimulus-bound. He called both declarative and non-declarative memory “representa-<br>
tional”. Whether he understood ‘representational’ as I do, in contrast with a way that would <br>
apply to mere information registration is unclear to me.1013<br>
<br>
This taxonomy runs together some properties that should be distinguished. The form <br>
and function of a type of memory is one thing. Whether it is retrievable to consciousness <br>
voluntarily is another.1014 Tulving’s use of ‘knowledge’ also obscures differences between <br>
schematic perceptual-level memory and propositional memory. Whether conscious acces-<br>
sibility is self-conscious (autonoetic) is yet a further matter. Some long-term, consciously <br>
accessible perceptual memory involves and some lacks reference to particulars (long-term <br>
<i>de re</i> perceptual memory and ability-general long-term perceptual memory, respectively) <br>
that lack any consciousness of self. They have only egocentric anchoring of a temporal <br>
framework.1015<br>
<br>
In discussions of whether episodic memory is entirely a human competence, Tulving’s <br>
add-ons muddied the waters. Scientists who plausibly hold that animals—scrub jays, <br>
chimpanzees, and so on—have memory of, and anticipatory reference to, future particu-<br>
lars have been criticized from the standpoint of Tulving’s later taxonomy. Since the animals <br>
have not been shown to be self-conscious, or even conscious, in using relevant competen-<br>
cies, critics take the animals to have only stimulus-bound, procedural memory. Defenders <br>
and critics largely ignore questions about the representational content of animal memories <br>
and anticipations. Defenders usually drop requiring consciousness and self-consciousness. <br>
But they tend to fail to respond well to dismissal of their claims of reference to particulars <br>
in memory or anticipation. An important natural psychological kind is obscured—refer-<br>
ence to particulars in long-term memory and in anticipatory reference.1016<br><br>
