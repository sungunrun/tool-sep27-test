Scope and Modificational Attribution Hierarchy 187</div>
<br><br>
Illustrative representational contents for edges and surfaces that involve both categori-<br>
zational and relational attributions with edge and surface attributives follow:<br><br>
(that x1)[(that x2)((that x3)(flat(c)(x1), flat(i)(x3), edge(i)(x2), edge-of(c)(x2, x1), surface(i)(x1)))]<br><br>
(that x1)[(that x2)((that x3)<br>
<br>
(rectangular(c)(x1), rectangular(i)(x3), body(i)(x2), surface-of(c)(x1, x2), surface(i)(x1)))].<br><br>
In the first content, the referential application of surface (marked by ‘that x1’) scope-<br>
dominates that of edge (marked by ‘that x2’). Both dominate the referential application of <br>
flat (marked by ‘that x3’). In the second content, the referential application of surface <br>
(marked by ‘that x1’) outranks that of body (marked by ‘that x2’). Both outrank the referen-<br>
tial application of rectangular (marked by ‘that x3’). Edge-of and surface-of do not have <br>
proprietary referential applications. We do not see instances of these relations. We see the <br>
surface as a surface and the body as a body. We see the first as being in a surface-of rela-<br>
tion to the second.<br>
<br>
What is important for present purposes is that neither edge nor surface perceptual <br>
attributives are exclusively one-place modificational attributives. It is true that ‘edged’ in <br>
English is a term for a non-relational modificational use of the root edge attributive. The <br>
non-relational adjective is too unspecific to mark <i>which</i> edge something is edged by. In <br>
perception, the specificity of how things are normally seen is marked. The main uses of the <br>
edge and surface attributives in perception are categorizational and relational, not ad jec-<br>
tival or modificational.<br>
<br>
Obviously the nominal and relational forms bear close necessary relations. I conjecture that <br>
if x is perceived as an edge (or surface) of something, it is perceived as an edge (or surface).<br>
<br>
Shape and color attributives seem different from edge and surface attributives. I conjec-<br>
ture that they do not need relational companions. In language, and conceptually, ‘<i>cubical</i>’ <br>
has adjectival form. It appears to be derivative from ‘cube’. ‘Brownness’ derives from ‘brown’. <br>
I conjecture that the nominal ‘brown’ derives from the adjectival ‘brown’. In both language <br>
and perception, the modificational attributives function both to categorize their instances <br>
and to attribute what they indicate (and betoken) to other entities—in cross-attribute <br>
attribution.<br>
<br>
These modificational attributives, in <i>contrast</i> with the edge and shape attributives, seem <br>
to lack relational forms, at least in perception. Why? I am not sure. It may be that shape <br>
and color can be attributed to whole entities (including parts of natural wholes), whereas <br>
particulars perceived as edges and surfaces are always aspects of whole entities. Thus <br>
something (a part or a whole) is red, square, or cubical. It both has the red/square/cubical <br>
property and the particular red/square/cubical property-instance. Edges and surfaces are <br>
not properties or modifications of any particulars. No edge or surface characterizes a <br>
whole entity other than its instance.190<br><br>

<b>FOOTNOTES</b><br>
<b>Cont FN</b>190 Of course, in language, we can say that a body is “edged” or “surfaced” in the senses: has an edge and has a <br>
surface. I leave open whether these terms are capable of genuine cross-attribute attribution. I doubt that there are <br>
any analogous uses for edge and surface attributives in visual perception. The linguistic uses involve generaliza-<br>
tions that perception lacks. But perhaps there are schematic uses that approximate the generalizations implicit in <br>
language.</div>
