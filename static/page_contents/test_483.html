In Part IV, I describe capacities that naturally interact with perceptual states and processes. <br>
These are not capacities for perception. I argue, however, that key ones are <i>perceptual-level</i>. <br>
The discussion prepares deeper reflection on the notion of <i>perceptual system</i>.<br>
<br>
Being <i>perceptual-level</i> resides in five facts. First, attributives employed in perceptual-<br>
level capacities, with the possible exception of perceptual-level conation, are perceptual <br>
attributives. I conjecture that actual perceptual-level conation—the perceptual-motor <br>
 system—uses <i>only</i> perceptual attributives. All are borrowed from perception. Second, <br>
perceptual-level attributives (including any that are not perceptual attributives) are not <br>
more complex or advanced, in representational function or representational structure, <br>
than perceptual attributives. Third, the operations or transformations that these capacities <br>
enter into are not representationally, structurally, or functionally more complex, or more <br>
sophisticated, than the operations that occur in perceptual processing. Often, they are less <br>
sophisticated—often involving simple association. Fourth, when perceptual-level cap aci-<br>
ties interact with perceptual processing, the interaction is computationally integrated with <br>
purely perceptual processing. Fifth, normally though not always, perceptual-level cap aci-<br>
ties evolved in conjunction with perceptual systems, not subsequent to them.644<br>
<br>
A perceptual-level capacity other than perception is <i>relatively primitive conation.</i> <br>
Relatively primitive conation is a capacity that functions to initiate action, that constitu-<br>
tively coordinates with and is guided by perception, and that does not constitutively <br>
depend for its operations on supra-perceptual-level capacities including propositional <br>
capacities—such as intention, belief, or desire, propositionally construed. Another <br>
perceptual-level capacity is perceptual memory, in various forms. <i>Perceptual memory</i> is <br>
memory that functions to retain perceptual representation. Other perceptual-level cap aci-<br>
ties are perceptual attention, perceptual learning, perceptual anticipation, perceptual <br>
imagining, and certain types of affect. I discuss them in Chapters 14–18.<br>
<br>
Perceptual-level sub-species of conation, memory, attention, learning, anticipation, <br>
imagining, and affect not only operate at the same representational level that perception <br>
does. They are not cognitive penetrators of perception. They are psychologically inevitable <br><br>

<b>FOOTNOTES</b><br>
<b>FN</b>644 Exceptions that I know of are some types of endogenously controlled perceptual attention, endogenously <br>
controlled perceptual imagining, and perceptual episodic memory. I discuss these capacities in Chapter 15; <br>
Chapter 18, the section Perceptual Imagining; and Chapter 17, the section Episodic Visual Memory, <br>
respectively; De Re Long-Term Non-Episodic Visual Memory, respectively. All are natural extensions <br>
of other perceptual-level capacities.</div>
