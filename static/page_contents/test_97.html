changes in proximal stimulation. In general, registration of direction from the perceiver <br>
can be carried out by pre-perceptual, pre-representational mechanisms. For reasons dis-<br>
cussed in the previous section, it is only when direction is combined with either ordinal <br>
depth or distance that spatial constancies come into play. Translation plays a role in per-<br>
ceptual processing. Once a perceptual system can represent ordinal depth or distance, and <br>
can scale differences in size of a stimulus on the retina to be invariant for distal, en vir on-<br>
men tal size, translation of such representations—the perceptual system’s treating them as <br>
representing the same size and distance regardless of direction—is a perceptual constancy. <br>
Interestingly, although pre-perceptual translation is a very primitive capacity, probably <br>
present in non-perceiving organisms, perceptual translation may be available micro-<br>
seconds later than the most primitive size and depth constancies.100 Size and depth con-<br>
stancies seem to be processed quickest in a single direction, and become available for <br>
different directions micro-seconds later.<br>
<br>
Perceptual constancies for size and shape may rely partly on scaling and on 2-D rota-<br>
tion, or some analog of 2-D rotation such as similarity matching with stored templates. <br>
2-D rotation could figure in non-perceptual invariances as well as perceptual constancies. <br>
A sensory system could treat certain types of 2-D retinal patterns rotated in the plane, <br>
established by the retinal image, as equivalent. But by the stage at which grouping of <br>
3-D rotation in depth occurs, elementary spatial perceptual constancies are formed. <br>
Competence to represent a dog-shape as a given shape via either a proximal stimulus that <br>
derives from the dog’s standing up with its head angled toward the perceiver or a proximal <br>
stimulus that derives from the dog on its back, with its head angled away, would exemplify <br>
grouping of rotations in depth, a perceptual shape constancy.<br>
<br>
It is disputed whether rotation occurs or whether, instead, analogs of rotational group-<br>
ings are produced by statistical estimates based on various types of similarity.101 There <br>
may be several mechanisms that produce similar groupings.<br>
<br>
In any case, there is evidence that spatial constancy mechanisms produce the <i>effect</i> that <br>
affine rotational transformations would produce. These groupings appear to be among the <br>
earliest spatial perceptual constancies. They can be supplemented by further trans form-<br>
ations or invariances that are approximately equivalent to shearing and reflection. These <br>
further transformations may also occur relatively early in perceptual processing <br>
sequences—when, or soon after, the first 3-D constancies emerge.102 Finally, affine trans-<br>
form ations or other mechanisms that produce affine-like equivalences that are specific to <br>
important attributes are probably available toward the end of the first-pass, dominantly <br>
feed-forward processing sequence. For example, some types of invariances are specific to <br>
dog-shapes or even beagle-shapes. Perceptual representations associated with very specific <br>
shape-types are formed after the earliest, more generic spatial perceptual constancies.<br><br>

102 <i>Affine</i> transformations are functions that preserve points, straight lines, and planes. Sets of parallel lines <br>
remain parallel under such a transformation. Affine transformations need not preserve angles between lines or <br>
distances between points, though they do preserve ratios of distances between points lying on a straight line.</div>
