of currently unperceived matters. To contrast perceptual attributives with non-perceptual <br>
attributives connected to perception through inference, one must have a basis for distin-<br>
guishing perceptual from supra-perceptual attributives and operations. The argument <br>
provides no such basis. Infants’ anticipations may, as far as the experiments and arguments <br>
show, be examples of perceptual anticipations and perceptual operations. These may be <br>
dispositional capacities integral to having a perception as of causation: not dispositional <br>
bases for cognitive, supra-perceptual inferences.<br>
<br>
This second argument goes beyond the first in stressing integration of information. The <br>
argument points out that representation of mechanical causation is integrated with repre-<br>
sentation of endogenously caused motion. I discuss such representation in the next sec-<br>
tion, on agency. Representing endogenously caused motion (“biological motion”) and <br>
endogenous movers goes beyond representation of mechanical, “Newtonian” motion, <br>
which Michotte focused on. This second argument tells against understanding representa-<br>
tion of mechanical causation purely by focusing on the types of spatio-temporal relations <br>
visible in collisions. Suppose that visual systems represented only spatio-temporal rela-<br>
tions of moving entities. Then primitive representation of causation would have been <br>
shown not to be produced by a visual perceptual system.600<br>
<br>
What counts as part of the visual system is an empirical question. Visual representation <br>
is fast, automatic, and specific to a relatively limited domain of attributes. But what is <br>
included in the domain, and hence what counts as outside the visual system, are empirical <br>
matters. The cases of infant information integration are compatible with current under-<br>
standing of functions of the visual system, including its retentive and anticipatory func-<br>
tions. The cases are compatible with taking the visual system to integrate information <br>
about whether objects are inert or self-movers into representation of causation, including <br>
causation behind occlusions.<br>
<br>
A similar pattern occurs in visual body-tracking. Tracking behind barriers is known to <br>
be affected by antecedent information about the entities tracked. If an entity is shown to <br>
be a mass, say a pile of sand, rather than a coherent body, the mass’s presence and move-<br>
ment is not tracked behind occlusions by visual systems, as bodies are. If a body is broken <br>
into two pieces just before the pieces are occluded, the pieces are not tracked. Prior repre-<br>
sentation of the stable dispositional nature of entities figures in perceptual tracking. Such <br>
tracking involves perceptual memory and anticipation, not higher-level inference. As far <br>
as has been shown, integration of information about whether a body is inert or a self-<br>
mover into representation of causation is similar.601<br><br>

<b>FOOTNOTES</b><br>
<b>Cont FN</b>600 Some of what Carey and Saxe write makes only this point. However, Carey thinks that her arguments go <br>
further. She takes the arguments to support the idea that the representation of causation, though perhaps innate, <br>
is the product of a “central conceptual system” that integrates information from more specialized perceptual <br>
“analyzers”. See, for example, Carey, <i>The Origin of Concepts</i>, 246 and <i>passim</i>. This location in psychological archi-<br>
tecture would place primitive representation of mechanical causation outside the visual perceptual system, which <br>
is certainly not a central conceptual system. Primitive causal representation is supposed to first emerge in a post-<br>
perceptual, central, “core cognition” system. In one passage, Carey takes a sense of being conceptual to be that of <br>
having content ‘that goes beyond spatio-temporal vocabulary’ (Carey, <i>The Origin of Concepts</i>, 195). I think that <br>
this is not a sense of being conceptual. A lot of perception, for example as of body, goes beyond spatio-temporal <br>
vocabulary. Although I am critical on the issue of the boundary of the perceptual, Carey’s book provides wonder-<br>
ful resources for understanding central aspects of primitive representation.<br>

601 Current evidence indicates that tracking bodies behind occlusions emerges earlier developmentally <br>
(2 months) than representation of mechanical causation and tracking it behind occlusions (4–6 months). Thus <br>
the suggestion by S. Butterfill, ‘Seeing Causes and Hearing Gestures’, <i>Philosophical Quarterly</i> 59 (2009), 405–428, <br>
that the systems for tracking bodies and for representing causation are one system is incompatible with what (<i>cont.</i>) </div>
