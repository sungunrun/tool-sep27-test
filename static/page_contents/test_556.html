would be more cumbersome and unnatural. An account that appealed to propositions <br>
with iconic elements would invoke apparatus (the structure of propositions) not needed in <br>
the explanation. The models assume spatial, iconic framework and do not invoke prop os-<br>
ition al structure. The representational structure of the template and scene map is non-<br>
conceptual. The content of the representations is obviously perceptual-level or lower.<br>
<br>
This example again substantiates the first of the three points made at the end of the <br>
preceding section: The attention initiated by attention commands that guide saccadic <br>
commands is endogenous in that it is predominantly explained in terms of task-oriented <br>
rules internal to the psychology. The attention is not explained mainly in terms of the <br>
nature of the stimulus or low-level settings of stimulus reception. These are cases of <br>
en dogen ous attention that is not conscious or under individual control, much less a prod-<br>
uct of conceptual or other supra-perceptual states.<br>
<br>
The example also makes plausible the third point at the end of the preceding section. <br>
Successful, explanatory computational models do not make any assumptions about <br>
whether there are antecedent propositional or other supra-perceptual-level causes of <br>
perceptual-level initiations of endogenous attention. The model assumes perceptual-level <br>
attention commands and sub-representational registrations as causal initiators of en dogen-<br>
ous attention. No supra-perceptual-level causes are, or need be, assumed. So the computational <br>
laws are not affected by those cases in which there are antecedent, supra- <br>
perceptual-level causes of endogenous attention initiations that are themselves perceptual-<br>
level or lower. The computational models begin and end their causal explanations with <br>
perceptual-level states or are pre-representational.<br><br>

<b>The Executive Control System, and Propositional Drivers<br><br>
</div>
</b>Unlike the attention initiations discussed in the previous section, many endogenous <br>
perceptual-level attention commands constitute a type of individual control. Some of this <br>
control is effected through the <i>executive control system</i>, often called the central executive <br>
system. This system initiates representational processes through attention commands. It <br>
sustains, coordinates, or stops representational processes, by initiating fewer or more <br>
resources—prototypically through allocations of attention. Such functions operate at vari-<br>
ous representational levels. For example, the system operates at the conceptual level by <br>
exercising the mechanism by which an individual switches between a counting and a <br>
multi pli ca tion task. Or the system operates at the perceptual level by issuing an attention <br>
command that yields a saccade. When the executive control system operates directly on <br>
perceptual resources, its attention commands are perceptual-level.<br>
<br>
Here I focus on relations of the executive control system to endogenous visual percep-<br>
tual attention and relatively primitive, perceptually guided motor action. Over the last <br>
three decades, the system has gained prominence in investigations of the intersection <br>
between perception, memory, attention, action, and propositional cognition.794<br><br>
