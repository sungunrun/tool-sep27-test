Minimalism and Spatial Coordinate Systems 229</div>
<br><br>
The minimalist view is neat and simple. But it fails to accord with known empirical <br>
facts. The fact that I began this section with is that perceptual systems for representing <br>
spatial aspects of a scene meet conditions (1)–(3). These conditions entail that perceptual <br>
systems represent non-relational, perspective-independent properties like shape and size <br>
in ways that use a coordinate system with an anchor on the perceiver to compute repre-<br>
sentations of these perspective-independent properties. Non-relational attributives for <br>
these perspective-independent spatial properties are computed perspectivally, using <br>
(among others) cues for relations of distance and ordinal depth, which figure in represen-<br>
tation of orientation. The third condition also entails that perceptual systems are equipped <br>
to use coordinate systems to apply to shapes and sizes in conditions when the perceiver <br>
and the instances of shapes and sizes change position with respect to one another.<br>
<br>
As Figure 7.1 illustrates, in being computed from a capacity to map space from the <br>
perspective of the viewer, a constant, non-perspectival edge length will be represented dif-<br>
ferently if instantiations of the length differ in orientation or distance with respect to the <br>
viewer. The length representation is not just accompanied by a further orientation repre-<br>
sentation (although it <i>is</i> so accompanied). The representation that is proprietary to the <br>
length itself is different. It differs because the length is represented, and computed, partly <br>
through representation of the specific spatial positions that its instantiation in an edge <br>
occupies, relative to the viewer; and those positions differ in the two situations. The min-<br>
im al ist view fails to accommodate the aspect of a perceptual state that specifically and <br>
iconically represents length. (In the drawings, the proprietary representations for the <br>
length are lines.) On each stimulus occasion, a natural, psychological sub-unit—a one-<br>
place specific-length attributive—is perspectivally generated and situated in the co ord in-<br>
ate system. It indicates and attributes a non-perspectival, non-relational property. <br>
I illustrated these points both through commentary on Figure 7.1 and through imagining <br>
a numerically calibrated coordinate system.<br>
<br>
In treating the perspectival element in representation of non-relational, perspective-<br>
independent properties, like length, as residing entirely in representation of accompany-<br>
ing attributions of perspectival relations, like orientation, minimalism underestimates the <br>
natural-unit status of the iconic representations of length that are illustrated in the top and <br>
left edges in the two situations illustrated by Figure 7.1. The perspectival attributive for the <br>
non-perspectival, non-relational property gains its content and its relation to length <br>
through its use, which amounts to its being caused by lengths, and its causing responses in <br>
action that are relevant to length. The analog of the line in the drawing is an iconic aspect <br>
of a perceptual state. As we shall see in Chapter 9, this analog is closely associated with <br>
patterns in the brain that map onto lengths in the environment.<br>
<br>
Length constancy is a capacity to represent specific lengths as those lengths despite sig-<br>
nificant (perspectival) differences in proximal stimulation. Length constancy is not re du-<br>
cible to framework constancies like those for distance and orientation. The primary <br>
practical focus of visual perception is on non-relational, perspective-independent proper-<br>
ties. Those are the properties that an individual must primarily cope with in order to sur-<br>
vive—because they are properties of entities that are dangerous, edible, protective, or <br>
mate-able. Given this fact, it is not surprising that perceptual systems rely on several types <br>
of cues that “back up” one another. Perceptual constancies for such non-relational proper-<br>
ties as length (more generally, size, and also shape) normally rely on many cues, beyond <br>
those that yield representation of distance and orientation on specific occasions. For </div>
