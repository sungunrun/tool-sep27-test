242 Attributives, Referential Applications in Constancies</div>

on shape and color attributives. The reasoning of the previous section requires revision of <br>
the idea of single perceptual attributives brown and cubical. There is no perspicuous <i>lin-<br>
guistic</i> way to symbolize the huge numbers of attributives that center on the attributes <br>
<i>brown</i> or <i>cubical</i> that a perceptual system can compute. Perspectival differences for shape <br>
depend, partly, on different plottings in a 3-D spatial coordinate system. Perspectival dif-<br>
ferences for color depend on type and distribution of illumination.<br>
<br>
Perceptual representation of a color under one illumination is a different perceptual <br>
capacity from perceptual representation of the color under another. Perceptual represen-<br>
tation of shape in one orientation, with respect to the viewer, is a different capacity from <br>
perceptual representation of the shape in another orientation. Since perceptual at tribu-<br>
tives are perceptual capacities, perceptual attributives for a given color differ. Similarly, for <br>
shape attributives.<br>
<br>
There is further ground to think that perceptual attributives are what they are by virtue <br>
not only of what they represent, but also of how they represent it. Neural evidence indi-<br>
cates that the retinal information from which different perceptual attributives are com-<br>
puted in representing a <i>representatum</i> under a significant variety of retinal stimuli is not <br>
lost track of.224 This result should not be surprising. Introspectively, a perception as of a <br>
given shape or color from one perspective has a different “look” from a perception as of <br>
that attribute from another.<br>
<br>
In sum, an account of the form of perceptual representation must distinguish percep-<br>
tual attributives for a given <i>representatum</i>, where all them are linked in a perceptual <br>
constancy.<br>
<br>
A slightly more realistic way of marking differences among ways in which a given <br>
attribute is indicated and attributed is as follows:<br><br>
(that x1)<br>
<br>
[(that x2)(that x3)<br>
<br>
(brownr1(c)(x1), brownr1(i)(x2), cubicalp1(c)(x1), cubicalp1(i)(x3), bodyd1(i)(x1))].<br><br>
The formula marks both one of various perceptual attributives for a given attribute <br>
(<i>cu bic al</i>), indicated by the superscripts, and the unity among them, indicated by the words <br>
(‘cubical’) that derives from their being linked. The attributive for <i>body</i> has a specific mode <br>
of presentation deriving at least partly from the modes of presentation of the shape and <br>
color attributives that triggered the attribution of <i>body</i>. If the color were illuminated dif-<br>
ferently, or if the shape were at a different depth or orientation, the superscripts would <br>
differ. If the body were presented with a different shape orientation or a different color, the <br>
body attributive’s symbol would be superscripted differently. If the attributives are exer-<br>
cised in a perceptual constancy for one attribute, the main word-like attributive symbol <br>
(‘brown’, ‘cubical’, ‘body’) remains the same. A perceptual constancy is a network of these <br>
attributives (attributive capacities) linked in indicating and attributing a given attribute.<br><br>
