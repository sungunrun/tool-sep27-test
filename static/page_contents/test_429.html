involve activation of a memory from a prior perception, or with an activated memory that <br>
helps in tracking the particular. In recognizing the particular, it is often important to <br>
attribute specific details of a terrier’s shape, color, texture.<br>
<br>
It should be obvious that I am describing <i>perceptual</i> object recognition. Such recogni-<br>
tion is not cognitive or conceptual. Explanations of the workings of the relevant capacities <br>
do not invoke supra-perceptual-level capacities. Perceptual tracking uses memory, but the <br>
memory is just retention of perceptual attributives and either retention or file-tracking of <br>
perceptual referential applications. Perceptual object recognition involves only perception <br>
and/or perceptual-tracking, which involves perceptual memory, and/or a non-representational <br>
sense of familiarity. Of course, there is also object recognition guided by concepts. The <br>
point is that object recognition need not involve concepts. Object recognition can involve <br>
only perceptual categorization and either perceptual tracking (using perceptual memory) <br>
or a non-representational sense of familiarity, or both. (See Chapters 16 and 17.)<br>
<br>
When perceptual object recognition uses perceptual memory to track an object, recog-<br>
nition of a particular via categorization is mediated by a perceptual memory file using a <br>
referential application. Formalization of such recognition has the same structure that per-<br>
ceptual tracking does. Perceptual identification is a form of longer-term, commonly inter-<br>
rupted, perceptual tracking of particulars. (For discussion of formalization of tracking, <br>
including recognition, see Chapter 7, the section Referential Applications in <br>
Accuracy Conditions for Tracking Particulars; and Chapter 17, the sec-<br>
tions Episodic Visual Memory and <i>De Re</i> Long-Term Non-Episodic Visual <br>
Memory.)<br>
<br>
Of course, perceptual object recognition can rely on other things besides the specificity <br>
of a categorization. One can track a particular over time through substantial changes in <br>
properties. In focusing on relatively specific categorizations in supporting object recogni-<br>
tion, I do not mean to imply that such levels of categorization are necessary for object <br>
recognition.<br>
<br>
Some authors claimed that basic-level categories are the first perceptually applied cat-<br>
egor ies. Some even claimed that basic-level categories are applied as soon as the category <br>
<i>object</i> is applied<i>.</i>543 The weight of evidence, building from Thorpe’s work, indicates that <br>
some super-ordinate perceptual categories—<i>reptile-body</i>, <i>face</i>, <i>animal-body</i>—are attrib-<br>
uted first, along with, or just after, the super-super-ordinate categories for <i>generic surface</i> <br>
or <i>generic body</i>.<br>
<br>
There are many hypotheses about the temporal order of remaining category attribu-<br>
tions. Some propose that no level has priority: differences in speed hinge on contextual, <br>
“evidential” factors.544 I shall not discuss these differences. Work on categorization cites a <br><br>
