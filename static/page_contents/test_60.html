of environmental distal antecedents are superfluous in systematically accounting for their <br>
formation and causal role in a psychology. A sensory state is perceptual and representa-<br>
tional only if it is associated with a capacity to connect with a specific distal environmental <br>
attribute or particular in a way that is distinctive to that attribute or particular and that <br>
figures in causally explaining occurrences of that sensory state <i>better</i> than a naturally <br>
specified type of proximal stimulation does alone. That is a condition on perceptual <br>
ob ject iv ity and perceptual objectification. The way that distal environmental attributes <br>
and particulars figure in causal explanation is primarily in helping to individuate repre-<br>
sentational states in the explanations.<br>
<br>
Perceptual objectification is exercise of a capacity to separate local aspects of proximal <br>
stimulation from aspects more relevant to cuing environmental, distal <i>representata</i>—or, in <br>
the case of proprioception, constant bodily <i>representata</i>. Perceptual objectivity depends <br>
on perceptual objectification. Perceptual objectification marks being embedded in a <br>
perceptual constancy.<br>
<br>
Applying this reasoning relies on empirical scientific judgment about what count as <br>
“significant” differences in proximal stimulation. There is, by the science’s own lights, a lot <br>
of processing and filtering of pre-perceptual information-registrational states. There are <br>
equivalence classes, invariances, of types of proximal stimulation that are informationally <br>
registered by non-perceptual, non-representational sensory states. For the science, these <br>
different types of proximal stimulation do not count as “significantly” different. Those <br>
invariances do not count as <i>perceptual</i> constancies or invariances. I say more about how <br>
these invariances are distinguished from perceptual constancies in Chapter 3. The key, <br>
I think, is objectification.<br><br>

<b>Perceptual Constancy—First Mark of Representational Mind<br><br>
</div>
</b>Perception is the most primitive form of representational mind. The capacity that both <br>
constitutively grounds perception as representational and grounds empirically finding <br>
perception in animals is perceptual constancy. So the sign of the most primitive form of <br>
representational mind is occurrence of perceptual constancy, hence objectification in a <br>
sensory system.<br>
<br>
An epistemic value of the view is that it connects experiment and scientific theory, not <br>
just speculation, with one of the two marks of mind that an unusual philosophical consen-<br>
sus has arrived at, via a century and a half of reflection. The two marks of mind are con-<br>
sciousness and representation. Representation is here understood in the sense that requires <br>
that veridicality conditions be an aspect of the basic causal-explanation-grounding kinds <br>
of an individual’s states. For reasons given in Chapter 1, the section Situating the <br>
Topics of the Book, I lay consciousness aside. I center on representation. So center-<br>
ing on perceptual constancies in locating the most primitive forms of representational <br>
mind has the virtue of connecting scientific experiment and theory with a clear and widely <br>
agreed-upon conception of the main feature of representational mind—a state’s having <br>
veridicality conditions. One can find the most elementary forms of representational mind <br>
by tracking perceptual psychology in its identification of perceptual constancies.<br>
<br>
As I said, I believe that there are no serious alternatives to this way of finding the most <br>
primitive forms of representational mind. One alternative occasionally voiced is that a </div>
