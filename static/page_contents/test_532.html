<b>Forms of Perceptual Attention<br><br>
</div>
</b>Attention itself is not a representational state or operation. Only certain initiations of <br>
attention, attention commands, have representational contents. Some attention has no <br>
representational initiating causes, only information-registrational causes. All exogenous <br>
attention has such causes. Most initiations of attention studied in vision science are central <br>
elements in the visual system. Perceptual attention commands employ perceptual attribu-<br>
tives and do not enter into operations more sophisticated than those in other perceptual <br>
processing. In Chapter 19, I discuss cases in which propositional attitudes affect percep-<br>
tual attention and perceptual-level attention commands. The focus here is on the <br>
perceptual-level.<br>
<br>
All forms of attention are forms of selection.728 Perceptual attention highlights some <br>
aspects of perceptual states or processes, at the expense of others. Perceptual attention <br>
makes perceptual states and processes especially sensitive to certain aspects of incoming <br>
stimuli. Attention intensifies responses to some aspects and suppresses responses to <br>
 others. It also resolves conflict among competing responses, favoring some over others.<br>
<br>
It is often noted that attention is necessitated by the limited resources of the visual sys-<br>
tem. I think that one can expect that any visual system, no matter how primitive, has some <br>
capacity for selection that is the hallmark of attention.<br>
<br>
A model of attention, dominant for some decades, is that of biased competition. In <br>
 perceptual systems, the competition is among perceptual resources. The biased competi-<br>
tion model contrasts with a spotlight “from the outside”, in taking attention to be a product <br>
of weighted competing factors. The spotlight metaphor captures some of the selective <br>
in tensi fi ca tion of aspects of perception. It elides the fact that attention is an internal com-<br>
petitive change in the balance and course of psychological processing.729 The biasing has <br>
various origins—antecedent sensory sets, non-perceptual information-registration, per-<br>
ceptual attention commands, priorities or weightings in perceptual processing, perceptual <br>
memory, perceptually guided action tasks, propositional plans.<br>
<br>
I distinguish attention, which is a selective force that itself has no representational con-<br>
tent, from <i>attention commands</i>. Attention commands are conative <i>representational</i> states <br>
that function to initiate attention. Attention commands produce only endogenous <br>
attention.<br><br>

<b>FOOTNOTES</b><br>
<b>FN</b>728 A magisterial review is Carrasco, ‘Visual Attention: The Past 25 Years’. See also M. Carrasco, ‘Spatial Covert <br>
Attention: Perceptual Modulation’, in A. Nobre and S. Kastner eds., <i>The Oxford Handbook of Attention</i> (Oxford: <br>
Oxford University Press, 2014). Carrasco focuses on spatial attention and feature-based attention, with only curs-<br>
ory discussion of object-based attention. She highlights the enormous extent to which attention affects all levels <br>
of visual processing, including the earliest levels. She states that feedback of endogenous attention to ana tom ic-<br>
al ly early levels, such as to V1, occurs relatively late in visual processing, after about 160 ms. There is evidence, <br>
however, cited later, that indicates that endogenous attention affects <i>perceptual</i> areas faster than Carrasco sug-<br>
gests. It can affect perceptual processing inside 100 ms. See this chapter, the section Perceptual-Level <br>
Attention Commands and Guidance of Saccades.<br>
<b>FN</b>729 The biased-competition model comes from R. Desimone and J. Duncan, ‘Neural Mechanisms of Selective <br>
Visual Attention’, <i>Annual Review of Neuroscience</i> 18 (1995), 193–222. The known types and principles of biasing <br>
have grown numerous. Modeling applications of attention across various experimental paradigms has become <br>
complex. For examples of more recent “normalization” models, see J. Lee and J. Maunsell, ‘A Normalization Model <br>
of Attentional Modulation of Single Unit Responses’, <i>PloS ONE</i> 4 (2009), e4651; J. Reynolds and D. Heeger, ‘The <br>
Normalization Model of Attention’, <i>neuron</i> 61 (2009), 168–185. A broader model that extends normalization <br>
models and may supercede them is presented in O. Baruch and Y. Yeshurun, ‘Attentional Attraction of Receptive <br>
Fields Can Explain Spatial and Temporal Effects of Attention’, <i>Visual Cognition</i> 22 (2014), 704–736.</div>
