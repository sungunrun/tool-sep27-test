contents, the perceptual attributives, for a specific length and a specific shape each vary, <br>
depending on how these attributes are plotted in the coordinate system, relative to the <br>
egocentric anchor position. That is, the non-relational attributives for each specific non-<br>
relational property—the capacities exercised for attributing each given property in differ-<br>
ent perceptual states—vary. The attributives vary even though a given specific <br>
non-relational property is represented by the varying attributives. The capacity of a system <br>
to apply different attributives indicating each given property is a capacity for perceptual <br>
constancies for those properties. Note the intuitiveness of the different iconic ways of rep-<br>
resenting (and the different types of representation for) the same length.<br>
<br>
In this case, as in others, the perceptual constancy involves perceptual representation <br>
(as such) of different attributes, as well as a constant one, in different stimulus conditions. <br>
Here, distance of surface top from viewer and backward slant of the surface with respect to <br>
the viewer are non-constant attributes (here, relations) that are perceptually represented. <br>
In this case, as in others, the attribute that differs is cued as differing by sensory differences <br>
that yield differences in attributives that represent the <i>constant</i> attributes. For example, the <br>
cues to shape and size of the surface textural elements also cue the differences in slant. The <br>
attributives (for example, the line at the top of the surface) that are most basic proprietary <br>
to constant non-relational attributes (for example, <i>length l</i>) represent them differently in <br>
the different stimulus conditions.<br>
<br>
In the case suggested by the drawing, different slants or distances are, of course, repre-<br>
sented by <i>different</i> attributives in the two conditions. But for any given slant or distance, <br>
representation of that relation could be represented differently by a relational attributive <br>
for that slant, or a relational attributive for that distance, if there were a relevant difference <br>
in cues for that slant or distance. In our example, different distances of the top edge are <br>
cued primarily by textural cues, but also by statistically based, sub-perceptual retinal <br>
gestalt cues. Either of these cues could be used without the other—texture cues without <br>
gestalt cues, if enough of the edges were occluded; the reverse condition, if the surface had <br>
uniform texture, but all or most edges were open to view. Each of these three com bin ations <br>
of cues would cause different ways of representing a given slant of the left edge or distance <br>
of the top surface edge, and would cause exercises of different psychological capacities.<br>
<br>
So not only are there different attributives for constant non-relational attributes (<i>edge</i>, <br>
<i>length l</i>, and the sizes and shapes of the textural elements). And not only are there, in the pair <br>
of viewing conditions suggested by Figure 7.1, different relational attributives for the differ-<br>
ent relational attributes (specific slant and specific distance, or specific relative distance, of <br>
parts). The relations (or “relational properties”)—distance of the top edge from the viewer, <br>
slant of the left edge with respect to the viewer, or slant of the surface with respect to the <br>
viewer—that differ in the two viewing conditions could have remained constant, in other <br>
pairs of viewing conditions. While remaining constant, they could be represented in differ-<br>
ent ways. Different attributives could have applied to constant <i>relational</i> attributes. The dif-<br>
ferent attributives for a given relation (say, specific distance of an edge from the viewer) <br>
would be psychologically different ways of representing the given relation. The attributives <br>
are different if they are cued differently. The different attributions of the same relation would <br>
be exercises of different psychological capacities, contributing to different psychological <br>
states, with different psychological properties, cued by different types of stimuli.<br>
<br>
Since perceptual attributives just are basic types of psychological capacities to attribute, <br>
different attributives that represent a given attribute have different psychological </div>
