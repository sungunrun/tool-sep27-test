Visual Working Memory 595</div>
<br><br>
Even when distractions do not occur, much is omitted from visual working memory’s <br>
conscious sketch. Scans of attention, repetitions of similar working memory con fig ur ations, <br>
rehearsals of remembered items, and matching patterns in working memory with patterns <br>
in long-term memory help account for our ability sometimes to remember, icon ic al ly in <br>
long-term memory, a scene with some richness. These re-enforcements operate on an <br>
unconscious memory substrate, some of which may not be consciously retrievable, that is <br>
much richer than the conscious memory that survives the working-memory bottleneck.<br>
<br>
The full range of functions of working memory is not yet well understood. I sketch <br>
main functions—well established or likely.<br>
<br>
In the previous section, I remarked that some have proposed that trans-saccadic mem-<br>
ory is an implementation of visual working memory. There is evidence that working <br>
memory has some of the functions of trans-saccadic memory.890 The issue remains open.<br>
<br>
One of the primary, well-established functions of working memory is to retain informa-<br>
tion through shifts of attention during conscious visual searches that are substantially <br>
longer than search across a couple of saccades.891 Working memory keeps track of loca-<br>
tions that have been searched previously. For example, working memory is needed to <br>
determine whether all the upright rectangles in a scattered array have a grey left side and a <br>
white right side. To obtain the information from a search, one has to use retained informa-<br>
tion in determining whether new information fulfills the aim of the search. This role may <br>
figure even in saccadic eye movement. Of course, the information retained includes pre-<br>
perceptual information registration.892<br>
<br>
Suppose that individuals are asked to determine whether two dots separated in space <br>
are located on the same edge. Each is clearly on an edge (same or different). The edges are <br>
embedded in a tangle of edges. Imagine the edges to be like irregularly undulating lines, <br>
analogous to the edges of branches in a tangle of tree limbs. Individuals search to solve the <br>
problem. The search is usually experienced as an attention-backed tracing of an edge from <br>
one dot toward the other. Working memory is essential to carrying out the task.893<br><br>
