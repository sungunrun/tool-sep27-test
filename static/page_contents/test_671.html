Uses and Misuses of the Term ‘Cognition’ 671</div>

A primary lesson is again that processing in the visual system is multi-directional. Some <br>
feedback is from currently formed perception itself. No feedback from endogenous atten-<br>
tion commands, target representation, memory, or anticipation is <i>necessary</i> for forming <br>
perceptual states, even fairly specific categorizations such as those for <i>face</i>. Attention com-<br>
mands, memory, and anticipation provide guidance and feedback, but in perceptual for-<br>
mat. Representing 3-D volume shapes and categorizing objects as bodies or body-parts, by <br>
shape, is initially perceptual.1097 Categorization after 70–150 ms is refined with high-<br>
frequency information, and input from stored perceptual representations of body-shapes, <br>
body-part shapes, and scene-gists. (See Chapter 11, the section Categorization and <br>
Timing.) The templates and other stored representations that figure refined in cat egor iza-<br>
tion derive from perceptual memory and perceptual learning. Categorization in the sys-<br>
tem after 150 ms remains a combination of feed-forward and feedback processing of <br>
entirely perceptual or perceptual-level contents, in perceptual form and perceptual format. <br>
It remains perceptual categorization. Computational operation on these contents remains <br>
within the visual system.<br>
<br>
Most of the authors in the preceding footnote explicitly take the memory-infused pro-<br>
cessing involved in perceptual categorization to be in the visual system. Taking input from <br>
stored perceptual representations as penetrators from the outside—or as cases of know-<br>
ledge that imply an important perception-cognition boundary—has no good the or et-<br>
ic al basis.<br>
<br>
A third use of ‘cognition’ that needs re-evaluation takes cognition to comprise all, or <br>
nearly all, capacities that are not themselves perception. Probably most writing on cogni-<br>
tive penetration accepts the assumption that drives this usage. The capacities discussed in <br>
Chapters 14–18—conation, attention, memory, learning, anticipation, and imagining—<br>
are taken to be cognition. The motivation is sometimes as shallow as ‘if it is not percep-<br>
tion, it must be cognition’.<br>
<br>
On this usage, as in the other two, cognition is distinguished from perception by claim-<br>
ing that what marks cognition is that it is not <i>directly</i> a product of sensory processing. <br>
Cognition is further removed from the “here and now” than perception. This traditional <br>
idea sounds good. I believe that a refinement of the idea does figure in a more nuanced <br>
account of what relevant “removal” consists in. However, the idea cannot, in unqualified <br>
form, guide drawing a significant distinction between perception and cognition.<br>
<br>
Here is an explication of ‘cognition’ that follows the third usage. Petra Vetter and Albert <br>
