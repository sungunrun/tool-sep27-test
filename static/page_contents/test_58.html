Some have claimed that there are perceptual constancies in olfaction.50 These claims <br>
may turn out correct. I am somewhat sceptical. The claims are strongly disputed.51 At the <br>
very least, olfaction is not <i>prominently</i> perceptual, even if it has perceptual aspects. <br>
Nothing central in my account hinges on whether taste and olfaction are perceptual, or <br>
instead non-perceptual sensory capacities. In either case, they are certainly complex and <br>
interesting.<br>
<br>
Let us return to relations between perceptual constancies and objectification. <br>
Objectification is separation of aspects of the proximal stimulus that are adventitious, or <br>
relevant mainly to the stimulus context, and hence special to the individual and occasion, <br>
from aspects that bear specifically on environmental entities, or other subject matter <br>
beyond proximal stimulation. The separation yields a representational state that refers to <br>
particulars and indicates attributes. Perceptual constancies are capacities systematically to <br>
perceptually represent a particular or an attribute as that particular or attribute under a <br>
significant variety of registrations of proximal stimulation. The capacity to represent a given <br>
environmental particular or attribute under various stimulus conditions shows the fruits <br>
of objectification. In a visual perceptual system, an environmental feature can be repre-<br>
sented via various types of proximal stimulation. The different representational state-types <br>
in a constancy, however, retain the perceptual effects of the different types of stimuli. They <br>
are different kinds of perceptual state and use different modes of presentation. They have <br>
different psychological properties, such as formation speed. Hence they have different <br><br>

journal.pone.0129387. Localization by homing alone, which is how olfaction often guides navigation, is a sign <br>
that perceptual location constancy is not in play. The explanation of localization centers on the location and <br>
intensity of proximal stimulation on bodily sensors. Of course, location constancy is not the only perceptual <br>
constancy that olfaction might have. I think that at least some of the invariants touted as perceptual constancies <br>
in olfaction are non-perceptual invariants. For a recent critique of claims of perceptual constancy in olfaction, <br>

Barwich thinks that olfaction should ground revision of the traditional conception of perception as objectively <br>
representing a subject matter, and as constitutively involving perceptual constancies. She takes this conception to <br>
derive from over-focus on vision. I do not accept this recommendation. I think that if olfaction and taste turn <br>
out to lack perceptual constancies and to take the broad form that she thinks current science takes them to have, <br>
they are sufficiently different sensory kinds to count as non-perceptual. The kind <i>perceptual representation as of a <br>
subject matter</i> is a kind that grounds deep scientific causal explanations. It is a kind of enormous interest in itself. <br>
It is long associated with perception. Barwich is entirely correct in emphasizing that ‘the variability in perceptual <br>
responses is not necessarily an expression of subjectivity’. The processes are grounded in capacities that function <br>
to guide individuals through the objective environment. If they do not represent the environment, in my sense of <br>
‘represent’ (and are not perceptual in my sense, and lack objectification), they are neither objective nor subjective <br>
<i>representationally</i>. Their sensory biological <i>functions</i> are grounded objectively. They were molded by interaction <br>
with the objective environment for biological success. I also think Barwich right to emphasize that there are <br>
“categories” of types of smells that are grouped, mainly through learning, and that serve to guide behavior. I <br>
doubt, however, whether these are perceptual groupings.</div>
