of perceptual attributives. Thus, they preserve the modes of presentation and indicants of <br>
the perceptual attributives, (a) and (b), and function to do so in a propositional network <br>
(c). To be the representational content of a <i>perceptual belief</i>, the content must meet a fur-<br>
ther condition. It must <i>also</i> contain referential applications that are counterparts of <i>all</i> the <br>
referential applications in the perceptual state’s content that apply the perceptual at tribu-<br>
tives that are conceptualized in the belief. To be a counterpart, a referential application in <br>
the belief must depend essentially, anaphorically, on the underlying referential applica-<br>
tions in the perceptual state. So the attributives in a perceptual belief are all conceptualiza-<br>
tions of perceptual attributives that occur in the perception from which the belief is <br>
formed. And referential applications guided by those conceptual attributives must have <br>
referential-application counterparts that depend on the referential applications guided by <br>
the perceptual attributives that get conceptualized. Thus the conceptualizing attributive <br>
cubical guides a (conceptual) referential application that functions to refer to the trope <br>
<i>cubical</i> and that depends for doing so entirely on the antecedent perceptual referential <br>
application that occurred in the perceptual state and was guided by the perceptual at tribu-<br>
tive cubical. So a perceptual belief, in my strict sense, retains, anaphorically, connections to <br>
all the <i>de re</i> referential applications that occur in the aspects of the perceptual state from <br>
which the perceptual belief derives. (The referential applications in beliefs are strictly dif-<br>
ferent from those in perception, but the dependence for reference on the perceptual repre-<br>
sentation is total.)<br>
<br>
In understanding memory files and most cases of tracking, the requirement of ana-<br>
phoric referential applications in remembered perceptual states and the referential appli-<br>
cation that dominates the file can be relaxed, even when a file’s referent and that of the <br>
remembered perceptual states are the same. Tracking via memory files does not depend <br>
on strict anaphora. Different perceptions with different referential applications can feed a <br>
memory file, if the perceptions and the file <i>function</i> to track one particular. The memory <br>
file maintains a single referent if all or most referential applications in perceptual states <br>
that feed the file in fact have a single referent, even though co-reference is not guaranteed <br>
by anaphora. Perceptual belief can be understood, in a slightly relaxed way, to allow for <br>
either anaphoric or fallible tracking connections.<br>
<br>
It is very important in thinking about perceptual belief to remember that perceptual <br>
attributives occur in perception at various levels of abstraction. (See Chapter 4, the section <br>
Taxonomic Hierarchies in Perception.) Perceptual beliefs can conceptualize <br>
various corresponding levels of abstraction. One can simultaneously form and hold vari-<br>
ous perceptual beliefs at different levels of perceptual abstraction. One should not think <br>
that perceptual beliefs (or perceptual states) represent <i>only</i> at the most concrete levels.<br>

The formalization of a perceptual belief that body is cubical, where cubical is under-<br>
stood to function to betoken (<i>de re</i>) an instance of <i>cubical</i>, is as follows:<br><br>
(A) cubical(c)[(that x1)((that x2)(cubical(i)(x2), body(i)(x1))].<br><br>
Here ‘that x2’ functions to apply not to a body, as that x1 does, but to an instance of the <br>
shape <i>cubical</i>. It functions <i>de re</i> to pick out the instance of <i>cubical</i> that the perceptual <br>
attributive cubical(i) betokens. The occurrence of the main-verb-phrase-like attributive <br>
cubicalc attributes this trope instance of <i>cubical</i>, as well as the property-type <i>cubical</i>, to the </div>
