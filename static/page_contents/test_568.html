568 Perceptual Memory: Short-Term Systems</div>
<br><br>
Few psychologists would call associative learning in sensory systems or perceptual <br>
learning ‘induction’ or ‘acquisition of knowledge’. Psychologists commonly recognize vari-<br>
ous levels of learning—some very low-level, others involving propositional inference. <br>
A similar circumspection is less common in scientific discourse about memory. Although <br>
counting memory <i>knowledge</i> is common, such usage is not given theoretical weight. Its <br>
prevalence serves, however, to obscure importantly different psychological kinds. <br>
Scientists should do better.<br>
<br>
Knowledge is not just any retained representational information.808 It involves belief—a <br>
propositional attitude. The belief must be true and epistemically warranted. Perhaps it is <br>
fruitful to extend the term ‘knowledge’ to competence with grammatical structures—“tacit <br>
knowledge”. But visual perceptual memory retains perceptual representation. Perception—<br>
even accurate perception—is not knowledge. Perceptual memory, understood as a cap-<br>
acity to retain representations with the content and format of perception, is not knowledge. <br>
Since what is retained (perceptual representation) is not knowledge, the retention of it is <br>
not, and should not be called, knowledge. Perceptual memory is a perceptual-level repre-<br>
sentational capacity.<br>
<br>
There is substantial specific evidence that various types of memory retain perceptual <br>
representation. Some of the evidence is neural. Memory retrieval re-excites parts of the <br>
brain known to be specialized for perception that were originally stimulated by a proximal <br>
stimulus. During memory retrieval, there is reactivation of modality-specific networks <br>
(for example, visual or auditory networks) that were activated during an initial stimulus.809 <br>
The reactivation of late visual areas during memory retrieval appears to occur in ways that <br>
line up with original visual perceptual categories, feature attributions, and spatial <br>
mappings.810<br>
<br>
Representational contents in perceptual memory have the same iconic, non-<br>
propositional content that perception does. Perceptual memory filters or omits some of <br>
the richness of perceptual content. But when it functions well, representationally, it retains <br>
content from perceptual states. Some retention is especially straightforward. What is called <br>
‘iconic visual memory’ retains perceptual contents in after-image form. More advanced <br><br>
