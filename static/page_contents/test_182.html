182  Form and Semantics of Perceptual Contents</div>

effect changes in perceptual state—in the basic psychological kind that the state instanti-<br>
ates. Such changes are changes in representational content. If what is seen and what is <br>
attributed need not change, the different representational contents can be accurate under <br>
the same environmental condition.<br>
<br>
Commonly, shifts in attention do involve some change in the conditions that would <br>
make the resulting perceptual state accurate. At very fine-grained levels of representation, <br>
different attributes are usually indicated; different particulars are perceived. Even when <br>
the environmental conditions that would make the state accurate do not change, one or <br>
more attributive is usually replaced by another attributive that indicates and attributes the <br>
same property or relation. As I indicated, I think it in principle possible that there be a <br>
change in attention, but no change in the referential applications or attributives. Whether <br>
or not I am right about this, changes in what is most highlighted in a perception that are <br>
produced by changes in attention will be marked in the perceptual content. For perceptual <br>
content is a psychological kind, and differences in attention yield psychological kinds with <br>
different properties. For example, a psychological state in which attention is directed to <br>
one aspect of a scene is likely to engender faster action in response to that aspect than a <br>
psychological state in which attention is directed to some other aspect. Differences in <br>
attention are, I think, well understood partly as differences in the scopes of referential <br>
applications.<br>
<br>
Modern logic focuses on conditions for deductive validity in propositional inference. <br>
As I said, differences in scope that do not affect what makes a proposition true are often <br>
regarded as notational differences, or differences relevant only to formal proof, not to <br>
“meaning” or “content”. For purposes of establishing the form of perceptual representa-<br>
tion, worldly conditions that make a perceptual content accurate are not all that matters. <br>
Since representational contents are psychological kinds, they not only set truth conditions, <br>
they reflect psychological differences.<br>
<br>
These points bear a distant kinship to traditional views of grammar that were concerned <br>
with the parts of sentences that constitute their main topic of interest.187 ‘The man walked <br>
around that tree’ and ‘That tree was walked around by the man’ are made true by the same <br>
conditions in the world. Both have noun phrases that, respectively, pick out the same two <br>
objects, and the same properties and relations are attributed in the two sentences. In the <br>
first sentence, the man is the main topic of interest. That fact is marked by making the <br>
noun phrase that refers to the man the subject of the sentence. The second sentence ren-<br>
ders the tree contextually primary.<br>
<br>
I believe that the heavy bias in language toward taking the first-uttered occurrence of a <br>
determiner to have wider scope than other occurrences is a product of the fact that in the <br>
utterance of sentences, attention plays a large role in understanding. What is mentioned <br>
first is attended to first. Attention commonly confers psychological priority. The form <br>
and representational content of perception is likewise sensitive to such factors as focus <br>
of attention.<br>
<br>
This generalization may require qualification for very brief, fast-formed perceptual <br>
states. See Chapters 10–11. Perception that extends through visual search and other scan-<br>
ning operations involves shifts of attention and memory. In the fastest formed perception, <br><br>
