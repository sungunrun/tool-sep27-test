ac cur ate or not. Entities represented by those state-kinds are what make the contents <br>
 accurate or inaccurate. The computational processes studied in perceptual psychology oper-<br>
ate on the representations, or instances of representational contents, not on the entities that <br>
are perceptually represented. So in this respect, also, minimalism has some plausibility.<br>
<br>
Nevertheless, minimalism is mistaken. One class of difficulties centers on the fact that <br>
some law-like psychological differences in representational psychological states within <br>
perceptual constancies do not depend on different complexes of attributives.<br>
<br>
A mechanism for producing a perceptual constancy for depth relations among different <br>
elements in a scene depends on patterns and degrees of defocus in different parts of the <br>
visual field.208 No perceptual attributives represent focus <i>per se</i>. Defocus is not attributed <br>
to anything perceived. Defocus is a property of the visual apparatus. It results from the fact <br>
that a lens can best focus light from only one distance at any given time. It is an aspect of <br>
<i>how</i> the perceived <i>representata</i> are represented. Laws of formation of perceptual states and <br>
perceptual constancies hinge on registered differences in defocus. Defocus information <br>
registration is a cue for some types of representation: depth representation, for example. <br>
Attributives differentiated partly by different degrees of defocus can indicate and attribute <br>
the same attribute in the environment.<br>
<br>
The point about defocus is not limited to representation of depth. Look at a nearby cir-<br>
cle straight on, and foveate it. There is no appreciable blur. Now foveate the circle’s back-<br>
ground. The circle looks more blurred. The blurred and non-blurred states are different <br>
psychological states. The same shape property is represented, and no different distance or <br>
other properties associated with the circle need be represented. There is a difference in <br>
equally accurate psychological states that represent the circle. The states differ in their <br>
modes of presentation and in perhaps the confidence that the perceiver associates with <br>
them, the speed with which they might cause reactions, and so on. The same en vir on-<br>
mental attribute and attribute-instance are represented in different, accurate ways. The <br>
difference does not reduce to representation of other properties besides circular shape.<br>
<br>
Use of defocus is not special to depth relations or to shapes. It figures in segmentation <br>
generally. The degree of focus of a visual presentation varies systematically across the vis-<br>
ual field. Foveal focus is much better than extra-foveal focus, grading off sharply toward <br>
the periphery. Foveal perception of a particular as having an attribute differs in law-like <br>
psychological ways, and in ways that bear on chances of accuracy, from peripheral percep-<br>
tion of the particular as having that attribute. This fact supports taking the representa-<br>
tional contents of perceptual attributives that attribute the constant attribute in perceptual <br>
constancies to differ from one another, while representing a constant property—and not <br>
purely by virtue of representing different properties.<br>
<br>
The points about focus are instances of a larger point. Consider the role of a cue mech-<br>
an ism for perceptually determining a property, where the mechanism is one among many <br>
for determining the property. Consider convergence and binocular disparity. Convergence <br><br>
