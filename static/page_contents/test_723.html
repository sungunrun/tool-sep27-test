What Should Count as Cognition? 723</div>

beliefs in my strict technical sense, have iconic, sensory modal elements. Some non-<br>
propositional iconic states are likely to be amodal and iconic—some navigational mental <br>
maps.1175 Amodality is an abstraction from the functional and phenomenological sensory <br>
specificity of perception. Are amodal states, by virtue of being amodal, supra-perceptual? <br>
Are they cognitive?1176<br>
<br>
Do non-propositional amodal states show a major advance in representational sophisti-<br>
cation over perceptual-level states, by virtue of amodality? I lean negative. Operations <br>
involved in processing some amodal non-propositional states seem not to differ substan-<br>
tially from operations in forming perceptual states. I conjecture that some amodal non-<br>
propositional states are covered by computational explanations that include <br>
perceptual-level states. Then amodality would contrast with perception and modal <br>
perceptual-level states, whereas being in a computational system would contrast with <br>
most or all propositional attitudes. The computational and structural similarity to <br>
perceptual-level modal states would clearly be deeper than the similarity with <i>some</i> prop-<br>
os ition al states in being amodal. Taking amodality to be a mark of the supra-perceptual <br>
risks making a cousin of the empiricist mistake—taking format, qualitative “look”, or level <br>
of abstraction to determine whether a state is perceptual-level. Then lack of imagistic <br>
qualities or abstraction from sensory modality would be taken to determine a higher-or <br>
cognitive level of representation. Amodal <i>map-like</i> states function to pick out particulars <br>
by characterizing them. They are functionally and structurally like perceptual-level states. <br>
I know of no reason to think that operations that produce amodal states are always more <br>
knowledge-like than perceptual operations. Although amodality may perhaps be termed <br>
supra-perceptual, I doubt that it should count—in itself—as cognitive. Obviously, these are <br>
topics for further reflection.<br>
<br>
I think it better here to reflect on more basic aspects of psychological representational <br>
competencies than amodality in trying to distinguish cognition from perceptual-level rep-<br>
resentation. Key factors are types of attributives and especially types of operations. With <br>
no suggestion of completeness, I sketch, very briefly, some ways of thinking that might be <br>
fruitful.<br>
<br>
There are certainly no perceptual attributives that apply to particulars that cannot be <br>
perceived (quarks or beliefs, for example). In the previous section, I discussed cases of <br>
perceivable but unperceived particulars that can be remembered or anticipated at the per-<br>
ceptual level. One could perceive an effect and perceptually anticipate a (perceivable) <br>
cause that is not currently perceived. Infants anticipate finding causal agents behind occlu-<br>
sions after seeing typical effects of the agent. On the other hand, not just any causal rela-<br>
tion between perceivable, but unperceived, causes or effects can be attributed at the <br>
perceptual level. Suppose an individual who has a perceptual attributive for causation and <br>
can see events of smoking cigarettes and does perceive some dyings that are in fact caused <br><br>

<b>FOOTNOTES</b><br>
<b>FN</b>1175 Iconic format can be modal or amodal, conceptual or perceptual-level. If a natural, psychological state is <br>
perceptual-level, it is iconic. Conceptual states can be iconic or not, also modal or not.<br>

<b>FN</b>1176 In Burge, ‘Reply to Block: Adaptation and the Upper Border of Perception’, I took ‘supra-perceptual’ and <br>
‘cognitive’ to be approximately equivalent. However, ‘cognitive’ implies being broadly knowledge-like, whereas <br>
‘supra-perceptual’ is silent. So there is room for a distinction, but I do not yet draw one. In that article, I applied <br>
both terms to non-propositional amodal states. I have come to doubt that amodality is a mark of being either <br>
supra-perceptual or cognitive. I doubt that amodality in itself is a <i>deep</i> advance in representational sophistication <br>
or level. These issues need exploration.</div>
