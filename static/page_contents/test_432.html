432 Intra-Saccadic Perception and Recurrent Processing</div>

relation of neuro-scientific work to psychological explanation, timings that I have set <br>
out—for neural patterns putatively underlying both spatial constancies and cat egor iza tions—<br>
only strongly suggest timings of psychological counterparts. I think the apparent facts <br>
remain interesting.<br>
<br>
As a rough rule, perceptual constancies become stronger in two respects at greater <br>
latencies from stimulus onset. First, correlations between neural firings and distal (as con-<br>
trasted with proximal) stimuli become better, and accuracy of attribution to distal stimuli <br>
despite differences in proximal stimulation increases. Second, tolerance of a wider range <br>
of variations in proximal stimulus improves—both for neural-environmental correlations <br>
and for accuracy of attribution. For example, earliest-formed states are tolerant of less dra-<br>
matic rotations than later-formed states are. This rule applies both in the initial formation <br>
of spatial and categorizational perceptual attributives and between the stage at which ini-<br>
tial categorization is formed and the stage at which that initial formation is reinforced by <br>
substantial recurrent processing, which occurs 75–100 ms later.<br>
<br>
Accuracy under position, size, and rotational variations is never very high at the fastest <br>
perception-formation speeds (70–120 ms from stimulus onset in IT). Those levels of <br>
ac cur acy are on the order of 60–70%. Again, this ultra-rapid perception is labeled ‘at-a-glance’. <br>
It is based on low-frequency spatial information. Later-stage processing is supplied <br>
with more recurrent processing—including input from memory and endogenous atten-<br>
tion. At-a-glance perception initiates motor-commands when speed matters more for <br>
survival than accuracy. Such perception is philosophically important, I think, because it is <br>
perception at its fastest-formed and most primitive.</div>
