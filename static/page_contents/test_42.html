Truth in a context applies to sentence-types. This way of doing semantics is convenient <br>
and perspicuous. I think that it is not fundamental. I think that truth, full stop, is basic. <br>
‘Truth in a context’ is a heuristically useful artifice that is not conceptually fundamental. <br>
For demonstrative-and indexical-containing sentences, sentence occurrences are the fun-<br>
damental bearers of truth and falsity. Alternatively, one could take the fundamental bear-<br>
ers to be hybrids of occurrent uses of context-dependent devises combined with standing <br>
abstract repeatables. Although users of language and perceivers do not have separate sym-<br>
bols for occurrences or uses and for words they are occurrences or uses of, a fundamental <br>
semantics for <i>language</i> needs some symbolic way of distinguishing the two, as I have done <br>
by distinguishing that from its subscripts.<br>
<br>
The conception of even repeatable representational contents in perception as symbols is <br>
misleading, in that it overplays similarities between perception and language. Even the <br>
schematic content is not to be thought of as having a corresponding symbol in a percep-<br>
tual system. I symbolize the content with a demonstrative symbol ‘that’. But a perceptual <br>
system just harbors a repeatable competence to pick out particulars. That competence is a <br>
representational content that the demonstrative ‘that’ stands in for.<br>
<br>
Philosophers should avoid falling into wooden ways of thinking about relations <br>
between representational contents or representations, on one hand, and symbols, on the <br>
other. One should not think of referential schematic elements as literally demonstratives <br>
in perception. One should not think of perceptual referential applications literally as uses <br>
of demonstratives. Rather the schemas are <i>demonstrative­ like</i>. The applications are <i>analogs</i> <br>
of uses of demonstratives. I discuss reasons for caution about thinking of perceptual <br>
representation as symbolic representation in Chapter 4, the section Perception, <br>
Computation, and the Language-of-Thought Hypothesis.<br>
<br>
In any case, referential applications and their schemas are distinct constituents in the <br>
representational contents of perception. The former are exercises of standing competen-<br>
cies. The latter are the competencies. Since there are different types of competence to <br>
engage in referential application, both the competence and the referential application are <br>
needed to constitute representational contents, hence the veridicality conditions, of per-<br>
ception. Another reason for taking schematic contents and referential applications to be <br>
distinct constituents in a perceptual state’s representational content is that sometimes <br>
the schematic content is preserved in another psychological state, while the referential <br>
application lapses. I discuss such cases in Chapter 17, the section Ability-General <br>
Long-Term Perceptual Memory.<br>
<br>
There may be reference in perception to pluralities. If so, there is a schematic compe-<br>
tence marked by those. Such a schematic competence would be a second type, in addition <br>
to the singular referential competence marked by that. It, too, would admit of applications, <br>
which would be marked by subscripts. I think that the singular representations are basic <br>
and dominant in perception. In fact, in perception, I think that any those competence and <br>
application would be made up of that competencies and applications, respectively. So I <br>
write mainly about the latter. There is certainly a plural schematic referential competence <br>
in thought. That competence admits of occurrent referential applications.<br>
<br>
Two other types of schematic competence figure in most perception. These are compe-<br>
tencies to anchor spatial and temporal frameworks. Thus there are schematic contents <br>
ego-here and ego-now that admit of occurrent referential applications. In these cases, the <br>
type of reference is different. It is not a perceptual picking out of anything. It is an </div>
