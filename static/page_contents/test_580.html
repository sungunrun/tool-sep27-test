580 Perceptual Memory: Short-Term Systems</div>
<br><br>
Search routines do not follow the strategy of fixing locations that best match the features <br>
of a search target, as intuition and many search models tend to assume. Rather, human auto-<br>
matic search strategies tend to select fixations that maximize information gained about the <br>
search target’s location. Automatic searches are more location-based than feature-based.849<br>
<br>
The role of TSM in visual search is closely related to a role in guiding attention. Patterns <br>
of psychological guidance include active directed attention in active visual search. Visual <br>
search is governed by a default map. Such a map has weightings that shift attention <br>
en dogen ous ly but automatically in saccades, unless attention is exogenously “grabbed”. <br>
Suppose that some item is seen in the periphery. Suppose that a movement or a pop-out <br>
property grabs attention. The next saccade is frequently directed to the item. In visual <br>
search, perceivers can override the default map—for example, to actively attend to non-<br>
foveal areas. Attention to peripheral items also figures prominently in guiding normal <br>
automatic saccadic eye movement. Nevertheless, attention is naturally drawn to foveated <br>
areas. There is evidence that it is not possible to direct attention to one location and make <br>
an active saccade to an adjacent location. Although attention does not move in lock step <br>
with eye direction, it is closely associated with it.850<br>
<br>
The automatic and unconscious character of most endogenous attention that combines <br>
with trans-saccadic memory to control eye movements in visual searches strongly sug-<br>
gests that the commands that lead to shifts are part of the visual system’s normal function-<br>
ing. Endogenous attention <i>can</i> be controlled by beliefs and intentions. Then, one might <br>
say, it is cognitively driven. However, initiations of endogenous attention that cause sac-<br>
cades tend to be part of the normal functioning of the visual system.<br>
<br>
A third function of TSM is to help guide and control motor action. Hand movements <br>
typically begin before the target of a movement is fixated, in fact, even before the eye <br>
begins to shift direction toward the target. In setting up such hand movements, the cona-<br>
tive system often has only peripheral, low-quality visual information to work from. <br>
Peripheral information about a target’s location, orientation, size, and shape obtained dur-<br>
ing a fixation is retained in TSM, clustered around a memory file, and used to guide hand <br>
movement to the target-object. Memory of peripherally represented properties guides <br>
direction of hand movement and orientation of the hand, to help the agent grasp the <br>
target-object effectively. As in stabilization and search, weight is given to memory of tar-<br>
gets, especially fixated ones, in guiding hand movements.851<br>
<br>
The character of what is retained in TSM has been a source of intense discussion since <br>
the discovery of remapping. Retention of information in retinal coordinates was estab-<br>
lished early on. Information about the retinal map of the visual image was shown to be <br>
retained across saccades. This information is non-perceptual. It is not by itself, or in its <br>
first occurrences, embedded in perceptual constancies. If such information exhausted <br><br>
