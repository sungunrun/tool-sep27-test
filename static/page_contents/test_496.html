496 Perceptual-Level Representation and Categorization</div>

or indispensable to, the computational patterns or explanations. Perception and <br>
perceptual-level states differ from conceptual states in their form. They also differ in causal <br>
patterns that they enter into. Conceptual states do not, or at any rate have not been shown <br>
to, figure in computational causal patterns. So I think that despite some cognitive influ-<br>
ence, perceptual and perceptual-motor systems are psychological natural kinds—distin-<br>
guished by computations and functions at a purely perceptual level.<br>
<br>
Of course, the response to the first misconception figures in this answer to the second. <br>
Conceptual effects on processes in the perceptual system go through perceptual-level <br>
counterparts of the conceptual states, counterparts that represent the same or similar sub-<br>
ject matter with perceptual attributives. The main counterparts are memories, conative <br>
commands, and attention commands. These counterpart <i>perceptual-level</i> states <i>are</i> indis-<br>
pensable to some of the computations. Their antecedent cognitive/conceptual drivers <br>
are not.<br>
<br>
I next discuss two prominent aspects of feedback in perceptual categorization. Various <br>
types of feedback have their effects 135–200+ ms after stimulus onset. Feedback into the <br>
infero-temporal cortex (IT) comes from other temporal areas, and from frontal and par-<br>
ietal areas.660 Both types of feedback that I am about to discuss are prominent in this <br>
time period.<br>
<br>
One type is enhancement of categorization by connection with representations of <br>
scene-gist. (See Chapter 10, Two Types of First-formed Perception.) The other <br>
is enhancement of categorization through connection with memory-stored effects from <br>
antecedent perception of similar instances of categories, of features, or of object-parts. <br>
These stored effects function as cues to enhanced, more specific perceptual categorization. <br>
First-formed categorization does not <i>depend</i> on feedback of either of these kinds. It is, <br>
however, enriched by them.<br>
<br>
First, feedback from representation of scene-gist. Perceptual representation of scene-<br>
gist is initially processed separately from the main ventral sequence that issues in percep-<br>
tual categorization. Signals from the dorsal stream yield low-frequency, sketch-like <br>
perceptual representations of gist, supported in the retrosplenial cortex and para-<br>
hippocampal cortex (PHC), which is in the medial temporal lobe. The retrosplenial cortex <br>
and PHC also feed forward to the orbital frontal cortex (OFC). Perceptual scene-gist rep-<br>
resentations supported in these areas are sketches of ensembles of shaped bodies or sur-<br>
faces in spatial arrangements—types of ensembles that occur in fields, forests, kitchens, <br>
stadiums, and so on. During the sequence just described, the new perceptual representa-<br>
tions of scene-gist are compared with typical types of scene-gist representations stored in <br>
memory. These types of ensembles of shapes derive from association in perceptual learn-<br>
ing. The learned groupings are stored in memory. The memory representations of scene-<br>
gist are perceptual level. At this level, they do not specify biological natural kinds (<i>pig</i>, <br>
<i>zebra</i>) or sophisticated artifacts (probably not <i>book</i>, <i>kitchen</i>, <i>stadium</i>), or sophisticated <br>
activities (<i>reading</i>) as such. The relevant perceptual attributives dominantly indicate <br><br>
