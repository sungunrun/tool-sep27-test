506 Perceptual-Level Conation and Action</div>
<br><br>
The primary types of psychological states in perception-guided action are the following:<br><br>
perceptual states<br>
<br>
perceptual memories<br>
<br>
perceptual anticipations<br>
<br>
affective states<br>
<br>
applications of perceptual attention<br>
<br>
conative (or actional) states<br>
<br>
(which include both target-setting states and motor commands)<br><br>
and<br><br>
efference copy of conative states.<br><br>
All the types occur consciously and unconsciously. All are at the perceptual level of <br>
representation.<br>
<br>
I call action above the level of action that is not guided by a representational state at all, <br>
but below the level of action guided by propositional attitudes, ‘<i>relatively primitive action</i>’. <br>
I focus on this type. As far as is currently known, every organism equipped with percep-<br>
tion has perceptual memory, perceptual anticipation, and target-representing conative <br>
states that representationally set tasks. Perception frames and helps guide action.<br>
<br>
I focus on relatively primitive action by mammals, especially humans. I do so because <br>
more is known about their actional systems than about those of other animals. For humans <br>
and most other mammals, the primary modalities of perception relevant to action are <br>
vision and proprioception. Olfaction plays a huge role in much mammalian action. <br>
Olfaction is not clearly a perceptual sense. So specification of its contributions to action <br>
may not invoke genuinely representational states, as distinct from information registra-<br>
tional states.<br>
<br>
Vision often identifies target-objects for action. Proprioception coordinates with vision <br>
to guide action to a target. For example, in reaching for a piece of fruit, an agent sees the <br>
fruit as a body of a given shape, size, orientation, and location. The hand and its grip are <br>
guided to grasp the fruit. Guidance is proprioceptive as well as visual. The agent and psy-<br>
cho logic al system monitor the hand’s progress. Reach direction and grip size may be <br>
adjusted as hand nears fruit. Adjustment is necessary to correct inexact initial visual per-<br>
ceptions. The individual’s psychological system must also correct for imprecision in initial <br>
reach movements, and for movement of target-object during reaching. Vision and pro-<br>
prio cep tion coordinate in matching reaching and gripping movements to the entities <br>
identified by vision. This coordination is dynamic—capable of adjustment as a reach pro-<br>
ceeds. I describe this coordination in more detail when we have more “actors” on stage.<br>
<br>
Action takes time to prepare and execute. Perceptual representation is retained and <br>
updated as targets are set and action is carried out. For relatively primitive, psy cho logic-<br>
al ly guided action, such retention and updating occurs in one or more forms of short-term <br>
perceptual memory. The main type of memory involved in action that is not prepared over <br>
long stretches is working memory. Some very fast, short-term actions are guided by other <br>
types of short-term memory—visual sensory memory, for example. (See Chapter 16.) <br>
Action representation guided by perception operates on a temporal residue of perception, </div>
