<b>Egocentric Spatial Indexes in Perception<br><br>
</div>
</b>The spatial character of most visual perception has been a theme in preceding chapters. <br>
Spatial organization is obvious in normal mammalian visual, tactile, and proprioceptive <br>
perception. It is less salient, but still important, in human auditory perception. In this sec-<br>
tion, I say more about the structure of visual spatial representation. As always, I assume <br>
the distinction between information registration and perceptual representation.<br>
<br>
The 2-D layout of retinal registration of light arrays is a starting point for all visual pro-<br>
cessing. There are deep formal, geometrical, or topological connections among (a) the <br>
arrangement of neural receptors in the retina, (b) 2-D information registration of the ret-<br>
inal image by those receptors, (c) the format of subsequent pre-perceptual filterings of <br>
spatially relevant information, and (d) formats of visual perceptual states. I discuss these <br>
facts, citing empirical evidence, in Chapter 9, the section Iconic Aspects of <br>
Perceptual Spatial Representation. Here I assume them.<br>
<br>
I also assume that physical space is not represented—as distinguished from informa-<br>
tionally registered—either in retinal registrations or in several subsequent stages of pro-<br>
cessing those initial registrations. (See Chapter 3, the section Visual Spatial <br>
Property and Relation Constancies.) I assume eventual conversion, through <br>
visual processing, of retinal information registration into a framework, with map-like for-<br>
mat, for <i>perceptually representing</i> particulars in 3-D space.238<br>
<br>
Both in this section on spatial representation and the subsequent section on temporal <br>
representation, I understand ‘framework’ in a liberal way. Some perceptual frameworks <br>
map local space or time fairly extensively, though probably all such frameworks have <br>
aspects of indeterminacy regarding spatial or temporal magnitudes. Probably all some-<br>
times represent ordinal depth or temporal order without specifying definite distances <br>
or definite durations. Perceptual spatial or temporal frameworks can be as simple as <br><br>
