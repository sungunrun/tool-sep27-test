between any competing theories. Quine concluded that questions about sameness of <br>
meaning have no objective answers.1048 At times in his career, he rejected not only the <br>
notion of meaning, but also the notion of belief. This rejection rested partly on his behav-<br>
iorism and partly on his view that the contents of beliefs would have to be meanings of <br>
sentences. He thought that meanings are a figment of bad linguistic theory.<br>
<br>
Most philosophers directly influenced by Quine did not drive the holist theory of <br>
meaning to Quine’s sceptical conclusions about meaning or belief. They assumed that <br>
some inferences counted more than others in determining meaning. However, they <br>
thought that sciences that differ in their <i>basic</i> inferences share too little meaning to engage <br>
in inquiry that could lead to objectively favoring one over the other. Several philosophers <br>
interested in the nature of science concluded that science’s purported objectivity is ser-<br>
ious ly compromised even by their less radical versions of meaning holism. To his credit, <br>
Quine never doubted the objectivity of science.<br>
<br>
Famously, Thomas Kuhn held that radically different scientific theories—theories that <br>
differ in basic principles and inferences, such as those of Newton and Einstein—are <i>incom-<br>
mensurable</i>: No objective considerations could decide between them. Such theories could <br>
not share enough meaning to conflict. So differences between theories that differ in basic <br>
ways could not be adjudicated by appeal to observation. On the Kuhnian view, all scien-<br>
tific beliefs depend for their identity on their place in inference. If theoretical premises <br>
and inferences differ sufficiently, neither scientific meanings nor scientific beliefs could be <br>
objectively adjudicated.1049<br>
<br>
Most philosophers’ concerns about the objectivity of science were driven by Quinean <br>
views about meaning or by Kuhn’s view about the history of science. However, some <br>
appealed, in an anecdotal way, to New Look psychology. They took this movement to sug-<br>
gest that perception itself is inevitably colored by theory. So they took psychology to bol-<br>
ster the idea that there is no objective, observational basis for scientific claims.1050<br>
<br>
In the 1970s Quinean and Kuhnian bases for doubting scientific objectivity unraveled.<br>
<br>
Quine’s views on meaning lost influence in the face of developments in philosophy of <br>
language, philosophy of mind, and linguistics. The view that meaning is a function of <br>
inferential role first came under pressure from philosophical work on reference. Reference <br>
to a given entity was shown to occur despite large differences in background beliefs and <br>
inferences, and even in the absence of any significant background information about the <br>
referent. Causal and other relations to a subject matter anchor reference. The point applied <br><br>

Churchland was mainly influenced by Quinean theory of meaning. Churchland claims, clearly referring to the <br>

ordinary lay people, do not see the sky as redder as the sun sets, but rather observe the wavelength distribution of <br>
solar radiation as shifting towards longer wavelengths (30). One can only shake one’s head in wonder.</div>
