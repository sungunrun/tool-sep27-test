surfaces) to <i>S</i>. <i>S</i> is, of course, seen and seen as a surface. So a perceptual state applies sur-<br>
face to it as well. Indeed, application of the attributive to the parts is surely a consequence <br>
of application of the attributive to the whole. If <i>S</i> is perceived, the attributive surface is <br>
accurate not only of <i>S</i>, but of perceived surface-parts of <i>S</i>. Since the sub-parts that are <br>
perceived are different from one another and are perceptually distinguished, different <br>
attributives are applied to them (by (AA1a) of Chapter 5). So there are further attributives <br>
applied to each of them besides the attributives surface and part of (relating each sub-part <br>
to <i>S</i>). These further attributives represent the sub-parts’ spatial locations relative to one <br>
another and relative to <i>S</i>. Attributions of these locational attributives are part of the appli-<br>
cation of the iconic spatial framework that is anchored at the position of the perceiver. So <br>
all the parts are attributed directions and either distances or ordinal depths, relative to the <br>
perceiver, except in cases in which the spatial framework goes non-committal or indeter-<br>
minate. These relational spatial attributions are (and must be) be different for each differ-<br>
ent, perceptually distinguished, sub-part of <i>S</i>. Several are applied by each referential <br>
application. That is, at least surface, part of (that1 surface), and a locational attributive in <br>
the egocentrically anchored spatial framework, are applied to each perceived sub-part of <br>
<i>S</i>. These attributives are all attributed iconically. They apply partly by virtue of attributives’ <br>
taking the format of positions in a representational grid. Part-of attributives will also apply <br>
between smaller and larger perceived sub-parts of S, when smaller ones are perceived as <br>
parts of larger ones. And many other attributives—for color, for example—are applied to <br>
each perceived sub-part of <i>S</i> as well.<br>
<br>
These reflections imply that a colossal number of referential applications and attribu-<br>
tional applications occur when edges, surfaces, or bodies and their perceptually dis crim-<br>
in able sub-parts are seen. In most perceptual states, there are billions of referential <br>
applications, connected to referents by distinct causal chains. A referential application <br>
applies attributives to each perceived sub-part. These huge numbers reflect distinct exer-<br>
cises of perceptual capacities.<br>
<br>
Of course, the referential and attributional applications are not acts. They do not occur <br>
sequentially. They are events, or occurrent aspects of an occurrent-state-instance. They are <br>
exercised as a group. The referential applications differ because their semantical roles <br>
 differ—they mark different seeings of different things. The referential applications are <br>
exercises of different perceptual competencies. Attributives are specific competencies. <br>
Referential applications are attributional applications, hence exercises of different compe-<br>
tencies. Articulating the different referential events is a way of bringing out how much <br>
specific, differentiating spatial information is present in a visual perception. Each of these <br>
events, or occurrent aspects of the largest event—the perceptual state’s occurrence—bears <br>
different causal relations to the environment. Each is situated differently in an iconic spa-<br>
tial mapping of the different sub-parts. Each falls into psychological laws that govern the <br>
production (from proximal stimuli) of an exercise of a specific perceptual competence, <br>
where each exercise is marked by a referential application, applying one or more attribu-<br>
tive competencies. These are competencies to represent surfaces and surface-parts plotted <br>
in different positions in the framework. These exercises result from a triggering of a <br>
dispos itional competence by a train of psychological events initiated by proximal <br>
stimulation.<br>
<br>
The colossal number of perceptual events—or occurrent aspects of the main event—is <br>
certainly not too large for the number of neural events underlying any given perceptual </div>
