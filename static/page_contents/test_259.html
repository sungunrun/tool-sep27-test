Egocentric Spatial Indexes in Perception 259</div>
<br><br>
I am not sure how to understand certain limitations on the depth of spaces that are <br>
perceptually represented. The sky is a background for much of our perception of particu-<br>
lars. How deeply into the sky do our perceptual spatial representational frameworks <br>
extend? We see objects—say, stars—as where in the direction that they were, at the time <br>
they caused the light that reaches us, and at some depth in relation to us. We do not see <br>
them <i>as</i> being at their actual distances. We learn how far they are by learning astronomy. <br>
In human vision, approximate accuracy regarding ordinal depth and distance drops off <br>
precipitously after a hundred yards or so. I conjecture that, in such cases, the visual system <br>
starts toward being non-committal about distance. When it is dealing with the distance of <br>
stars, it probably has too few reliable cues to be committal at all. Far away backgrounds, <br>
like the color expanse of the sky, are represented as having ordinal depth. It is represented <br>
as farther than surfaces that it forms a background for.<br>
<br>
There is a general lack of committal-ness about distance, outside ranges for which the <br>
visual system has adequate cues to make correct metrical distance attributions. These <br>
ranges vary with species, context, and environmental conditions. What seems fairly clear <br>
is that even though we can see some entities that are at enormous distances, they are not <br>
placed at such distances in the spatial frameworks of unaided perception. Perceptual sys-<br>
tems have no good way of getting right their distances, or locations, even approximately.<br>
<br>
Similarly, the very smallest spatial scales are not represented in perception. Perhaps <br>
only the smallest spatial grain that could encompass a particular that could be discerned <br>
as a unit by perception is perceptually represented.<br>
<br>
So perceptual representation of space is partial and local. It always exhibits some <i>system</i>, <br>
however. When a location is represented, it is situated in relation to the perceiver and <br>
other positions in space—positions intermediate between perceiver and perceived, differ-<br>
ent positions on a perceived entity, triangles of positions between two perceived particu-<br>
lars (or two parts of a particular) and the perceiver. The term ‘framework’ alludes to this <br>
systematicity.<br>
<br>
The egocentric character of spatial representational frameworks in perception derives <br>
from the fact that all perception is from the point of view, or perspective—here, the pos-<br>
ition—of the perceiver. In this respect, the most basic spatial representation in perception <br>
contrasts with spatial representation by a roadmap, and with the longitude/latitude grid <br>
on the earth. The origins or anchor points of these latter representations of space are inde-<br>
pendent of any one individual. Such spatial representations are allocentric.<br>
<br>
An egocentric representational framework is a special case of a <i>representer-centered <br>
 representational framework</i>. Spatial, temporal, and other framework representations <br>
 represent relevant relations with respect to an anchor or origin. A system of Cartesian <br>
coordinates, for example, might have two dimensions on <i>x</i> and <i>y</i> axes. The center of the <br>
coordinate system, usually labeled ‘(0,0)’, is the origin. A 3-D spatial representational <br>
framework also establishes an origin—the position in space with respect to which all other <br>
positions are oriented. A <i>representer-centered</i> representational framework is a representa-<br>
tional framework in which the origin is associated with the representer.248 For spatial <br>
frameworks, the origin is roughly where the viewer is, or where some part of the viewer is. <br><br>

<b>FOOTNOTES</b><br>
<b>Cont FN</b>248 I use ‘representer-centered’ even though ‘viewer-centered’ is more common. I take the term to apply to <br>
hearers’ spatial frameworks whose represented origins are at the position on or at the hearer. I take it to apply to <br>
non-spatial frameworks. I take the term to apply to representers that need not be operating as perceivers. They <br>
may be operating as agents or thinkers.</div>
