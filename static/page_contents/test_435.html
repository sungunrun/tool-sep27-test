Methodology for Finding Perceptual Attributives 435</div>

to make progress toward determining whether attributives for a given attribute are per-<br>
ceptual—produced by a perceptual system.<br>
<br>
Another branch of this unfortunate current in philosophy fashions armchair accounts <br>
of perception to fit antecedent views in epistemology. Few modern philosophical views are <br>
more backwards. The view drives a lot of philosophical work.551 Epistemic norms are <br>
standards for processing information and forming beliefs in a way that is conducive to <br>
representing the world knowledgeably. In the absence of an antecedent understanding of <br>
relevant information-processing and belief-formation capabilities, accounts of norms risk <br>
irrelevance to actual belief formation. Epistemology should build on psychology. <br>
Psychology is not constrained by epistemology. Specifying psychological capabilities to fit <br>
an antecedent conception of epistemology—for example, epistemology as confined to <br>
norms for reasons and reasoning—amounts to falling into two of philosophy’s very worst <br>
mistakes. These are the mistakes of dictating to science, and the mistake of constructing <br>
unscientific accounts of aspects of the world that science has a lot to say about.<br>
<br>
Philosophy should build its normative theories so as to be at least compatible with what <br>
is scientifically known. In the case of epistemology, the relevant facts include psy cho logic al <br>
facts—specifically, facts known in perceptual psychology.<br>
<br>
Issues over whether a candidate attributive is a perceptual attributive cannot be settled <br>
by armchair methods. Neither introspection nor reflection on epistemic norms is a reliable <br>
method for determining where, in the order of processing, attributives for a given at tri-<br>
bute originate.<br>
<br>
There are also trends in <i>psychology</i> that regard perception-formation as infused with <br>
“concepts” and biased by background beliefs and values. Contrary to mainstream percep-<br>
tual psychology, these trends take perceptual representation to involve or depend on high-<br>
level attributives. Many such claims are mistaken or wildly inflated. Much of this work <br>
comes from social psychologists who are not rigorously trained in perceptual psychology. <br>

<b>FOOTNOTES</b><br>
<b>Cont FN</b>Such a defense would not fit the way the material is presented. It is presented as an attempt to understand percep-<br>
tion. I have heard philosophers claim that because it focuses on <i>conscious</i> experience and perceptual psychology <br>
focuses on perceptual states, it is immune to scientific test, for science is not about conscious perception. This claim <br>
is no better. The science is about perceptual state formation, and perceptual states are often conscious. So claims <br>
about what in phenomenal experience is perceptual and what is conceptual are subject to scientific determination. <br>
Several of the intuitive claims issuing from armchair methods are not correct. The main issue, however, is that the <br>
methodology cannot give one psy cho logic al natural kinds. There are too many better ways to find natural bound ar-<br>
ies of perception, even conscious perception. I single out Siegel’s traditional empiricist approach, because its meth-<br>
odology is explicit and has had some influence. For more discussion of phenomenological approaches, see <br>
Chapter 19, the section Framework Issues. Other examples of philosophizing about perception without ser-<br>
ious use of science are McDowell, ‘The Content of Perceptual Experience’; Schellenberg, ‘Perceptual Particularity’.<br>
<br>
551 An example is Sellars, ‘Empiricism and the Philosophy of Mind’. J. McDowell, <i>Mind and World</i> (Cambridge, <br>
MA: Harvard University Press, 1994) followed Sellars. Both maintained that for perception to serve epistemol-<br>
ogy, it has to contain concepts and to have propositional form. McDowell was, and early Sellars may have been, <br>
influenced by a common misreading of Kant’s <i>Critique of Pure Reason</i>. I think that Kant did <i>not</i> make such <br>
claims about perception <i>per se</i>. In that book, he discussed relations between perception and thought only insofar <br>
as individuals used them in having cognition (<i>Erkenntnis</i>)—<i>very</i> roughly, scientific knowledge. I hope to discuss <br>
this historical matter in detail elsewhere. Later Sellars produces a less wayward view of Kant on perception: see <br>
W. Sellars, <i>Science and Metaphysics: Variations on Kantian Themes</i> (London: Routledge & Kegan Paul,1968; <br>
re issued Atascadero, CA: Ridgeview Publishing Co., 1992). At the time he wrote ‘Empiricism and the Philosophy <br>
of Mind’ (1956), Sellars was probably also influenced by a prominent trend in psychology at the time—New Look <br>
Psychology. I discuss this trend in Chapter 19, the section The Original Epistemic Grounds for <br>
Reflecting on Cognitive Influence on Perception. I discuss Sellars’s work and McDowell’s work <br>
in Burge, ‘Perceptual Entitlement’; Burge, ‘Disjunctivism and Perceptual Psychology’; Burge, ‘Disjunctivism <br>
Again’; and Burge, <i>Origins of Objectivity</i>, chapters 5–6 and 369n, 430n, 433–435.</div>
