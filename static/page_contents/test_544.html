544 Perceptual Attention</div>
<br><br>
A general way should not be expected. The problem must be tackled empirically on a <br>
case by case basis. The examples of the effect of covert exogenous spatial attention on tem-<br>
poral representation are cases in point. Whether a perceptual state represents two flashes <br>
or one, or a rectangle as going up or down, is not a matter of scale or degree. Here, there is <br>
no special difficulty in determining whether a perceptual state is accurate or not. It is <br>
straightforward, here, that attention degrades accuracy. Known causes of these types of <br>
inaccuracy might be applicable to help determine how to interpret inaccuracies of scalar <br>
properties.766<br>
<br>
There are many other “anchor” representations of non-scalar attributes for which a <br>
problem of exactly what a scalar representation represents does not arise. Representation <br>
of one surface as closer than another, and representation of a surface as fronto-parallel or <br>
not, are examples. One can use scalar representations that deal with cases very close to an <br>
anchor to gain an empirical grip on exact scalar estimation. For example, one can test for a <br>
representation of the smallest discriminable distance of one surface as being farther away <br>
from another. Then one could project larger differences starting defeasibly with multiples <br>
of smallest discriminable units.<br>
<br>
Sometimes degradation in non-scalar accuracy helps explain failures of scalar accuracy. <br>
In shifting focus to a new position, thereby increasing spatial resolution at that position, <br>
attention can mis-locate an object, because the spatial coding that was in place before the <br>
attention shift does not shift as fast as the change in the receptive fields of neurons that <br>
yield a different spatial representation. Such effects help explain scalar distortions of size <br>
with attention shifts.767<br>
<br>
Degradation in accuracy in the temporal, non-scalar cases is always associated with <br>
enhancement of another property of representation <i>in addition to</i> accuracy, such as spatial <br>
discriminability or spatial resolution. Often that other property is associated with either <br>
enhancement or degradation in accuracy. For example, greater spatial resolution often can <br>
be found to improve accuracy. Greater discriminability can correlate with degradation of <br>
accuracy. Exaggerating the distance between two boundaries can facilitate distinguishing <br>
the bounded items.<br>
<br>
By recording sources of enhancement and degradation of accuracy, one can test for <br>
maximal absence of those sources, and home in on conditions in which a capacity yields <br>
exactly or optimally accurate representations, subject to limitations of noise and acuity. <br>
Given the richness of considerations already in play, resourceful experimentation is <br>
already determining under what conditions a perceptual system produces maximally <br>
accurate representations.<br>
<br>
The general points are these. First, there is no apriori reason to be afraid of finding most <br>
perceptual states, at least those that represent scalar properties, to be slightly inaccurate—<br>
just approximately accurate. Second, there is no apriori reason to think that one cannot <br>
find conditions under which a perceptual system produces exactly or, for the system opti-<br>
mally, accurate scalar estimates. Third, it is best to follow science’s assessment of ac cur acy <br><br>
