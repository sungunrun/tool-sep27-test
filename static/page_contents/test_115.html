In fact, it is completely unclear why interposing a syntactic layer between the clearly physical <br>
neural patterns and events and the clearly representational patterns and events helps with <br>
the mind–body problem.<br>
<br>
The laws that perceptual psychology specifies include causal relations involving content-<br>
ful psychological states. The laws connect different representational states with one another, <br>
and non-representational states, such as stimulus input or behavioral output, with represen-<br>
tational states. There is nothing spooky or puzzling about the causal relations specified in <br>
the science. Attempts to reinterpret scientific accounts as <i>really</i> being about causal relations <br>
specified as being purely among neural states or “syntactic” states, falsifies the science. There <br>
certainly <i>are</i> causal relations among the underlying neural states. But taking the psychological <br>
laws to be <i>really</i> laws among items that are not contentful, both falsifies the science and <br>
presents an exceptionally simple-minded “solution” to the mind–body problem.119<br>
<br>
None of this is to say that there are no philosophically interesting issues here. We do not <br>
understand relations between representational psychological states and underlying neural <br>
states very well, other than that there is some dependency relation. The psychological sci-<br>
ence and the neurological science, with their different laws and vocabularies must each be <br>
respected and accepted. The <i>exact</i> nature of the relations between psychological and neur al <br>
states, events, and properties is not a matter that science pronounces upon. Moreover, <br>
I believe that we do not have a philosophically satisfactory and agreed-upon understanding <br>
of causation—not just causation that involves psychological factors, but causation generally.<br>
<br>
I make two points about this situation.<br>
<br>
The first is that the philosophical problems just cited do not include the one proposed <br>
by Descartes and subsequently taken up by his opponents. This is the problem of explain-<br>
ing how a seeming impossibility is possible. The seeming impossibility was supposed to be <br>
there being causal relations between mental and non-mental states or events, or indeed <br>
causation among mental states or events. Descartes’s idea was that given that mental sub-<br>
stance and physical substance are so fundamentally different, it was hard to see how they <br>
could interact. This view hinges on Descartes’s old-fashioned view of substance as involv-<br>
ing self-sufficiency. Almost no one applies such a notion to mental, or indeed physical, <br>
entities anymore. No one has explained, in the absence of such a conception, why relevant <br>
types of causation seem impossible. Perceptual psychology shows their possibility by <br>
explaining their actuality in systematic law-like ways.<br>
<br>
The second point is that given the lack of science, in the various theories of the mind–<br>
body relation and of causation involving psychological causes or effects, it borders on the <br>
crazy to hold that a very powerful science that provides causal computational laws of the <br>
relevant kind needs supplementation or should not be accepted at face value. Doing phil-<br>
oso phy of science of perception while constraining one’s inquiry by detailed positions on <br>
causation and the mind–body problem shows, I think, poor perspective on relations <br>
between science and metaphysics. Science has by far the better track record and is by far <br>
the more trustworthy guide.<br><br>

(LOT*), have tried to illumine psychological causation. I think it fair to say that over the last four decades or so, <br>
such attempts have been strikingly unsuccessful. For further discussion, see T. Burge, ‘Mind–Body Causation and <br>
Explanatory Practice’, in J. Heil and A. Mele eds., <i>Mental Causation</i> (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1993) and T. Burge, <br>
