bution of animacy may be attribution of agency. The “overflow” beyond neural patterns <br>
that correlate with application of shape shows up in visual areas of the brain. It emerges <br>
fairly late in visual processing.<br>
<br>
The psychological level of representation associated with functional dispositions that <br>
differentiate agency attribution from attribution of shape, motion, and body is not firmly <br>
established. Better understanding of their neural bases would be helpful. However, estab-<br>
lishing that agency attribution has a perceptual level depends primarily on computational <br>
models that map relevant motion, shape, body, and relational cues (say, for chasing), <br>
together with anticipations of functional upshots, to a perceptual attribution of agency. <br>
Such models have yet to be produced.<br><br>

<b>Attribution of Further Structural Elements of Agency<br><br>
</div>
</b>Questions remain about later-emerging aspects of primitive representation of agency. Are <br>
representations of them generated in the visual system? Is representation of sensory rela-<br>
tions between agents and potential targets perceptual? Is anticipation of the efficiency of <br>
acts perceptual?<br>
<br>
Representation of the <i>target</i> of an act seems to emerge later than the innate functional <br>
responses to shape. It emerges by 3–6 months in infants. Such representation is clearly and <br>
necessarily associated with attribution of agency. I think that this stage is probably percep-<br>
tual. Representation of another agent’s act’s target depends on anticipating targets when <br>
representing bodies with characteristic shapes or motions as agents.638 Making these con-<br>
nections may depend on learning to associate shapes or motions of types of agents with <br>
types of targets. Learned connections could be embedded in perceptual memory and in <br>
patterns of perceptual-state formation.<br>
<br>
Reflecting on some principal targets represented by higher animals elicits basic struc-<br>
tures likely to be associated with early agency representation.<br>
<br>
One class of targets is associated with eating and predation: gathering food, catching <br>
prey, avoiding being caught. Food gathering is often just foraging in a sampling way until <br>
food is sensorily registered, or perceptually represented. Then the animal moves directly <br>
to the food. Hunting takes various forms. Much hunting uses the same straightest-<br>
possible-line method used in food gathering. Many birds and mammals use these <br>
 methods. Sea gulls and raptors dive directly at their prey. Lions, which are not as fast as <br>
many of their prey, use short, direct runs from ambush sites. Some hunting involves pur-<br>
suit. Cheetahs and some monkeys and apes chase prey over long distances. In such cases, <br>
the hunter changes direction in response to changes in prey movement.<br>
<br>
Both hunter and hunted are more likely to succeed if they anticipate the most likely, <br>
most efficient, path of the antagonist, allowing for obstacles. To avoid wasting energy, even <br><br>

638 Attributing an act with a target does not require attributing a mental state that sets the target. A snail can <br>
have a target without representing it. It could have an instinctual urge whose functional causation of action is <br>
guided by non-perceptual sensing. So a representer of agency (we representers) can represent an act as having a <br>
target, without representing a conative state of the agent as representing the target.</div>
