Conceptions of Penetration 691</div>
<br><br>
treats directness of causal access to perception simply as lacking an intermediate represen-<br>
tational state that is not itself a perceptual state. In such reasoning, Gross does not discuss <br>
whether computations of visual operations operate on the non-perceptual, causally inter-<br>
mediate state or the initiating state. I think that Gross’s insight, though on a good track, is <br>
not clear and distinct.<br>
<br>
The second element that Gross posits as being part of Pylyshyn’s conception of pene tra-<br>
tion is semantic coherence. Gross takes the ‘basic idea’ of semantic coherence to be that of <br>
the penetrating state’s ‘not just causing’ the perceptual state, but ‘providing a reason for it’:<br><br>
It is not enough that the contents of early vision states be sensitive to those of cognitive <br>
<br>
states in the weaker sense of depending counterfactually, statistically, or in a law-like <br>
<br>
manner upon them. They must also do so in virtue of early vision itself operating over the <br>
<br>
cognitive states in a manner that mirrors a rational relation.1135<br><br>
It turns out that a reason or quasi-reason must provide an <i>epistemic</i>  basis. Gross then <br>
argues that attention does not in itself provide an epistemic basis for perception. It simply <br>
heightens and sharpens its operations. This epistemic notion of semantic coherence does <br>
most of the work in Gross’s argument that attention does not penetrate perception.<br>
<br>
I think that Gross’s appeals to reasons, quasi-reasons, mirroring rational relations, and <br>
providing epistemic bases are much less promising than what he says about presence in a <br>
computational operation. As mentioned earlier, talk of reasons in the perceptual system is <br>
metaphor. It is misleading metaphor. Emphasizing epistemic bases virtually trivializes the <br>
argument that attention does not penetrate perception. For it can be known, virtually <br>
apriori, that applications of attention are not <i>in themselves</i> any plausible analog of epi-<br>
stem ic reasons or of evidence. The appeal to epistemic reasons also seems to rule out <br>
intentions as possible penetrators in a similarly trivializing way. They too are not epistemic <br>
reasons. Gross is explicitly not concerned with intentions as penetrators. However, a good <br>
notion of penetration should allow for any penetrator, not just one that provides an analog <br>
of an epistemic reason.<br>
<br>
Insofar as one’s focus is on psychological kinds, understanding perceptual processing <i>as</i> <br>
confirmation is a mistake.1136 Many aspects of perceptual processing can be understood as <br>
making veridical perception more probable. As we saw in Chapter 15, the section <br>
Attention and Accuracy, however, some elements in normal perceptual process-<br>
ing—including applications of attention—do not function to, or even tend to, yield any-<br>
thing like confirmation. Attention can regularly introduce illusion into perceptual <br>
representation, and can make even approximately accurate perception less probable. <br>
Perception evolved by selection for fitness, not selection for confirmation.<br>
<br>
Gross’s strategy of appealing to epistemic notions like reasons, rationality, and epistemic <br>
bases is, relative to the aim of understanding psychological kinds, fundamentally <br>
flawed.1137 I take the main point of trying to understand modularity and penetration is to <br><br>

conceiving penetration epistemically <i>if</i> the aim is primarily to understand epistemic issues, <i>not</i> psychological <br>
