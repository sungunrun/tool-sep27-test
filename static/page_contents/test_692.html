understand natural psychological kinds and architecture. Given that focus, it is a mistake <br>
to found distinguishing psychological kinds on epistemology. First, epistemology is a the-<br>
ory of norms for use and operation of psychological competencies that can yield know-<br>
ledge. Epistemology should be grounded, partly, on an antecedent understanding of <br>
psy cho logic al competencies. It cannot serve to determine what those competencies are. <br>
Second, epistemology is less advanced than psychological explanation. Appeal to epis-<br>
temo logic al notions to delineate psychological kinds is regressive. Third, psychological <br>
kinds are delineated through psychological explanation. Psychological explanation is the <br>
only way to delineate patterns of causal interaction that determine what psychological <br>
kinds are. Epistemology is not psychological explanation. A concept of penetration that is <br>
to help in understanding psychological kinds cannot be guided by epistemology.<br>
<br>
The conception of cognitive penetration that I think most useful in understanding psy-<br>
cho logic al kinds is that of a cognitive state’s (its content and mode’s) being operated upon <br>
in a perceptual, or perceptual-motor, computational process. Fodor broached this concep-<br>
tion. He obscured it with his focus on causal access. In reflecting on Pylyshyn, Gross states <br>
an approximation to it, but does not much rely on it, leaning mainly on epistemic notions.<br>
<br>
Fodor and Pylyshyn’s encapsulation and impenetrability metaphors, while catchy, were <br>
naturally understood in terms of imperviousness to normal causal influence. While they <br>
believed in such imperviousness, they were concerned with understanding computation <br>
and computational explanation as marks of modularity. Computational operations com-<br>
prise just one type of pattern-based causal relation. The metaphors distracted from explor-<br>
ing the concern with computation. They distracted from focus on patterns that the science <br>
centers on—computational patterns.<br>
<br>
There are other notions besides the one that I have highlighted that yield insight into <br>
differences between lower-level and higher-level systems or aspects of a psychology. <br>
I think that the fundamental ways of demarcating lower-and higher-level aspects of <br>
psych ology are functional. (See this chapter, the section Psychological Systems <br>
and Psychological Kinds.) Here I pursue a notion of penetrability that requires a <br>
state to be an input or output of a computational system.<br>
<br>
Computation is signaled by computational explanations in science. Such explanations <br>
cite input from which an output—such as a perceptual state or motor command—is deter-<br>
mined by a mathematical function. Computational explanations dominate perceptual and <br>
motor psychology. Of course, a computation implements a competence. Competence can <br>
be affected by performance factors—especially by noise. Full explanations allow for noise. <br>
They are not fully deterministic. Despite noise, perceptual psychology and motor psych-<br>
ology take core perceptual and motor <i>competencies</i> to be computational.<br>
<br>
Understanding scientific causal psychological explanation is the best way to find psy-<br>
cho logic al kinds. The fact that perceptual and motor processing can be explained <br>
computationally is sufficient ground—though I think not a necessary ground—for taking <br>
them to form a system of psychological kinds, distinct from cognitive, or at least <br><br>

<b>Cont FN</b>But then they no longer center on what Fodor and Pylyshyn centered on. As I have intimated, (this chapter, the <br>
section The Original Epistemic Grounds for Reflecting on Cognitive Influence on <br>
Perception), the epistemic issues about cognition–perception relations are vastly less interesting and impor-<br>
tant, philosophically, than they seemed when Fodor first wrote. And as I argue in what follows, understanding the <br>
epistemic issues requires first understanding the psychological kinds that epistemic norms apply to. So a non-<br>
epistemic notion of penetration is needed in understanding those kinds, even if a further epistemically moti-<br>
vated one is added later.</div>
