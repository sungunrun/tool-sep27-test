contents of perceptual states are what they are partly because of the law-like trans form-<br>
ations that they enter into.114<br>
<br>
The main point of the distinction is simple. The principles are not the representa-<br>
tional contents of any occurrence in the system. Rather, they specify laws of transition <br>
among states.<br>
<br>
The contrast is analogous to one that occurs at higher psychological levels. A computer, <br>
animal, or child might be capable of making deductive transitions in reasoning, without <br>
having the meta-capabilities to specify inference rules used in the transitions. The distinc-<br>
tion is between a system that systematically makes transitions in accord with, and cor-<br>
rectly explainable in terms of, some principle, on one hand, and a system that does that <br>
and, further, has the capability to represent, perhaps unconsciously, the principles govern-<br>
ing the transitions that it, in fact, makes. The latter type of representation is always meta-<br>
representational. It always requires more sophistication than merely making inferences or <br>
other transitions by way of the principle.<br>
<br>
Principles of transition in perceptual systems bear some comparison to principles of <br>
inference in propositional thought. Computational modeling of perceptual systems nat ur-<br>
al ly makes this comparison salient. In conscious meta-thought, we are capable, as logi-<br>
cians, of specifying principles of transition. We can <i>think</i> the inference rules, not just think <br>
in ways correctly described by them.<br>
<br>
Perceptual transitions are specified by principles. The principles are unlike principles of <br>
propositional inference in systems of thought. Principles governing perceptual transitions <br>
are never represented in perceptual systems. Such principles are not looked up, applied, or <br>
accessed in a system, even “implicitly”. These metaphors, often used, are misleading. They <br>
should be avoided. The principles are not the contents of any state or event in a perceptual <br>
system. They are the contents of specifications by scientists of laws that the trans form-<br>
ations occur in. When principles of transformation are correctly described by scientists, <br>
the system operates as specified by the transformation principles. Psychological principles <br>
that govern transformations in perceptual systems describe real psychological laws instan-<br>
tiated in the transformations. But the laws are not represented in perceptual systems. By <br>
contrast, the perceptual states do have representational content, and are often accessible to <br>
perceivers’ consciousness.<br>
<br>
I emphasize this latter point because some misinformed glosses on perceptual psych-<br>
ology take it to be entirely a science of sub-individual psychological states, not a science of <br>
individual (including human) perception.115 Although transitions are nearly always beyond <br>
the reach of consciousness, the end states of the processing—fully formed perceptual states <br>
with their representational contents—are usually conscious. Since the science’s fundamen-<br>
tal aim is to explain <i>how</i> we see <i>what</i> we see and how illusions are formed, the science <br>
includes individuals’ perceptual states, phenomenally conscious states, in its account.<br>
<br>
A reason to deny that principles formulating laws of transformation are the represen-<br>
tational content of any state or event in the system is that they are principles that repre-<br>
sent perceptual states. Perceptual systems do not have meta-representational powers. <br><br>
