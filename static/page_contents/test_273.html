Egocentric Temporal Frameworks and Motion 273</div>
<br><br>
Actual perceptual representations of motion are kinematic. They are plotted across <br>
an iconic grid in real time. The representational content of the temporally extended per-<br>
ception changes as the motion proceeds. The movement is tracked by plotting its times <br>
and places across a spatio-temporal grid. Spatial and temporal intervals are limited only <br>
by perceptual discernibility. Changes in speed are also tracked. Most motions are per-<br>
ceived as passing through spatial regions continuously.<br>
<br>
Representing the trajectory through a succession of linguistic forms, each following a <br>
smallest discernible segment of the trajectory, would be unwieldy, to say the least. Plotting <br>
movements with complex trajectories and changes of speeds is much less cumbersome in <br>
iconic spatial/temporal frameworks. Perception does not have to generate separate spatial <br>
or temporal attributives to cover places and times in movements. The relevant attributions <br>
are generated through tracking the movement of a perceived entity on a relatively stable, <br>
iconic grid.<br>
<br>
So my formal illustration using two Loc attributives provides only the most idealized <br>
approximation of perceptual movement tracking. I think that Loc attributives are not <br>
themselves idealized. I think that they capture the real semantics of segments of motion <br>
tracking. The illustration abstracts from the iconic format in which such Loc attributives <br>
are situated and applied.<br>
<br>
Another aspect of perception of movement omitted in the idealized illustration is that <br>
modes of presentation—hence perceptual attributives—usually change <i>during</i> tracking <br>
moving bodies <i>even within</i> a single perceptual state. For example, the way in which <i>brown</i> <br>
and <i>cubical</i> are presented may vary, even if the attributes remain constant through the <br>
motion. The color might be shaded differently at different stages of the motion. Then the <br>
superscript on the attributive for <i>brown</i> changes and is associated with a different spatio-<br>
temporal segment of the movement.<br>
<br>
Similarly, the cubical shape of the body might be represented from different directions <br>
and distances over the course of the motion. Similar points apply to the attributives for <br>
<i>body</i> and movement. Modes of presentation, hence attributives, for a given attributive <br>
shift (motivating changes in superscripts), even as the attribute remains the same, and is <br>
tracked as that attribute.<br>
<br>
Changes in feature-like attributes of the tracked moving entity may also occur. A body <br>
might change from brown to red, or from cubical to round, in the temporal interval dur-<br>
ing which a given perception tracks the movement. Again, if these property changes are <br>
perceived during the movement, different modifying attributives succeed one another <br>
during the course of the temporally extended perceptual state—during the larger “pre-<br>
sent” of the perceptual state. Strictly, the color and shape attributives that are attributed to <br>
the body are relativized to a time. A perceptual state is a dynamically changing representa-<br>
tion of the changing world.<br>
<br>
The idealized representational content omits other aspects of the dynamics within given <br>
perceptions (not to mention the cross-saccadic dynamics of motion tracking). During a <br>
perception, the perceiver’s head or body may move. Such movements induce different <br>
modes of presentation of perceptually indicated attributes. Motion constancies compen-<br>
sate for perceiver movements. Here again, different types of perceptual states, with differ-<br>
ent representational contents, occur under the different conditions and the correspondingly <br>
different types of proximal stimulation.</div>
