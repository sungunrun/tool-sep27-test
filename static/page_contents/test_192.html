192  Form and Semantics of Perceptual Contents</div>
<br><br>
modify reference in a cross-attribute way, or relate guided specific references to particulars <br>
to one another. So perceptual representational contents lack quantifiers.<br>
<br>
Under quantifiers, here, I include the uniqueness operator—the one and only. As Russell <br>
recognized, this operator—though it produces semantically singular representation and <br>
may produce, contra Russell, formally singular representation, has the effect of generaliza-<br>
tion: whatever is the unique such and such. Perception does not generalize.<br>
<br>
I have explained absence of negation, disjunctions, conditionals, and standard quan ti-<br>
fiers from perceptual representational contents by reference to the primary representa-<br>
tional function of perception. Perception represents through representational content that <br>
structurally matches aspects of the spatio-temporal layout in natural scenes. Such iconic <br>
representation is incompatible with abstraction from commitment to specific representa-<br>
tion of an actual layout of particulars. Negations, disjunctions, conditionals, and quan ti-<br>
fiers all involve such abstraction.<br>
<br>
This point can be illustrated via comparison of perceptions with photographs, realist <br>
paintings, maps, and sketches. I support and elaborate this comparison in Chapter 9. Here <br>
I assume it for illustrative purposes. The iconic structure of such representations does not <br>
allow for the relevant logical operations. Take disjunction. If one were to evaluate a dis-<br>
junction with respect to a scene by photographing the scene, the photograph would repre-<br>
sent a scene that would make veridical one or the other of the disjuncts, or neither. It <br>
would not correspond to the disjunction itself.194 It carries more information than the <br>
 cor res pond ing disjunction.195 A picture represents a specific scene through structural <br>
matches of it. It cannot represent a disjunction of scenes. Perceptions are like photographs <br>
in this respect.<br>
<br>
One can infer from observing a photograph (more relevantly, from observing a scene in <br>
the way that a photograph represents it) that some situation is not instantiated. The photo-<br>
graph itself represents a specific scene by functioning to match it—not by negating some <br>
representation of a scene. Again, perceptions, like photographs, represent via structural <br>
matches supported by causal relations to a specific natural layout. Most quantificational <br>
generalizations can be made true by any of a number of different natural layouts. The the-<br>
one-and-only operator generalizes over a domain, whereas perception and realist pictures <br>
zero in on contextually picked-out entities.<br><br>

<b>FOOTNOTES</b><br>
<b>Cont FN</b>194 A similar point is made by S.-J. Shin, <i>The Logical Status of Diagrams</i> (Cambridge: Cambridge University <br>
Press, 1994), 180:<br>
Consider the following disjunctive information: Mary is to the left of Tom or is to the right of Tom. Suppose <br>
we take a picture to verify this information. If the information is correct, we will get <i>either</i> a picture of the situ-<br>
ation in which Mary is to the left of Tom <i>or</i> a picture of the situation in which Mary is to the right of Tom. We <br>
will never get a picture of the situation in which the disjunctive fact that Mary is to the left of or to the right of <br>
Tom is displayed. Interestingly, either of the pictures we might get conveys only one disjunct of the original dis-<br>
junctive information. That is, the picture will carry more than the original disjunctive information… . We can <br>
find a situation that supports disjunctive information. But this situation contains more than the disjunctive <br>
information.<br>
195 Exception: if one of the disjuncts is a contradiction, and the other carries the same information that the <br>
picture does, the information carried would, strictly speaking, be the same. Logical contradictions do not occur <br>
in perception. There may be Escher-like illusions in perception—representations as of impossible situations. <br>
Then a perception and a disjunction that is itself a contradiction might seem to carry the same information. <br>
However, even in this case the Escher-like picture seems to me to carry more information, since not <i>every</i> at tribu-<br>
tive in the picture is impossible. Even granting something like Escher-like illusions in perception and granting <br>
that they carry no information at all, which seems to me doubtful, such illusions would be sufficiently unusual <br>
that the point in the text is worth making. They would be exceptions on the edge. The Escher-like illusions cer-<br>
tainly do not support thinking that literal logical contradictions occur in perceptual contents.</div>
