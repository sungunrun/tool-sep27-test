objects were produced very quickly, there would be no time for the serially applied atten-<br>
tion that Treisman took to be required for binding.449 These suggestions of possible con-<br>
flict were developed and explored in subsequent work, both by Potter and by a second line <br>
of research.<br>
<br>
The second line of research joined Potter’s focus on visual representation resulting from <br>
very short exposures. This line began with two aims. One was to determine the minimum <br>
stimulus-exposure time for a perception to be formed. The other was to determine the short-<br>
est time needed for the visual system to form a perception on the basis of such exposure.<br>
<br>
Simon Thorpe and colleagues found that humans and monkeys can categorize natural <br>
images presented for exposures as brief as 20 ms—<i>one-fiftieth</i> of a second. Subjects were <br>
asked, or in the case of monkeys trained, to detect animal targets in indoor and outdoor <br>
scenes. The researchers recorded brain events that correlated with performances on go/<br>
no-go visual categorization tasks. The researchers found differential cerebral activity in <br>
humans that reflects representation of a category of entity, initially an animal-body, in a <br>
briefly presented picture (where the target picture had been presented in advance) in 150 ms <br>
after stimulus onset. In monkeys such cerebral activity occurred as fast as 80 ms after <br>
stimulus onset.450 Later research showed that humans can detect animal-bodies by 90 ms <br>
after 20 ms stimulus exposure, and faces and reptile-bodies even a little faster.451<br>
<br>
Foveal vision is not required for such categorization. Non-foveal placement of images <br>
does not significantly degrade performance. In fact, subjects identified animals, fairly reli-<br>
ably, well beyond the fovea in peripheral vision at 70 degrees eccentricity, even though <br>
subjects were not cued in advance regarding where an animal image would appear.<br>
<br>
The researchers concluded that detection was too fast to depend on attention.452 This <br>
research, and extensions of it, count against the idea that visual perception of objects with <br>
properties bound to them depends on applications of attention. Again, this is not to say <br>
that attention does not figure in the perceptions. It is to say that it is not necessary for <br>
selecting or binding features to objects perceived as animal-bodies or faces.<br>
<br>
Even at these speeds, Thorpe’s idea of a fully feed-forward process must be rejected. <br>
There are intra-visual-system, recurrent feedback loops that start sooner than 60 ms post <br>
stimulus onset. Neural evidence suggests that nearly all kinds of visual processing involve <br>
recurrent feedback loops among visual areas. This evidence accumulated after Thorpe and <br>
colleagues did their initial work.<br><br>
