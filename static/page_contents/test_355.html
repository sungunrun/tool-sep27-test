<b>Relations Between Iconic Format and Representational Content<br><br>
</div>
</b>In this chapter I have aimed to understand wherein perception is <i>iconic</i>. I return to how <br>
perceptual <i>representational content</i> and <i>representation</i> are to be understood in an <br>
iconic format.<br>
<br>
The representational content of human vision has a matrix format that maps (<i>modulo</i> <br>
special circumstances) into a <i>Big Surface</i>—a non-planar 2-D area of space with three-<br>
dimensional significance. <i>Big Surface</i> consists of the positions of all facing surface-parts <br>
that reflect light into the perceiver’s retina and that are perceived at a given time. Perceptual <br>
attributives apply to surfaces and surface-parts in <i>Big Surface—</i>but not to <i>Big Surface</i> itself. <br>
Perceptual representation of the perceived entities that determine <i>Big Surface</i> takes the <br>
form of a matrix.<br>
<br>
Each smallest position in the matrix that functions to represent a particular is normally <br>
associated with multiple perceptual attributives, as is each molar position in the matrix. <br>
Strictly, it is not the parts, or positions, in the matrix that do the representing. It is proper-<br>
ties or aspects of those parts or in those positions. A given position in the matrix might be <br>
associated with various representational contents—various perceptual competencies:<br><br>
 (a) an attributive that functions to represent something as a surface;<br>
<br>
 (b) a relational attributive that functions to represent that surface as a part of a larger <br>
<br>
natural-unit surface, itself represented as a surface;<br>
<br>
 (c) an attributive that functions to represent the surface’s position or depth in 3-D <br>
<br>
space [relative to an egocentric anchor];<br>
<br>
 (d) an attributive that functions to represent the surface’s position with respect to the <br>
<br>
larger natural-unit surface and other parts of that larger surface. [This attributive is <br>
<br>
really just an aspect of the egocentrically anchored spatial framework that is ap plic-<br>
<br>
able to the surface.]<br>
<br>
 (e) an attributive that functions to represent the surface’s position within an object-<br>
<br>
centered framework applicable to the larger natural-unit surface;<br>
<br>
 (f) an attributive that functions to represent the surface’s orientation;<br>
<br>
 (g) an attributive that functions to represent the surface’s size;<br>
<br>
 (h) an attributive that functions to represent the surface’s shape;<br>
<br>
 (i) an attributive that functions to represent the surface’s color.<br><br>
Recall that attributives are simply kinds of representational competencies that fall into <br>
distinctive psychological patterns. An application of an attributive in a perceptual state is <br>
an exercise of a competence, an exercise triggered by an occurrent stimulus.<br>
<br>
Size and shape are represented by different aspects of the matrix’s cell or combination of <br>
cells. Instances of size and instances of shape are different perceivables. Perception of an <br>
instance of size involves one referential application. Perception of an instance of shape <br>
involves another. Each referential application is accompanied by an attributive that guides <br>
it. The instance of size could be more attended to than the instance of shape. The percep-<br>
tual applications to the different tropes could be remembered to different extents. So the <br>
size and shape attributives are psychologically different from one another and from the <br>
locational attributives in (c), (d), and (e).</div>
