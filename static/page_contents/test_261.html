Egocentric Spatial Indexes in Perception 261</div>
<br><br>
Egocentric indexes themselves have representational structure. There are three distin-<br>
guishable features in any egocentric index that refers to a framework origin.<br>
<br>
First, there is an ability-general, indexical, schematic content that marks a competence <br>
to apply a spatial indexical. Strictly, there are two competencies marked by this content. <br>
One is the generic indexical competence to determine a referent in a rule-governed, <br>
context-dependent way. The other is the specific competence to attribute spatiality (<i>here-<br>
ness</i>) to the referent of a referential application of the indexical. I mark these two compe-<br>
tencies with a single ability-general schematic representational content. I use ‘here’ to <br>
stand for this schematic representational content.<br>
<br>
Here is too unspecific to constitute a spatial indexical competence. Most representer-<br>
centered indexes are applicable to very specific parts of the body. In monocular vision, the <br>
origin tends to be the position of the eye. A common index for mammalian binocular <br>
vision applies to the cyclopean eye. Let us append a ‘c’ to ‘here’ to indicate an operation of <br>
applying the indexical to a specific place on the perceiver’s body, as origin for the visual <br>
spatial framework: here-c. Here-c operates as a semantical unit. It is an indexical sche-<br>
matic form whose content restricts singular referential applications of it to a specific <br>
pos ition on the body.<br>
<br>
Second, there is the ability-general content that is the competence to give applications <br>
of here-c (and their referents) immediate, privileged ego-significance for the individual’s <br>
needs, action targets, and perspective.<br>
<br>
Ego-significance markers can also figure in temporal and other non-spatial representa-<br>
tional frameworks. Since they mark a distinct psychological competence, with a distinct <br>
mode of presentation, they constitute an aspect of representational content. They cannot <br>
determine a <i>representatum</i> by themselves. They are schematic. They simply mark a compe-<br>
tence to relevantly privilege applications of restricters of reference, such as here-c.<br>
<br>
So the ability-general schematic representational content of a spatial egocentric index is <br>
here-cego. The ‘ego’ superscript marks an aspect of the mode of presentation of the referent, <br>
when the schema is applied. A place is presented as ego-significant. The main psy cho-<br>
logic al import of the superscript is, however, not semantical. It is to mark the connection <br>
of the place to needs and motives. It thus has “horizontal”, not “vertical”, significance.<br>
<br>
Third, there is the occurrence-based referential application, in a context, of the sche-<br>
matic egocentric index. In perception, such applications are events. They are occurrent <br>
exercises of the ability-general indexical schema, picking out the anchor of a contextually <br>
applied spatial coordinate system. So an applied representational content of our egocen-<br>
tric index is here-cego1.<br>
<br>
Egocentric indexes are nearly pervasive in perceptual representation. So our previous <br>
presentation of the applied visual perceptual content that brown cubical body,<br><br>
(that x1)[(that x2)(that x3)<br>
<br>
(brownr1(c)(x1), brownr1(i)(x2), cubicalb1(c)(x1), cubicalb1(i)(x3), bodyd1(i)(x1))],<br><br>
must be refined. The refinement will still ignore iconic structure. I take up this matter in <br>
Chapter 9.<br>
<br>
Indexical applications of egocentric spatial indexes refer to positions in space. They are <br>
guided to a position by the indexical attributive here-c and by the rule governing the <br>
attributive. Their being referential derives from their function in singling out a spatial </div>
