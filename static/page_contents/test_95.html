<br>
Thus a complex attributive car-shaped car-body does not imply that a perceiver has a <br>
representational content car. It implies that the perceiver can discriminate bodies with car-<br>
shapes and has a psychologically significant grouping for bodies shaped like cars. Similarly, <br>
for hyphenated attributives for animal kinds like <i>cat.</i> The perceiver can be expected to <br>
treat cats as living or at least agents, because their motion is distinctive of agents. Neither <br>
an uninformed perceiver nor any perceptual system can be expected to discriminate cats <br>
as forming a natural kind, constituting a biological species with a distinctive biological <br>
structure or evolutionary tree. Perceptual systems attribute entirely on the basis of per-<br>
ceivable characteristics. The attributive marks a capacity to distinguish a sub-class of <br>
shapes, or bodies by their shapes (and sizes and motions). It is known that perceptual sys-<br>
tems attribute <i>shape</i> and <i>body</i>, and specific groupings of bodies (<i>cat-body</i>) distinguished <br>
by shape. To attribute the <i>different</i> kind <i>cat</i>, it would have to have a distinct capacity <br>
mapped to the biological species. There is no reason to think the perceptual systems have <br>
such additional capacities. The perceptual systems of some higher mammals probably also <br>
attribute some functions to bodies (<i>edible</i>, <i>predator</i>), even to bodies that are artifacts. This <br>
matter has not been investigated in detail. I discuss associated methodological issues in <br>
Chapter 4, the section Two Methodological Points Regarding Natural-<br>
Kind and Functional Attributives and in Chapter 12.<br>
<br>
The main types of perceptual categorization in mammalian vision are of objects on the <br>
basis of their shapes, sizes, and motions. Such objects include generic bodies, determined <br>
by a relatively continuous outer boundary; bodies psychologically grouped by specific <br>
shape—like dog-bodies and road-vehicle-bodies—and main body-parts, for example, <br>
eyes, hands, and faces.<br>
<br>
Grouping distinctions, by shape, among instances of generic categories (<i>body</i>) produce <br>
more specific categorizations (<i>dog-body</i> or <i>beagle-body</i>). <i>Recognition</i> of <i>particulars</i> often <br>
involves combining perception and memory. Because familiarity can also be built into <br>
perceptual capacities, specific perceptual categorization, and even recognition of particu-<br>
lars, as familiar does not always depend essentially on memory. The first categorizations in <br>
perception-formation are produced by dominantly bottom-up processing.98 (See <br>
Chapter 10.) Refinement of such categorization is effected by feedback that is broadly per-<br>
ceptual. (See Chapter 11, the section Categorization and TiMing; Chapter 13; <br>
Chapter 17, the section Ability-General Long-TerM Visual Perceptual <br>
MeMory; and Chapter 18, the section Perceptual Learning.)<br>
<br>
Perceptual categorization is categorization entirely by <i>perceptual</i> attributives. Even per-<br>
ceptual categorization aided by memory is effected entirely by perceptual attributives. The <br>
relevant contributions from memory are retentions of perceptual attributives, or exten-<br>
sions through perceptual learning from previous perceptual attributives. Both generic and <br>
more specific categorizations of bodies depend on exercising spatial perceptual constan-<br>
cies. Normally, the categorizations piggy-back on spatial constancies.<br>
<br>
It is often noted that categorization and individuation have superficially contrary tasks. <br>
Individuation requires discrimination within kinds and among particulars. An animal <br><br>
