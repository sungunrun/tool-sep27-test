They could be delineated through tracing the circle in perceptual attention or im agin ation, <br>
or if natural textural boundaries marked it. Lacking a marking of the circle’s bound ar ies, <br>
however, the application of a perceptual attributive of the shape of an arbitrary sub-part of <br>
the surface would not be an operation that the system carries out.<br>
<br>
By contrast, the shape of a surface, the shape of an edge of the surface, or the shape of a <br>
textural element on the surface would be represented by a visual system. The shape would <br>
be determined by the plot of its boundaries and the orientations of its surface-parts. <br>
Computations of spatial attributes (such as computation of edges, edge lengths, edge <br>
shapes, edge orientations, surfaces, surface shapes, surface sizes, surface orientations, sur-<br>
face textural elements, 3-D volume shapes, 3-D sizes, bodies, and so on) are present in the <br>
most basic representations of these items. That is what it means to say that such spatial <br>
elements are represented by means of a coordinate system. They are not just represented. <br>
They are plotted. They and their perceptually discernible spatial parts are located—some-<br>
times in detail, but often with some indeterminacies—in a coordinate system.<br>
<br>
Given that in reasonably complex visual perceptual systems, spatial attributes are often <br>
specified, at the most basic perceptual level, in a coordinate system anchored on the per-<br>
ceiver, and given that the relation between the perceiver and those attributes can change, <br>
the most basic perceptual representations of a given spatial attribute can change. Any nor-<br>
mal perceptual system that represents spatial attributes has many, coordinate-system-based <br>
ways of representing any given spatial attribute. For these reasons, minimalism is untenable.<br>
<br>
Let us consider how attributives for color, lightness, and motion, are associated with <br>
iconic representation of spatial attributes.<br>
<br>
Motion is plotted in spatio-temporal coordinate systems. The temporal plotting is <br>
anchored in an egocentrically indexed present time. The anchor is indexed either to the <br>
time of the perceptual state, or to some specific time within the duration of the perceptual <br>
state. (See Chapter 8.)<br>
<br>
Attributives for color and lightness normally place instances of those properties at pos-<br>
itions on mapped surfaces and bodies. It is possible for there to be color constancies, hence <br>
color perception, without associating them with spatial location or direction-cum-ordinal <br>
depth. A simple animal could, I think, have color perception without spatial perception. <br>
There may be pathologies or special conditions in which mammalian vision engenders <br>
such perception. However, visual perceptual systems of reasonable complexity normally <br>
compute color and/or lightness attributives, iconically in a spatial coordinate system.<br>
<br>
A visual system represents a direction and a distance, or an ordinal depth, from the <br>
egocentric anchor in roughly the same way on each occasion.220 Unit-free specifications of <br>
magnitudes are reapplied. Specific, given spatial attributes of entities perceived <i>in</i> space are <br>
represented via different combinations of these canonical specifications of magnitudes. <br>
The specifications vary with spatial relations between perceived entities and the perceiver.<br>
<br>
In these respects, perceptual representation differs sharply from linguistic representa-<br>
tion. Linguistic representation is, I think, the model that inspires the minimalist concep-<br>
tion of perceptual attribution. There are many routes for forming the belief mercury is an <br>
element. We can use a single concept mercury despite major variations in stimulus <br><br>

<b>Cont FN</b>220 In Chapter 15 it is shown that attention can cause remappings. So this “sameness” should not be expected <br>
to apply rigidly. Still, there is a broad stability to how coordinate systems and plotting operate from one occasion <br>
to another, for a given perceptual system.</div>
