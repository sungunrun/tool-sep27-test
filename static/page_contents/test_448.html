the spatio-temporal patterns described in the preceding quotations, together with strong <br>
expectation of continuation of the patterns.574<br>
<br>
Kant differed from Hume. In accord with common sense, Kant held that representation <br>
of causation is not reducible so that representation of spatio-temporal patterns is their sole <br>
objective content. Kant and Hume agreed, however, that no representation of causation is <br>
perceptual. Kant thought that it was a contribution from a higher cognitive capacity— <br>
understanding.575<br>
<br>
In the 1940s, the Belgian psychologist Albert Michotte ran experiments that he took to <br>
show that humans represent causation via an innate perceptual mechanism.576 Michotte’s <br>
work became influential. Several psychologists developed and refined it. The work is com-<br>
monly interpreted as supporting Kant against Hume. In fact, it sides with Kant in holding <br>
that a causal attributive develops naturally in human beings and has no subjective elem-<br>
ent. Michotte differs from Kant as well as Hume in maintaining that there is a perceptual, <br>
as well as conceptual, attributive for <i>cause</i>.<br>
<br>
Michotte’s conclusions regarding both the innateness and the perceptual nature of <br>
primitive representation of <i>cause</i> are controversial in psychology. Michotte was far from <br>
establishing his claims. I think it likely that he was right in both of them. I focus on the <br>
second controversy.<br>
<br>
Michotte presented adult subjects with a scene in which a square moves horizon-<br>
tally at a constant rate of speed until it becomes contiguous with a second square, at <br>
which point it stops. The second square begins to move away from the first in the <br>
same direction, immediately on being contiguous with it. The subjects report that the <br>
first square pushes the second, or causes it to move. Michotte termed this impression <br>
on observers ‘<i>the launching effect</i>’. In other experiments, the first and second square <br>
remain attached as they move forward together after the first comes to be contiguous <br>
with the second. Adult subjects report that the first square carries or takes the second <br>
with it, or makes it go forward. Michotte counted this impression ‘<i>the entrainment <br>
effect</i>’. See Figure 12.1.<br>
<br>
Michotte was impressed by the subjects’ report that the perceived events give ‘an imme-<br>
diate causal impression’. He took seriously their reports that they see one object as acting <br>
on another, producing certain changes. He also took seriously the fact that although the <br><br>
