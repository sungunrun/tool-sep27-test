318 The Iconic Nature of Perception</div>
<br><br>
I lay these problems of detail aside. Analogs will return, because they connect to funda-<br>
mental difficulties. One might think that, so far, I have just shown how careless Fodor has <br>
been. One might think that his position can easily be repaired.<br>
<br>
One partial repair would be to construct a principle for the whole <i>scene</i>  that the picture <br>
depicts. The point of the repair is to show that every part of the picture pictures a part of <br>
the scene. Even highlights are parts of the scene, even though they are not parts of any-<br>
thing else pictured in the scene. Take a realist painting of three real giraffes. The principle <br>
implies that the top half of the picture depicts a part of the scene. This is claimed to be so, <br>
even though the top half cuts across the middle of the giraffes’ bodies, cuts across trees <br>
and their branches, and depicts an amalgam of foreground body-parts and background <br>
tree-parts. One might add, channeling ARG, that one can “cut up” the picture any way one <br>
likes; and the cut-up parts will picture parts of the scene. Any arbitrary cutting could be <br>
reassembled to produce the original picture. One might take this argument to support <br>
‘Picture Principle (2)’:<br><br>
PP(2): Every part of a picture pictures a part of the scene that the picture pictures.345<br><br>
One might take PP(2) to show that pictures lack canonical decompositions and to show <br>
(a)–(h).<br>
<br>
PP(2) still needs qualification for micro-parts that do not depict anything. Let us <br>
 consider this qualification of PP(2).<br><br>
PP(2΄) Every part of a picture that pictures anything pictures a part of the scene that <br>
<br>
the picture pictures<br><br>
PP(2΄) and the argument for it are intuitive for some. But intuitiveness does not vindi-<br>
cate them, or support conclusions about pictures and iconic mental representations that <br>
Fodor infers from PP(1). The basic problem for PP(1), PP(2), and PP(2΄) is that the arbi-<br>
trary representational units (whether primitive or combinations of primitives) that they <br>
allow correspond to no units grounded in use or understanding of pictures. Any serious <br>
semantics for pictures—like any serious semantics for <i>any</i> representation—must be <br>
grounded in representational usage and competence.<br>
<br>
Like all representation, iconic representation gets its representational structure from <br>
the representational competencies that underlie its use. Representational structure marks <br>
aspects of representational competencies. Iconicity is an aspect of representational format. <br>
Although it affects how a subject matter is represented, it is not an aspect of <i>basic</i> repre-<br>
sentational structure or function. Its basic representational structure and functions—attri-<br>
bution and reference—are shared with non-iconic language and non-iconic thought. I try <br>
to make vivid these points, and their application to Fodor’s view, by developing them slowly.<br>
<br>
Let us be more specific about what a <i>part</i> of a picture is. Let us focus on parts that are <br>
on the surface and intuitively relevant to understanding the picture.<br><br>

inspired by Fodor, although they do not present it as a repair of Fodor’s mistakes. They argue for PP(2) in ways <br>
nearly identical to the way in which Fodor argues for PP(1)—again using Kosslyn’s example of cutting up a pic-<br>
