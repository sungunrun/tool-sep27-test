moving, when it is not moving. Shifting of visual perspective across saccades is normally <br>
not conscious.<br>
<br>
Stable representation of a stable world must overcome two problems engendered by <br>
saccadic shifting of eye direction.<br>
<br>
One is blurring or blanking out of the image. This problem is dealt with through very low-<br>
level mechanisms. Sensitivity to saccadic movement, to detection of motion, and to detection <br>
of displacement are suppressed.836 Such suppression has at least two sources. One is <i>corollary <br>
discharge</i> that occurs simultaneously with or just prior to initiation of a saccade, and indepen-<br>
dently of any retinal input. Corollary discharges are triggered by proprioceptive input from <br>
motor commands. So they include efference copy. The corollary discharge anticipates the sac-<br>
cade and the sensory input that will come when the saccade is completed. The other source of <br>
suppression is forward masking mechanisms. <i>Forward masking</i> is a stimulus that operates on a <br>
later retinal stimulus in such a way as to block generation of a perceptual state from the later <br>
stimulus. <i>Backward masking</i> is a stimulus that blocks formation of a perceptual state from a <br>
retinal stimulus that comes before the blocking, or masking, stimulus. Unlike corollary dis-<br>
charge, both types of masking operate on retinal input. In forward masking of blur, a blurred <br>
stimulus that would be caused by a saccade is blocked from forming a blurred perception.837<br>
<br>
Both corollary-discharge mechanisms and forward-masking mechanisms figure in sup-<br>
pressing blur in many visual systems. Masking is more dominant in normal, high-contrast situ-<br>
ations. Corollary discharge is more dominant in the less common, low contrast situations.838<br>
<br>
A second problem must be overcome if the visual system is to achieve stable representa-<br>
tion, given displacement of the retinal image with each saccade. For our purposes, this is <br>
the more central problem. Trans-saccadic memory (TSM) figures in overcoming it. Stable <br>
representational content from a perception before a saccade must be integrated with rep-<br>
resentational content from a perception after a saccade, to yield smooth, continuous <br>
ex peri ence. TSM is a factor in such integration. The integration includes TSM’s retaining <br>
information from previous visual fixations, to be used later. Before developing this point, I <br>
sketch antecedents of current views of TSM.<br>
<br>
An early hypothesis was that a relatively full image is retained from earlier fixations. <br>
Integration of remembered images with current perceptual images consists, on this view, in <br>
superimposition of the perceptual image in a current fixation on the retained perceptual <br>
image, yielding a fused percept. Such a view suggested that TSM is an extension of iconic <br>
memory, with a similar, huge memory capacity. But attempts to get subjects to fuse dot matri-<br>
ces presented before and after a saccade failed to provide evidence for fusing rich images.839<br>
<br>
This result led to comparisons of TSM to another type of short-term memory, visual <br>
working memory. Many think that TSM operates on a time course and has capacity limits <br><br>
