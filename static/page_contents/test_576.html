576 Perceptual Memory: Short-Term Systems</div>
<br><br>
FVSTM has a smaller retention capacity than the sensory icon or iconic memory. <br>
FVSTM has perhaps double the storage capacity of visual working memory. For vividness <br>
sake, FVSTM has a storage capacity of about 6–8 integrated objects (with their features).832<br>
<br>
Recall that the sensory icon fades after 100–200 ms. Information in iconic memory lasts <br>
500 ms and is almost as rich as the sensory icon. It is disputed whether FVSTM is phe-<br>
nomenally conscious. I think that the balance of evidence suggests that it sometimes is.833 <br>
In humans, FVSTM seems to be rational-access conscious in limited ways. For example, <br>
when individuals are given views of columns and rows of simple objects, they can freely <br>
recall generic aspects of the array. They freely recall some of the items whose change they <br>
detect in change-detection cases. To determine the full representational content of <br>
FVSTM, the information must be cued. It shows itself in forced-choice recall tests. So <br>
some of the representational content of FVSTM is probably freely accessible to conscious-<br>
ness, but much of it is not. FVSTM is in iconic format.<br>
<br>
The relation between iconic memory and FVSTM is not well understood. If FVSTM is not <br>
itself an aspect of iconic memory, it is a functionally similar extension of it. FVSTM has much <br>
smaller storage capacity. Its contents last longer—fading gradually over 4–5 se conds. Like <br>
iconic memory, FVSTM retains a selection of phenomenally conscious material from the sen-<br>
sory icon—the phenomenally conscious and rational-access conscious image that lasts <br>
100–200 ms. Iconic memory’s richer contents, but shorter time span, suggest that it may be an <br>
earlier stage in the memory process continued by FVSTM. The sensory icon and iconic mem-<br>
ory have been thought to be closely associated with V1,834 although retention in iconic mem-<br>
ory of perceptual information about spatial location suggests that it involves input, perhaps <br>
via recurrent feedback to V1, from higher brain areas. FVSTM seems associated with V4.<br>
<br>
What is <i>consciously</i> accessible from perception at any given time is severely limited. <br>
Such limitation may protect against overload that might crowd out information urgently <br>
needed for action that can skip conscious accessibility.<br><br>

<b>Trans-Saccadic Memory<br><br>
</div>
</b>A further type of very short-term memory is trans-saccadic memory (TSM). Saccades are <br>
shifts of the eyes that function to scan the environment. In humans, foveal vision is vastly <br>
more precise than peripheral vision. One function of saccadic eye movement is to apply <br>
precise visual representation to more of the scene, in quick succession. This function is <br>
closely associated with the direction of attention, exogenous and endogenous.835 Other <br>
functions of TSM are to support visual search and to help guide motor movement.<br>
<br>
In humans, saccades occur automatically at about three per second. They last 10–50 ms. <br>
During saccades, perceivers are effectively blind. We do not experience the world as blank-<br>
ing out during saccades. We do not automatically, or normally, experience the world as <br><br>
