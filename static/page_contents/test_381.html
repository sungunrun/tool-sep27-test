Change Detection 381</div>
<br><br>
Several factors seem to be involved in failures of change detection. Fixating an object <br>
between saccadic eye movements enhances the likelihood of consciously accessible detec-<br>
tion of changed scenes, and may be necessary for some kinds of conscious detection of a <br>
change itself. Fixation usually involves attention. Attention facilitates access to conscious <br>
working memory.408 In experiencing change-detection failures, most subjects use succes-<br>
sive fixations to try to find the change. They search the perceived scenes, fixating one <br>
aspect of the scene after another. Success in detecting a changed item often follows fixating <br>
the aspect of the scene that is subsequently noted as changed. Moreover, once a perceived <br>
object has been fixated and attended to, detection of a change in that object remains well <br>
above chance for several seconds. As a subject scans a picture looking for changes, changes <br>
in previously attended objects are more likely to be detected.409<br>
<br>
Fixation and attention do not, however, guarantee change detection. Subjects often fail <br>
to detect changes in entities that were previously attended and fixated.410 So although fix-<br>
ation and attention are factors, they are not the whole story.<br>
<br>
The primary sources of change-detection failure lie in the ways perception interacts <br>
with various sorts of memory and in the accessibility of aspects of perception, and par-<br>
ticularly memory, to consciousness. Change-detection failures rarely result from failures <br>
of perception <i>per se</i>.<br>
<br>
Some maintained that forgetting is central in change-detection failures. The claim is not <br>
worthless, but can mislead. Many types of memory figure in change detection. A change <br>
detection’s not showing up in one type of memory does not indicate its absence <br>
from others.<br>
<br>
An eidetic phenomenological image from perception decays quickly. It lasts only on the <br>
order of 250 ms, depending on stimulus intensity, stimulus duration, and other factors. <br>
Such phenomenological images are masked or overwritten by subsequent perceptual <br>
intake. One lacks a conscious image to consult in comparing different perceptions of a <br>
changing scene.411<br>
<br>
Changes from detailed sensory information that is lost when phenomenological images <br>
decay can underlie failures in change detection. Information from the phenomenological <br>
image is retained and is separately, non-phenomenally stored, even as the image decays. <br>
This information also decays quickly. Loss of such information or failure to retrieve it for <br>
conscious access can be a source of failure of change detection.412 However, the more dra-<br>
matic failures in change detection cannot be attributed to sensory image decay.<br><br>

image is changed; yet the changes are not detected. The experiments show that even across saccades, what is retained <br>
is not an eidetic image, but attributions that center on spatial structures and colors over fairly large regions.</div>
