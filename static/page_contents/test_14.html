The change in understanding how complex visual processing is has encouraged philo-<br>
sophical and scientific discussion of “cognitive penetration” into visual processing. To <br>
what extent and in what ways do representational capacities that are not perception enter <br>
into visual processing? Are some of the capacities, like attention, memory, and so on, “cog-<br>
nitive”? Does background propositional-level intention, belief, or knowledge affect visual <br>
processing? If so, how? This discussion requires detailed reflection on the psychological <br>
processing, and the specific character, of generic capacities like attention, memory, and so <br>
on—insofar as they enter into visual processing. It also requires serious discussion of the <br>
terms ‘cognitive’ and ‘penetration’. The term ‘cognitive’ is used in many, often thoughtless, <br>
ways. The term ‘penetration’ is also used in different ways. In both cases, undisciplined <br>
uses and insufficient reflection obscure how perceptual-level processing is explained in <br>
perceptual psychology.<br>
<br>
The philosophical interest of these issues, for me, is that they bear on understanding <br>
joints in nature that border perceptual representation. It is arrogant to think that we <br>
“carve” joints. We do not do anything to them. When we try to carve, we make a bloody <br>
mess. We discover them. At least, sometimes. Discovery is more delicate and less intrusive <br>
than carving. Perceptual psychology has advanced to a stage where it can help guide dis-<br>
covery. I argue that visual perceptual processing forms a system with several capacities <br>
that are not themselves perception—including some types of attention, action-guidance, <br>
anticipation, and memory. I argue that these capacities are <i>perceptual-level</i> in that they <br>
derive all or many of their representational contents from perception and are not in any <br>
way more sophisticated than perception. The basic representational structure and the <br>
sophistication of transitions or operations in these systems are not more advanced or fun-<br>
damentally different from the structure and transitions in perception.<br>
<br>
As noted, these perceptual-level capacities do interact with propositional, “cognitive” <br>
capacities. Yet, in a sense to be discussed, propositional capacities are not part of a certain <br>
system with perception, or its most closely associated perceptual-level capacities.<br>
<br>
The third and fifth aims bear on the upper border of perception and perceptual-level <br>
processes—their relation to higher level representational capacities, especially prop os-<br>
ition al capacities. In the early chapters of the book, I discuss the lower border of percep-<br>
tion. This border divides perception and perceptual-level capacities from non-perceptual <br>
sensing and from action that is not guided by perception or any other representational <br>
capacity. This discussion mostly reviews accounts already provided in <i>Origins of Objectivity</i>. <br>
It also refines these accounts. Parts II and III of the present book discuss the heartland—<br>
visual perception itself. In Part IV, I try to understand some central aspects of perception’s, <br>
and perceptual-level capacities’, upper border—their border with more advanced kinds of <br>
representation.<br>
<br>
Propositional-level intention, belief, and knowledge lie on the other side of this <br>
upper border. I discuss in Chapter 19 whether there are non-propositional types of repre-<br>
sentation that are more “advanced” in some deep principled way than perception—thus <br>
 perhaps a kind of intermediate territory between the perceptual level and the level of <br>
propositional thought.<br>
<br>
The book concludes with reflections on the importance of the border between perceptual-<br>
level representation and propositional representation. The latter is necessary for science, <br>
understanding, morality, art. Perceptual-level states are an indispensable ground for these <br>
enterprises. This project aims at understanding the capacities that formed this ground.</div>
