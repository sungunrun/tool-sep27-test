488 Perceptual-Level Representation and Categorization</div>
<br><br>
In psychology, calling perceptual categorization ‘cognitive’ sometimes derives merely <br>
from using ‘cognitive’ to apply to a “higher-level” type of <i>perception.</i> Such uses, among the <br>
most common in the scientific literature, do <i>not</i> purport to mark a boundary between <br>
perception and a higher-level type of representation. They <i>include</i> certain types of percep-<br>
tion as types of cognition. Initially, such uses were aspects of the movement to reclaim <br>
“cognitive”, or representational, psychology from behaviorist attempts to avoid appeal to <br>
any sort of representation. I see no <i>current</i> value in these very broad uses of the term ‘cog-<br>
nitive’. I caution against their being misleading, in thinking about psychological kinds. <br>
They play no central role in my discussion.<br>
<br>
I use ‘cognition’ so as to exclude perception. I use it to apply to capacities that are supra-<br>
perceptual. This usage is dominant in discussions of penetration of perception by “cognition”.<br>
<br>
In this section, I emphasize that the genus <i>categorization</i> has a perceptual species. Of <br>
course, there is conceptual categorization—categorization via representation that functions <br>
constitutively to contribute to a propositional structure. I focus on perceptual cat egor iza-<br>
tion—categorization through perceptual attributives, categorization that is generated in a <br>
perceptual system. Such categorization does not function constitutively to contribute to a <br>
propositional structure, or a system of propositional attitudes connected by capacities for <br>
propositional inference. The categorization that I discuss is not a cognitive phenomenon.<br>
<br>
Some philosophers and a few scientists still take all categorization to be non-perceptual <br>
or supra-perceptual. They take all categorization to contrast with perception proper. This <br>
view is a holdover from the view of Marr and Ullman, in the 1980s and early 1990s, that <br>
true perception ends with the 2½-D sketch, never even including representation as of 3-D <br>
volume shapes. (See Chapter 10, the section Marr’s 2½-D Sketch.) I think it fair to <br>
say that vision science has yielded no support for this idea. The simplest basis for this <br>
change in the science is the discovery that first-formed perception yields categorization <br>
before input from memory or endogenous attention even begins.648<br>
<br>
The speed and directness of processing the simplest categorizations (allowing for intra-<br>
perceptual loops) in 60–100 ms after stimulus onset suggests, and is taken in the science to <br>
be, a single process. One needs an argument that there is an important cut after processing <br>
perceptual representations of whatever type of shapes are taken to be the last genuinely <br>
perceptual representations, on one hand, and processing representations as of faces and <br>
bodies, by their shapes, that is integral to early categorization, on the other.<br>
<br>
Sometimes it is said that categorization is the first advent of “meaning”, or the advent of <br>
“semantic” properties, in the formation process.649 It might be thought that a transition <br>
from non-meaningful attributions to “meaningful” ones constitutes a difference between <br><br>
