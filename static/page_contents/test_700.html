I think Block, Firestone, and Scholl right to take such cases as non-revolutionary. No <br>
one doubted that belief and intention affect attention. It was not obvious, until experimen-<br>
tal work starting in the 1990s, how richly attention affects perceptual processing. It has <br>
been learned that perceptual processing is more complex, and more open, as it proceeds, <br>
to attentional influence than is allowed by the simple feed-forward picture of early vision <br>
that dominated from the 1970s to the 1990s. Pylyshyn’s views notwithstanding, the fact <br>
that attention and task orientation can operate on perceptual processing <i>during</i> processing <br>
of shape and color representation, as well as before it, does not overturn central assump-<br>
tions in classical ways of understanding perceptual processing. The theoretical formula-<br>
tions of Firestone and Scholl do not, however, show that some “uninteresting” cases do not <br>
count against their stated conception of modularity.<br>
<br>
Firestone and Scholl undermine many claims that purport to demonstrate cognitive <br>
penetration. Their empirical arguments are important and illuminating. They identify <br>
mistakes (“pitfalls”) that a lot of empirical work that is taken to demonstrate cognitive <br>
penetration repeatedly falls into. There may not be a single genuinely “revolutionary” case <br>
of “cognitive penetration”. I think, however, that there are several cases that count as <br>
counter-examples to the formulations of cognitive impenetrability that they and Pylyshyn <br>
actually provide.<br>
<br>
Firestone and Scholl disparage ‘theoretical discussions’ as not moving the debate. <br>
I agree with them that many theoretical discussions, including many replies to their art-<br>
icle, are worthless. Firestone and Scholl rightly emphasize the centrality of empirically <br>
testable cases. However, there are counter-examples to their thesis, as stated, that do not <br>
fall into these pitfalls. If such cases form a class of non-revolutionary cases, that fact <br>
needs to be understood, <i>theoretically</i>. Merely dismissing the cases as non-revolutionary <br>
does not yield insight into the theoretical notion of modularity. The authors’ cavalier <br>
way of specifying what counts as perception (‘what we <i>see</i> as a whole, including visual <br>
processing and the conscious percepts’), what counts as cognition (‘what and how we <br>
think, know, desire, act, and so forth’) and what counts as being penetrated (being func-<br>
tionally dependent) makes it hard to ‘move the debate’. Their emphasis on reflection on <br>
empirical cases is completely right. Some of their criticisms of weak empirical work, <br>
especially in social psychology, are deft and decisive. However, they underestimate the <br>
importance of <i>theory</i>. Calling certain cases uninteresting, relative to issues about modu-<br>
lar ity, is sound judgment. It does not explain why such cases are less interesting than <br>
some of their advocates believe.<br>
<br>
Cases involving “cognitively driven” direction of attention of the sort cited several para-<br>
graphs back seem to be counter-examples to their formulations.1150 Wu’s example, this <br>
chapter, the section Conceptions of Penetration, may be another. It is possible, of <br>
course, that each such case involves some theoretical or methodological error. I doubt it. <br>
The idea that propositional attitudes affect visual attention seems hardly deniable. There is <br>
strong evidence that visual attention affects visual processing—including processing per-<br>
ceptual representations as of shape and color, as well as perceptual categorizations—while <br><br>
