Perceptual-Level Representation and Categorization 485</div>

with perception. A similar point applies to perceptual-level conation, perceptual-level <br>
attention initiation, and perceptual-level anticipation.<br>
<br>
I mentioned the visuo-perceptual-motor system. Talk of systems is common in science <br>
and philosophy. Of course, it is vague. I think it useful, even in unexplicated forms. In <br>
Chapter 19, the sections A Computational Construal of Modularity and <br>
Psychological Systems and Psychological Kinds, I take steps to clarify a <br>
conception of <i>system</i>. There, I make more precise what I mean by a capacity’s being part of <br>
the visual-perceptual-motor system. I do not hold that the visual-perceptual-motor sys-<br>
tem is not causally affected, even during its processing, by “cognitive-” or conceptual-level <br>
representation. I hold that the system processes only perceptual-level contents, and that <br>
computational explanations of the system’s operations have a certain self-sufficiency in <br>
their domain. Such explanations do not, and need not, advert to any causal influence on <br>
the system from supra-perceptual-level representation that may occur. Since I do not <br>
develop this view of <i>system</i> until Chapter 19, I operate until then with an open-ended, <br>
provisional notion of system.<br>
<br>
Propositional capacities are clearly supra-perceptual. They include inferential and other <br>
capacities more sophisticated and more relevant to producing explanations, reasons, and <br>
knowledge than operations in perceptual processing. Such capacities comprise the most <br>
important supra-perceptual level of representation. They are what make science and <br>
understanding possible. I discuss briefly in Chapter 19, the section What Should <br>
Count as Cognition?, whether some non-propositional capacities may be rea son-<br>
ably regarded as at a higher representational level than the level of the perceptual-motor <br>
system. Dealing with these issues in depth is beyond the scope of this book. Understanding <br>
better the breadth and complexity of the perceptual level, and of the perceptual-motor <br>
system, and its sub-systems, will be a gracious plenty to occupy us.<br>
<br>
Analogs of what I say about vision apply to aspects of hearing, touch, proprioception, <br>
and other modalities. They, too, have satellite systems of attention, memory, anticipation, <br>
imagining, learning, affect. They, too, integrate with perceptual-level conation. Discussion <br>
that follows is meant to ground better understanding of these systems’ relations to visual <br>
perception, and of what the visual system, and the visuomotor system, <i>are.<br>
<br>
</i>Recently, philosophers and scientists have written a lot about relations between vision and <br>
“cognition”. Much of this discussion has responded claims by Fodor and Pylyshyn that the <br>
visual system, or visuomotor system, is encapsulated from or impenetrable by higher, cogni-<br>
tive processes.645 I believe that much of this discussion, on both sides, has been crippled by <br>
poorly grounded thinking about perception, and about associated capacities like attention, <br>
memory, and conation. Much of it derives from dated science. Much of it is confused.<br>
<br>
Most proponents of the view that perceptual processing is encapsulated or im pene-<br>
trable from “cognition” have regarded perceptual processing as very limited. For example, <br>
Pylyshyn, following Marr and Ullman, thought that purely perceptual processing does <br>
not include categorization. Pylyshyn and other proponents of limited encapsulation take <br>
“late vision” to be a fundamentally different psychological capacity from “early vision” in <br><br>
