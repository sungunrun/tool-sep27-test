timing has the biological function of orienting the bee in space. So explanation of the bio-<br>
logical function of the bee’s non-perceptual sensory states relates them to the environment— <br>
as almost all explanations of biological function do. The pre-representational sensing <br>
mechanisms, including the timing mechanisms, are not part of a <i>representation</i> of time, or <br>
of anything else. (See Chapter 3, the section Even Non-perceptual Invariances <br>
Contribute to the Fitness of Individuals that Sense.)<br>
<br>
The same distinction applies to mechanisms in early stages of perception-formation. <br>
There is timing registration of changes in firings among <i>very</i> small groups of neurons, <br>
whose psychological counterparts are timings of zero-crossings.257 <i>Zero-crossings</i> are <br>
timed differences in registration of filtered—higher-order—properties of registrations of <br>
light intensities. They correspond to locations of sharp intensity differences in small <br>
regions of the retinal image. The timings of these zero-crossings operate on a matrix of <br>
registration of light intensities. Initially, such timings do not inform a perceptual state. <br>
Zero-crossings occur earlier in the processing sequence than registration of retinal edges. <br>
Retinal edges are sharp differences in light frequency along a certain line in the retinal <br>
image. Initial registrations of such edges are also pre-perceptual. (See Chapter 3, the <br>
 section Visual Spatial Property and Relation Constancies.)<br>
<br>
Similarly, localization in hearing often depends on temporal differences between onsets <br>
of stimuli in two ears. Timings of changes in light-registration or sound-arrival are pre-<br>
perceptual underpinnings of timings in perceptual representation. They are functionally <br>
relevant to temporal aspects of the environment.<br>
<br>
I began this section by remarking that perception is intuitively a <i>present</i> sense. There <br>
is evidence for various psychological “presents” in humans and other mammals. One <br>
“present” may extend around three seconds. This unit is marked by various phenomena. <br>
For example, reproduction of a duration of a seen or heard event, or interval between <br>
events, is fairly precise and reliably veridical up to this time period, but falls off dra mat-<br>
ic al ly at longer periods. Spontaneous alteration of gestalt switches on ambiguous figures <br>
occurs at roughly this interval. Vigilance postures in non-linguistic mammals conform <br>
to the same period, as do units of movement patterns in many mammals.258 Since this <br>
unit spans saccades, and since saccades are often taken to bound perceptual states con-<br>
nected by memory, this period may coincide with an important unit of the “present” for <br>
a combination of perception and short term trans-saccadic memory. Larger temporal <br>
periods represented in memory or anticipation may be measured by combining units of <br>
this length.<br>
<br>
Other evidence suggests a significant temporal boundary at around one second for a <br>
sequence of perceptual states that crosses saccades. In humans, counting and other atten-<br>
tional mechanisms seem extremely important in determining time accurately for periods <br><br>

<b>Cont FN</b>Bees have visual perception with large array of perceptual constancies. They do not use perception in registering <br>
speed or  direction in most flight. Most flight is governed by computations that operate entirely on changes in <br>
2-D retinal registration of arrays of light frequencies.<br>
