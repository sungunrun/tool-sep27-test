Executive Control System, Propositional Drivers 557</div>
<br><br>
The widely accepted functions of the executive control system are the following: allocat-<br>
ing additional processing resources for a task (often called ‘executive attention’); co ord in-<br>
at ing processes when plural tasks are performed at once; maintaining a task, for example <br>
by rehearsal in working memory; shifting attentional resources to aid in switching tasks; <br>
and inhibiting interferences, such as distractors, in ongoing activity.795<br>
<br>
As does conation generally, the executive control system operates in different percep-<br>
tual modalities. As does conation generally, it operates at both perceptual and prop os-<br>
ition al levels. It interacts with visual working memory and with the nexus between visual <br>
perception and relatively primitive action. It is the source of some endogenous visual per-<br>
ceptual attention. I discuss relations between executive control and working memory in <br>
Chapter 16, the section Working Memory.<br>
<br>
It is natural to expect there to be various types of individual control over action. When <br>
individuals act from representational sources, their actions are generated by conative, or <br>
actional, commands. Recall from Chapter 14 that <i>relatively primitive action</i> is action guided <br>
by perception, and not at all by conceptual or other supra-perceptual capacities and not <br>
purely by non-representational sensory states. The conative commands are at the represen-<br>
tational level of perception. It is natural that they are, because their guidance derives from <br>
perception, perceptual memory, and perceptual anticipation. In the attention case, the com-<br>
mands are again fitted to the capacities—principally the kinds of attributives—that they <br>
select for resource enhancement. (See articulation of this point Chapter 14, the section <br>
Form of Relatively Primitive Conative States and this chapter, the section <br>
Forms of Perceptual Attention.) In animals that do not obviously have prop os-<br>
ition al attitudes, mechanisms have the functions of the executive control system. Non-<br>
human primates, other mammals, birds, and even insects have mechanisms through which <br>
they change tasks, coordinate tasks, stay on task, allocate additional processing resources <br>
via attention to perceived targets of a task or a learned association, and screen out interfer-<br>
ences that would slow or prevent meeting a target. These are functions of executive control <br>
systems. Although theorizing about executive control systems in non-primates is not well <br>
developed, these mechanisms with functions of the executive control system strongly sug-<br>
gest presence of relatively primitive executive control systems, some of which operate <i>only</i> <br>
at a perceptual level or lower.796 In such cases, endogenous representational initiations of <br>
attention—attention commands—that are broadly under individual control bear no con-<br>
nection to processing that involves any supra-perceptual-level states. Such attention com-<br>
mands certainly occur in visual perceptual and visuomotor systems.<br><br>
