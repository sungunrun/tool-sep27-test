306 The Iconic Nature of Perception</div>
<br><br>
The notion of a <i>visual field map</i> is a technical notion in vision science. It applies to <br>
 layouts of neural receptors in retinal, sub-cortical, and cortical areas of visual processing. <br>
A visual field map must meet three conditions.<br>
<br>
First, a region of neural receptors should register, or ground representation of, a sub-<br>
stantial portion of the retinal image or an environmental layout. The qualification ‘sub-<br>
stantial portion’ is entered to allow for the fact that visual field maps do not register each <br>
part of whatever they register with equal surface area. Some visual field maps in V1, the <br>
earliest cortical area specialized for visual processing, are oriented primarily to foveated <br>
parts of the retinal image.<br>
<br>
Second, a visual field map must register a substantial part of what it registers in a way <br>
that preserves spatial structure. The map should be roughly continuous. Distance from the <br>
center of the map should vary roughly continuously with distance (the eccentricity) from <br>
the center of the registered entity—for example, the retinal image. Directions from the <br>
center of the map (the angle dimensions) should vary roughly continuously from direc-<br>
tions from the center of the registered entity. ‘Roughly’ allows for discontinuities. For <br>
example, it allows for discontinuities between the two hemispheres of the human brain <br>
that divide registration of the left and right sides of the retinal image. Many discontinuities <br>
bear on the border of a map. Some occur within maps.<br>
<br>
Third, the basic features of a field map must be roughly consistent across individual <br>
subjects—though maps often vary across individuals in size and precise anatomical <br>
location.309<br>
<br>
There is massive evidence for mapping from the spatial layout of registrational sensors <br>
that underlie the early stages of visual processing to areas of the retinal image. The retinal <br>
receptors, layouts in the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN), and many layouts in all the cor-<br>
tical areas (V1–V3) that support early visual processing, all constitute visual field maps.310 <br>
Since there are hundreds of V1 neurons for every ganglion cell or LGN relay neuron, there <br>
is room in V1 for many specialized maps, each mapping the retinal image, each function-<br>
ing to carry its own task. Numerous species have multiple retinotopic maps in each early <br>
processing area, such as V1.311<br><br>
