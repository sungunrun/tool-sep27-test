Fodor and Pylyshyn’s Conceptions of Modularity 657</div>
<br><br>
Sixth, input systems produce <i>shallow outputs</i>. Fodor’s does not explicate ‘shallow’. He <br>
takes representations as of color, shape, spatial relations, and bodies with characteristic <br>
shapes and sizes (like bodies with the shape and size of dogs) as examples of shallow rep-<br>
resentations. He takes representations as of protons as examples of non-shallow represen-<br>
tations. The idea seems to be that representations are shallow inasmuch as they are reliably <br>
applicable on the basis of perceptual input alone, and do not depend for their content on <br>
background theory.<br>
<br>
Seventh, input systems are associated with a <i>fixed neural architecture</i>. Fodor adds that <br>
“hard wiring” is to be expected, given the speed and mandatoriness of perceptual process-<br>
ing. I think it broadly true that salient input systems—perceptual systems, both linguistic <br>
and non-linguistic—have a natural, relatively fixed neural architecture. Of course, hard-<br>
wiring is either a metaphor or a mistake. Perceptual processing in fact undergoes changes <br>
through adaptation, priming, perceptual learning, and so on. Being relatively fixed should <br>
not be taken to disallow feedback loops and re-tunings of earlier perceptual levels in <br>
response to higher-level processing. I think that Fodor’s citation of the seventh mark is <br>
insightful, <i>taken in a sufficiently flexible way</i>.<br>
<br>
Eighth, input systems exhibit <i>characteristic breakdown patterns</i>. Fodor contrasts pat-<br>
terned failures in functioning, like agnosias and aphasias, with ‘quantitative decrements in <br>
global, horizontal capacities like memory, attention, or problem-solving’. He associates <br>
failures in modular systems with specific deficits in neural underpinnings. He explicitly <br>
places little weight on this mark. For similar patterned failures occur outside modules.<br>
<br>
Ninth, the ontogeny of input systems exhibits a <i>characteristic pace and sequencing</i>. <br>
Development of input systems follows a rough schedule across individuals. Like the eighth <br>
mark, the ninth has analogs in learning categories of linguistic meanings and in other rep-<br>
resentational competencies that are not likely to be modular.1066<br>
<br>
The seventh through ninth marks do not figure prominently in my discussion.<br>
<br>
The second through fourth marks do certainly apply, at least roughly, to some psy cho-<br>
logic al systems. Many systems are mandatory, given antecedent settings and given prox-<br>
imal inputs. They are fast. Their operations are not accessible to introspection. These <br>
marks apply to many other unconscious psychological processes that few think of as <br>
modular. Processes of associative learning are mandatory, fast, and inaccessible. <br>
Unconscious prop os ition al reasoning can be fast and inaccessible. Although not dis tinct-<br>
ive of modular input systems, these three marks are important aspects of many perceptual <br>
and perceptual-level processes.<br>
<br>
Fodor’s exposition of the sixth mark—the shallowness of output representations—is <br>
seriously unclear. It does point toward an important aspect of the products of perceptual <br>
systems. Empirical work has repeatedly supported taking ranges of perceptual representa-<br>
tions to be a relatively limited lot. For vision, representations are formed for shape, color, <br>
texture, motion, spatial and temporal properties and relations, face, body, perhaps cause <br>
and agency. Perhaps also some other functional attributives, such as predator, con-specific, <br>
food, tool, shelter—together with sub-species—are perceptual, as distinct from conative.<br>
<br>
Natural kinds, like <i>proton</i> or <i>tiger</i>, whose identity depends on structures that are not <br>
accessible to the senses, are not perceptually represented as such.<br><br>
