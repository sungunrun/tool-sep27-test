other sensory input and a relatively surveyable set of conative competencies. By contrast, <br>
propositional attitudes can apply to any subject matter, and can bear vastly more complex <br>
relations to a wider range of stimuli. They bear much more complex relations to one <br>
another.<br>
<br>
Such remarks broadly gloss why computational explanation is more manageable for <br>
perceptual-level states than for propositional attitudes. They do not explain why prop os-<br>
ition al attitudes are seemingly absent from the inputs into the computational explanations.<br>
<br>
I stated that propositional attitudes are not <i>needed</i> as elements in computational ex plan-<br>
ations. Relevant <i>explananda</i> can be computationally explained without them. But are they <br>
not <i>wanted</i>? Should not computational explanations expand to yield more explanatory <br>
insight? Even though the same visual perceptual state is computed, given that a perceptual-<br>
level attention command is issued, we know and understand <i>more</i> in a given situation if <br>
we know whether the command was itself caused by a specific propositional state—rather <br>
than by some other propositional state or by no propositional state at all. Omitting <br>
cognitive-level causal antecedents of attention commands from a computational story <br>
restricts insight that the story yields.<br>
<br>
Why <i>should</i> science <i>not</i> extend <i>computational</i> explanation of perceptual-level states so <br>
as to include propositional attitudes as inputs on which the computations operate? Since <br>
computational explanation is a gold standard, should it not be invoked when it can be?<br>
<br>
A correct response—as far as it goes—is as follows. Yes, computational explanation <br>
should be invoked when it can be. However, the network of inferential relations among <br>
the propositional attitudes is too complex to have been subjugated to computational <br>
explanation. Attempts to explain the network computationally have so far failed. There <br>
may be computational systems at the cognitive level. Some language-processing going <br>
beyond perception of language may be computational and modular. Perhaps computa-<br>
tional accounts of elementary arithmetic reasoning and deductive reasoning are in the <br>
offing. Perhaps there is promise in some domain-specific areas of default heuristic reason-<br>
ing. But computational systems of this sort do not interface with perceptual-level compu-<br>
tation in simple ways.<br>
<br>
Attempts to explain most <i>non-demonstrative</i> propositional inference, which dominates <br>
propositional inference, are much further from success. An impressive logic for non-<br>
demonstrative, non-monotonic reasoning, seems far away. We are yet further from show-<br>
ing that humans follow such logic consistently enough to ground computational <br>
<i>psy cho logic al</i> explanation.<br>
<br>
There have been brave, programmatic claims of massive modularity: the human mind is <br>
entirely composed of modules.1158 However, if we compare attempts to computationally <br><br>

L. Cosmides, and J. Tooby eds., <i>The Adaptive Mind</i> (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1992); S. Pinker, <i>How the <br>
Mind Works</i> (New York: Norton, 1997). Expressions of similar massive modularity views are equally far removed <br>
from actual computational explanations. Fodor, <i>The Mind Doesn’t Work That Way</i>, chapter 5, effectively criticizes <br>
the exceptionally naive ideological generalities that are supposed to support the cited massive modularity theses.<br>
<br>
Fodor makes several elementary mistakes in his criticism. For example, he breezily claims that cognition could <br>
not be useful if it were not veridical and that “the” function of cognition is to be true. It is obvious that perception <br>
and cognition can contribute to biological success even if they are not veridical, and that both have biological as <br>
well as representational functions. Fodor’s main critical points are insightful. There are no computational ex plan-<br>
ations, even in language processing much less non-demonstrative reasoning, that are remotely comparable to <br>
those in visual perceptual and visuo-motor psychology.</div>
