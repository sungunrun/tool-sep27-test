Representations and Representational Contents 35</div>
<br><br>
individual’s success or failure in acting in a given circumstance depending on different <br>
perspectives on the circumstance are reflected in the individual’s mastery or non-mastery <br>
of the linkage between different representational contents that mark differences in per-<br>
spective on the same circumstance.<br>
<br>
The conscious phenomenology of one’s psychological states is reflected in differences in <br>
modes of presentation of representational contents. Conscious states have different repre-<br>
sentational contents from unconscious ones. They are different types of psychological <br>
states that enter into different psychological patterns. They have different modes of presen-<br>
tation. Differences in phenomenology, even with respect to a constant <i>representatum</i>, are <br>
commonly reflected in differences in representational content.31<br>
<br>
The third constitutive aspect of representational content is constituting, or contributing <br>
to constituting, veridicality conditions. The representational content poachers are deplor-<br>
able is a veridicality condition (here, a truth condition). The concept poachers contributes <br>
to the veridicality condition poachers are deplorable. Some veridicality conditions are <br>
fulfilled. They are veridical—true or accurate. Others are not fulfilled. They are non-<br>
veridical—false or inaccurate.<br>
<br>
One way of being non-veridical is for a representational content to have a component <br>
that fails to have a <i>representatum</i>. Thus the round square is a shape is not true, because the <br>
round square lacks a <i>representatum</i>. A perceptual representational content that1 rectangu-<br>
lar surface might be inaccurate if no surface is perceived. Perhaps an odd confluence of <br>
light produces the appearance of a surface, where no surface is present. In such cases, the <br>
concept round square and the percept that1 rectangular surface have the function of repre-<br>
senting. They just do not fulfill their function. Still, they set or contribute to setting a <br>
veridicality condition.<br>
<br>
One’s understanding of what a veridicality condition is, in reflecting on thought and <br>
perception, is constrained by the other two basic aspects of representational content. The <br>
veridicality condition must be fine-grained enough to vary with psychologically different <br>
kinds of states, even if the states represent the same <i>representata</i>. Similarly, the veridicality <br>
condition must be fine-grained enough to vary with different modes of presentation of the <br>
same <i>representata</i>.<br>
<br>
On one understanding of ‘veridicality condition’, there are trillions of water molecules <br>
and there are trillions of H2O molecules have the same veridicality condition. Both are <br>
made true by the same circumstance. There is nothing wrong with this construal of ‘ver-<br>
idi cal ity condition’. However, I do not use ‘veridicality condition’ in that way. In my usage, <br>
the two representational contents constitute different veridicality conditions that are ful-<br>
filled by the same condition in the world. The veridicality conditions are psychologically, <br><br>

<b>FOOTNOTES</b><br>
<b>Cont FN</b>31 This view should not be confused with representationalism—the view that phenomenology is to be <br>
explained and individuated in terms of representation. I argue against representationalism elsewhere. <br>
See T. Burge, ‘Reflections on Two Kinds of Consciousness’ and T. Burge, ‘Philosophy of Mind: 1950–2000’, both in <br>
Burge, <i>Foundations of Mind. Philosophical Essays</i>, Volume 2. I think that when a representational state has a phe-<br>
nomenology, the phenomenology is an aspect of the individuation of the state’s mode of presentation (hence the <br>
individuation of the representational state). This view does not imply that the representational state, or any sort <br>
of representation, figures in individuating the phenomenological state or phenomenological aspect of a represen-<br>
tational state. Representational states are individuated functionally, by what and how they function in a psych-<br>
ology to represent. A phenomenology will affect such a state’s function. Phenomenal states and phe nom enal <br>
features are individuated not functionally, but by what it is like to have/feel them. They need not represent. Even <br>
when they are used in representation, they are not individuated functionally.</div>
