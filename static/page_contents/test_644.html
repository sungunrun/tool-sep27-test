644 Perceptual Learning, Anticipation, Imagining</div>

Often, however, imagery is termed ‘higher cognition’.1034 Here, cognition is contrasted <br>
with perception as being at a supra-perceptual level. As in cases of other capacities that <br>
I have discussed, the assumption of representational level-height invites scrutiny.<br>
<br>
There are certainly differences between perception and mental imagery. Mental imagery <br>
can be manipulated endogenously, without concurrent sensory input; perception cannot <br>
be. Controlled manipulation can be motivated by propositional attitudes. Endogenously <br>
controlled perceptual imagination is probably evolutionarily later than the simplest types <br>
of perception. Although experimentation with non-human animals is not very advanced, <br>
only few cases of mental rotation have, to my knowledge, been found in higher mammals.1035<br>
<br>
However, endogenous control is present in perceptual attention. Such endogenous con-<br>
trol may emerge only in more advanced perceptual systems. I have found no reason to <br>
believe that endogenously controlled perceptual attention operates at a supra-perceptual <br>
level of representation, although like imagining, it can be “driven” by background prop os-<br>
ition al attitudes, as noted in Chapter 15. Primitive and relatively primitive conation are <br>
under endogenous control.<br>
<br>
Mental rotation can help solve problems posed propositionally. A considerable amount <br>
of propositional thinking can enter into planning how to solve the problems that Shepard <br>
and Metzler posed. Obviously, perception can also help solve problems posed <br>
propositionally.<br>
<br>
Mental rotation is further removed from present stimulation than perception. So is <br>
every type of memory and anticipatory representation. Such removal does not in itself <br>
evince supra-perceptual powers. I discuss these matters further in Chapter 19.<br>
<br>
The operations commonly taken to occur in mental rotation are taken to occur in sci-<br>
entific accounts of perception.1036 Such models presuppose that like attention, memory, <br>
and anticipation, image rotation and superimposition of images on perception are not at <br>
a higher level of mental <i>operation</i> than are certain types of operation in perception- <br>
formation.<br>
<br>
For example, on some accounts of perceptual shape constancy, fast, automatic, uncon-<br>
scious operations take the same form that Shepard took rotation of images to take. On <br>
such accounts, perceptual constancy of shape under rotation is achieved by rotational <br>
operations.1037<br><br>
