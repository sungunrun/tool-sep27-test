perceptual state’s causing and guiding a representational use. To count as guidance, the <br>
caus ation of movement must be through another psychological representational state—a <br>
representational state whose practical function is to produce a response and whose repre-<br>
sentational function is to make its content veridical. The caused/guided state must borrow <br>
representational content from the perceptual state.280 That is the sense in which I take <br>
perception to require a use—a use of perceptual content by another representational state. <br>
Paradigmatically, such other states are conative: they are representational command states <br>
that cause action. A direct causal and functional relation between a perceptual state and a <br>
movement would be like a perceptual state’s causing a body to jerk in a way that is func-<br>
tional. Jerking into movement is not the same as being guided by perception and is not a <br>
use of the perception in the relevant senses of guidance and use. Even if the jerk is bio-<br>
logic al ly functional, it lacks a representational function.<br>
<br>
The representational function of a perceptual state is to be accurate. To be a representa-<br>
tional <i>use</i> of perceptual content, the state that effects the use must have a <i>representational</i> <br>
function not of <i>being</i> accurate but of helping to <i>make</i> its representational content accurate, <br>
where the content is partly or wholly derived from perception. For example, a conative <br>
state might have the content: move away from that body (or color). A non-active represen-<br>
tational state guided by perception might have the content: hold position away from that <br>
body (or color).281 These states’ representational function is to make their content ac cur-<br>
ate, or otherwise to enable their content to become accurate. Their representational con-<br>
tent derives partly from visual perception (away from, body, color). The rest (move, hold), <br>
I think, derive from proprioception. Step (1) was meant to require that perception connect <br>
to a conative or use-type (conative or emotional state, or other reactive state) <i>with repre-<br>
sentational content</i>. For perception to guide a representational use, perception must cause <br>
a representational state that uses the perceptual state’s content with a function of realizing <br>
some result that satisfies its own representational content. So perceptual states must them-<br>
selves have a functional relevance to lead to operating back on the world. Moreover, there <br>
must be a different type of representational state than a perceptual state caused by the <br>
perceptual state that uses the information produced by the perceptual state.<br>
<br>
One might propose that the causal relation between perceptual and use states is simul-<br>
taneous. Simultaneous causation is a recurrent topic of philosophical discussion. I see <br>
belief in (strictly) simultaneous causation as depending on inexact descriptions of cases, <br>
or else on a foreign notion of causation. I think that the psychological effect of a psy cho-<br>
logic al cause necessarily occurs after the cause. Psychological explanation of causal rela-<br>
tions between different states standardly takes the effects to succeed the causes. The <br><br>

<b>FOOTNOTES</b><br>
<b>Cont FN</b>280 I am inclined to think that an emotional state is a use only if it functions to produce further psychological <br>
states (paradigmatically conative states) that make something happen.<br>
281 Non-active representational states invite more reflection. Emotional states are non-active. Those that I <br>
count as candidates for being relevantly guided are disposed to produce active representational states. <br>
Representational fear is a disposition to cause (and enable perception to guide) a conative state that commands <br>
avoidance of whatever is feared. In <i>Origins of Objectivity</i>, 526, I wrote that a use state might ‘perhaps’ be ‘any <br>
functional response to the perception, active or not’. I gave <i>schreck</i> responses as examples of non-active states. I <br>
now think that this allowance of just any functional response was probably a mistake. This allowance was a lapse <br>
from the view developed in Burge, ‘Perceptual Objectivity’. Some non-active representational states (emotions <br>
like representational fear) might be guided by perception, but only if they are constitutively disposed to initiate <br>
active representational states. I leave what to say about such cases open. I do think that use requires some relation <br>
to guiding representational operations back upon the world, even if some of these operations are reactions, not <br>
actions.</div>
