represent certain types of attributes without representing other types. In visually repre-<br>
senting a body, one represents its shape, size, color, lightness, position, and orientation.377 <br>
Analogous points apply for touch. Normally, one does not hear a sound without hearing <br>
its intensity, timbre, and pitch. There is also the part–whole packaging that I have dis-<br>
cussed. Perceptual representation of edges, surfaces, bodies, and shapes induces represen-<br>
tation of their parts.<br>
<br>
Third, numerous relational attributives are induced by spatial aspects of most percep-<br>
tual representations. The fact that one body representation bears a geometric relation to <br>
another body representation in an iconic format induces not only the <i>to-the-left-of</i> attribu-<br>
tive. It also induces many other distance and directional relations, and situates each body <br>
in relation to other entities.<br>
<br>
Fourth, the role of temporal representational frameworks in perception induces further <br>
complexity in a perception, and in perceptual memories and perceptual anticipations. In <br>
representing an event, perception represents temporal relations between that event <br>
and others.<br>
<br>
In sum, in perception, a multitude of attributions and referential applications occur in <br>
the representational content any given perception. I have identified four sources of com-<br>
plexity: (a) multiple levels of abstraction under most generic of perceptual attributives <br>
(attributives for shape, color, lightness, edge, surface, and body, for example); (b) pack-<br>
aging different types of attributives; (c) the systematic framework aspects of spatial repre-<br>
sentation; and (d) the systematic framework aspects of temporal representation. There are <br>
no doubt further sources.<br>
<br>
Complexity in perceptual representation is not a consequence of iconicity <i>per se</i>. <br>
Certain diagrams are iconic and lack these types of complexity. A digitally marked chart <br>
that represents population by a bar’s height would represent only a specific number of <br>
people. Such iconicity abstracts to a single property. Representation of color shades by <br>
same-colored color-shaded chits also exemplifies iconic representation that does not <br>
 represent packages of properties.<br>
<br>
What makes iconic packaging of properties—and other iconic representation—com-<br>
mon in natural systems of perceptual representation is that the evolution of such systems <br>
molded them to the natural world. Surfaces, bodies, shapes, sizes, colors, textures come as <br>
packages in the natural world. Sensory systems evolved to represent at least as much about <br>
the world as is useful for the organism, given the complexity and sensitivity of the organ-<br>
ism’s equipment. Psychological systems that do not represent attributes in packages are <br>
either extremely primitive, or involve conventional abstraction that is useful for commu-<br>
nication or analytical control.<br>
<br>
As discussed in Chapter 10, it used to be thought by mainstream psychologists that <br>
spatial relations between perceived entities are established only through shifts of attention, <br>
for example in visual search. The idea depended on the mistaken belief that pure percep-<br>
tion—as distinguished from a mix of perception and higher cognitive representation—is <br><br>

<b>Cont FN</b>377 Dretske, <i>Knowledge and the Flow of Information</i>, 136–141, discusses similar issues under the, I think mis-<br>

framework in which he works also differs from my specifically representational framework. However, I find his <br>
