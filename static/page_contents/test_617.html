with the top toward the right) in a certain position within a certain pattern of distractors. <br>
The same pattern of distractors and a standardly positioned target-object were shown only <br>
intermittently. After 9–12 repetitions of the pattern over 15–20 minutes with random <br>
intervening exposures, the association between target-object and pattern of distractors <br>
was learned. Neural evidence indicates that the effect of the acquired association occurs <br>
50–100 ms after stimulus onset in perceptual processing.<br>
<br>
The association is thought to cause attention to be directed to a position of the target-<br>
object, thus speeding visual search. It is known that attention driven partly by retention of <br>
previous information is faster than attention driven purely by exogenous factors.963<br>
<br>
The loci and nature of learned associations are unclear. The associations could be fed <br>
back to earliest visual processing from higher perceptual areas, after 150 ms post-stimulus-<br>
onset. Or it could be stored in earliest areas specialized for visual processing, V1 or V2. In <br>
the former case, the associations would be stored in long-term visual memory. In the lat-<br>
ter, the association might be pre-representational. Then the retention would not be of per-<br>
ceptual attributives. It would not then count as long-term memory, given my terminology. <br>
It would count as long-term retention of perceptually relevant information registration. <br>
Such retention affects perceptual representation formed from information about 2-D pat-<br>
terns in the retinal image, speeding it. (The experiment’s displays are of surface shapes in a <br>
plane; no depth information is needed for the learning.). In either case, the computational <br>
matchings—whether between retained and occurrent pre-perceptual registrations or <br>
between retained and occurrent perceptual attributives—depend on low-level association <br>
and matching operations association. The same point applies to relations between long-<br>
term scene-gist memory and perceptual categorization. The operations are association <br>
and matching. They are certainly not more advanced than perceptual processing.<br>
<br>
Central functions of ability-general long-term perceptual memory are: serving as a <br>
basis for matching current perceptual attributives in refining perceptual attribution, pro-<br>
viding a sense of recognition in perceptual categorization, speeding visual search, and <br>
guiding perceptual attention.<br>
<br>
Ability-general long-term memory interacts substantially with the <i>de re</i> forms of long-<br>
term memory, to be discussed next. Recognition of a past-perceived episode can be <br>
primed and guided by ability-general long-term memory. One remembers specifically <br>
shaped objects better, and recognizes such objects faster, if representation of the shape is <br>
stored in memory. Memory of more specific shapes and colors contributes to memory of <br>
objects and events as they were first experienced. Ability-general memory retains not only <br>
exemplars but statistically significant patterns of co-occurrence. Retained co-occurrence of <br>
attributives facilitates memory of perceptual reference to <i>particulars</i>. Particulars are better <br>
recalled in the context of a specific natural scene than if they are removed from the natural <br>
scene in which they were originally perceived.<br>

A door is better remembered if it is shown in a room never seen before, than if a con-<br>
text surrounding the door (light fixtures, surrounding walls, and so on) is edited out of a <br>
display.964 The importance of context emerged when vision and memory were tested in <br><br>
