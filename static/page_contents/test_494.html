494 Perceptual-Level Representation and Categorization</div>
<br><br>
Although color attributions and color constancies are formed very quickly, they play <br>
little role in the initial categorizations, unless a color is partly diagnostic of a category, as <br>
yellow is for a banana-body.657 Black and white shapes in low light generate cat egor iza-<br>
tions just as fast and almost as accurately as corresponding colored shapes in brighter <br>
light do.<br>
<br>
Highest speeds of perceptual categorization occur when objects are in familiar orienta-<br>
tion in uncluttered and well segmented scenes, at close range. Multiple objects can be cat-<br>
egor ized in the first categorizations without shifts of attention. It is thought that such <br>
processing depends on settings present in-advance—either innate or learned. Such pro-<br>
cessing is dominantly feedforward and makes no essential use of inputs from attention or <br>
memory.658<br>
<br>
A large wave of feedback processing takes hold at about 150 ms. There is some familiar-<br>
ity with individual faces, some recognition-level categorization by 140 ms. More specific, <br>
less generic shapes are represented, and categorizations thereby become richer and more <br>
specific. Most categorized <i>object recognition</i>, based on relatively specific shape-based cat-<br>
egor iza tions, occurs after 200 ms but before 300 ms.659<br>
<br>
Categorization from 150 ms to a saccade, at 300–350 ms, remains perceptual. Of course, <br>
perceptual categorizations can be preserved in trans-saccadic memory. In being percep-<br>
tual, perceptual categorizations are exercises of perceptual capacities.<br>
<br>
As noted, perceptual processing becomes more complicated and more multi-directional <br>
after 150 ms. Perceptual processing takes feedback from endogenous attention and from <br>
memory, including long-term memory, in producing refinements of initial categorizations <br>
just sketched. The products of these inputs remain perceptual categorizations—they are <br>
perceptual attributives, clearly perceptual capacities produced by standard perceptual <br>
processing.<br>
<br>
These basic facts are sometimes obscured, not merely by defective conceptions of con-<br>
cepts and perceptual attributives, but by what I believe to be misconceptions of what a <br>
perceptual system is. One of the main points of the remainder of the book is to clear some <br>
of these misconceptions and to understand the notion of a perceptual (or perceptual-<br>
motor) system in a way that accords with the explanatory practice of the science. This <br>
exercise is meant also to contribute to better understanding of the distinction between <br>
perception and cognition, or perception and conception.<br>
<br>
It is sometimes thought that “top-down” feedback itself shows that the perceptual sys-<br>
tem is a myth. On this view, a mix of more perceptual or more cognitive representations <br>
occurs along a spectrum, with no point to finding a system or drawing a distinction. I do <br><br>
