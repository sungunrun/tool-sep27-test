226 Attributives, Referential Applications in Constancies</div>

(attributives) for the edge’s intrinsic, constant, coordinate-system-independent length and <br>
shape via specification of the positions of the edge and its parts, relative to the perceiver, <br>
vary in the two cases. The plotted specifications are the ways relevant attributes are indi-<br>
cated and attributed. So variation in plottings (here, plotting-numbers) for the constant <br>
attributes just <i>is</i> variation in the attributives that indicate and attribute the constant <br>
attributes.<br>
<br>
Perceptual representations plot (map) positions of perceived particulars in an egocen-<br>
tric spatial coordinate system of visibly discriminable parts of an edge. Our illustration <br>
specified only edge mid-point and endpoints. To imagine the illustration fully, one must <br>
imagine position-specifications, relative to anchor position, for every discernible part of <br>
the edge. The full edge, insofar as it is visibly discernible and insofar as the distances of its <br>
parts can be represented, is plotted in the coordinate system, with numbers for direction <br>
and distance applied for each discernible part of the edge. Obviously, the point applies to <br>
more complex figures—surfaces, three-dimensional shapes, spatial relations, geometrical <br>
textural elements, and so on. Analogs of the point apply for plottings of ordinal depth that <br>
are indeterminate about exact positions.<br>
<br>
Perceptual representation of whole edges is computed from pre-perceptual registrations <br>
of short segments in the retinal image. Initial <i>perceptual</i> representations of edges are as of <br>
whole edges, oriented in 3-D space. (See Chapter 3, the sections Retinal Image <br>
Contour Registration and Surface Contour Perception and Visual <br>
Spatial Property and Relation Constancies.) In cases in which the system <br>
can specify a definite length for an edge, the system plots the edge and marks its endpoints. <br>
It does not build its attribution out of prior<i> representations</i> of tiny edge-parts. The edge-<br>
parts are perceived as parts in the way in which, occlusions aside, a drawing draws both a <br>
line and all its (dis cern ible) parts. (See Chapter 9, the section Part–Whole <br>
Representation in Pictures and Visual Perception.)<br>
<br>
The numerical specifications are, of course, fictions. The example is intended to make <br>
concrete, and, I hope, easy to imagine, what it is to plot a spatial attribute in an egocentric <br>
coordinate system. In fact, specification of spatial attributes in a coordinate system is unit-<br>
and number-free. Distances and directions are specified as magnitudes. There is probably <br>
no unit of measure, such as a hand-width, and certainly no numbers that measure units. <br>
In thought, we use conventional units of measure, such as meters. Convention does not <br>
figure in operations of perceptual systems. Still, specific magnitudes are attributed, at the <br>
ground level via the egocentric coordinate system.219<br>
<br>
When one sees an edge as an edge, one sees it as having a specific length, shape, and <br>
orientation, and as having visually discriminable parts. As noted, a length can be specified in <br>
different ways. Suppose that you ask how long a tree branch that you cannot see is, and <br>
someone answers by holding up a stick, saying ‘as long as this stick’. No one has measured <br>
the stick. The answer can be a correct answer. The form of the answer involves the stick <i>as <br>
shown</i>. As shown, the stick is in one of many possible orientations and distances, many of <br>
which would be approximately equally good in informing you of the length of the stick <br><br>
