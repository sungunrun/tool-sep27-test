Primitive Attribution of Agency 471</div>

more sophisticated as children learn more about various agents’ potentials and more about <br>
environmental constraints.623<br>
<br>
The suite of anticipations that accompany primitive representation of agency in infants <br>
figures prominently in differentiating representation of agency from representation of <br>
shapes and motions of bodies. They do so even for the representational content of present-<br>
oriented representation. The best explanation of infants’ grouping shapes and motions in <br>
the ways that they do, and associating them with functional responses (fear, avoidance, or <br>
approach) and functional anticipations (anticipations of targets, anticipations of responses <br>
by target objects, and anticipations of efficiency in means of reaching a target) is that <br>
infants represent agents as having targets and as moving to reach the targets. The psy cho-<br>
logic al states were molded to be the states that they are through their sensory interactions <br>
with agents. As in the cases of representation of body and representation of mechanical <br>
causation, the content of a representational state depends partly on what anticipatory dis-<br>
criminations are associated with it. If the representational states are perceptual, their con-<br>
tents depend partly on associated perceptual anticipations.<br>
<br>
As with representation of mechanical causation, I think it right to take infants to at tri-<br>
bute not only specific kinds of agency—chasing, fleeing, eating, and so on—but agency itself.<br>
<br>
More is known about non-human animals’ capacities to attribute agency than is known <br>
about their capacities to attribute causation. Newborn chicks distinguish agents from non-<br>
agents by both aspects of faces and endogeneous motion. They evince social attraction to <br>
agents.624 So they exhibit some of the anticipational structure that distinguishes self-<br>
moving objects as agents.<br>
<br>
Baby chimpanzees and macaque monkeys distinguish biological motion from <br>
Newtonian motion, and faces from other objects. They anticipate targets for endogenously <br>
caused motion. They act out models’ intended action, even when that behavior has not <br>
been displayed. Adult chimpanzees anticipate complex movements by both prey and <br>
conspecifics.625<br><br>

showed that 14-month-old infants imitated an adult’s pressing her head to a box top to illuminate the box if the <br>
adult’s hands were engaged, but opened the box with their hands if the adult pressed her head to the box when <br>
the adult’s hands were not engaged. Since this famous experiment is associated with complex issues regarding <br>
imitation or emulation, and since it applies to children who have already begun to learn language, it is harder to <br>
assess what psychological capacities are in play here than with 6-month-olds. Some anticipation of efficient <br>
means to ends is clearly in play at the younger age. For a striking, non-standard explanation of the famous hand-<br>
occupied case, see M. Beisert, N. Zmyj, R. Liepelt, F. Jung, W. Prinz, and M. Daum, ‘Rethinking “Rational <br>
Imitation” in 14-Month-Old Infants: A Perceptual Distraction Approach’, <i>PLoS ONE</i> 7 (2012), https://doi.<br>
org/10.1371/journal.pone.0032563. This article tries to explain the children’s behavior in ways that would invoke <br>
neither attributions of rationality nor attributions of efficiency. Apart from imitation, however, there is substan-<br>
tial evidence that children between 4 and 16 months anticipate efficiency. See note 615; also R. Scott and <br>
