substantial feedback after that initial burst. It includes not only early categorization, but <br>
also enrichment of initial categorizations and gist-like sketches. It includes retention of <br>
perceptual content across saccades. It includes input from endogenous attention and inter-<br>
action with perceptual memory—short-term and long-term. It includes processes and <br>
upshots of perceptual learning. It includes perceptual anticipation. It includes perceptual <br>
imagining. In this chapter, I work toward an understanding of what unifies the visual, <br>
visuo-motor, and perceptual-motor systems, so conceived.<br>
<br>
The points about vision have obvious carry-over to understanding interactions among <br>
perceptual systems in non-visual modalities. The visual system is a natural kind within a <br>
natural-kind complex that includes other perceptual systems—the auditory system, the <br>
tactile system, the proprioceptive system—with their own interactions with conation, <br>
attention, memory, and anticipation.<br>
<br>
The issue of cognitive penetration is, of course, immensely complex. I do not hope to do <br>
it justice here, toward the end of an already long book.<br>
<br>
In the next section, I sketch how discussion of these matters has proceeded over the last <br>
six decades. Using that section as background, I criticize more recent stages of the discus-<br>
sion. Then I explain why typical uses of the term ‘cognition’ have not served to clarify <br>
psychological kinds. The term ‘cognition’ is used in many ways, some of which are mutu-<br>
ally incompatible. There is no established or widespread use that is clear. I explain these <br>
points in the section Uses and Misuses of the Term ‘Cognition’. Finally, I try to <br>
make progress in understanding the scope and limits of perception and associated <br>
perceptual-level psychological kinds and psychological systems.<br>
<br>
I continue to use the term ‘cognition’ as a placeholder. I discuss options for clearer use, <br>
in the section What Should Count as Cognition?, below. Here I review ideas <br>
that guide use of this placeholder.<br>
<br>
I understand cognition to be a generic set of capacities that is disjoint from perception <br>
and perceptual-level capacities. It probably has attributives—characterizing capacities—<br>
that are not present in perception or perceptual-level capacities. Its operations are more <br>
advanced than those in perceptual-level capacities. In deference to etymology, I take cog-<br>
nition to be loosely knowledge-like. I take it to involve a higher or more sophisticated level <br>
of representation than perceptual-level capacities. Paradigms of cognition are prop os-<br>
ition al states, concepts (ability-general representations or representational contents that <br>
function, constitutively, to contribute to propositional states), and propositional inference. <br>
I do not assume that cognition is limited to these paradigms—that conceptual capacities <br>
and cognition are identical. I leave these matters open. I consider the issue in What <br>
Should Count as Cognition?.<br><br>

on Cognitive Influence on Perception<br><br>

</b>Since the 1950s, much philosophical discussion of perception, and some discussion in <br>
psychology, has been cast in terms of the degree to which perception depends on, makes <br>
use of, or is influenced by cognition, concepts, or background theory.<br>
<br>
In philosophy, claims that perception <i>requires</i> concepts, even language, were common <br>
even in the last half of the twentieth century. Many maintained that concepts, or language, </div>
