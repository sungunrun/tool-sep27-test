112 Some BaSicS aBout PercePtion and PercePtual SyStemS</div>

For present purposes, think of a word as a type of shape or sound that is in fact part <br>
of some language or idiolect, but without any assumption about what it means or repre-<br>
sents. So construed, the word is a word only because it is used in certain ways by lan-<br>
guage users. Its meaning in an idiolect or community depends on such use. It could <br>
have a different meaning if individuals used it differently. Its identity as a word, given <br>
that it is meaningfully used, is completely independent of whatever it happens to mean. <br>
Its being a word depends on its actually having <i>some</i> linguistic use. In itself, though, it is <br>
just a shape or sound. The word could have had no meaning at all. Then it would not <br>
have been a word.<br>
<br>
There is no encouragement from the science of perceptual psychology to think that <br>
perceptual transformations are computations that operate only on language-like or syn-<br>
tactic items <i>that are in fact representational, but that could have had a different representa-<br>
tional content or no representational content at all</i>. No level of the science postulates <br>
symbols whose identities are determinable independently of what and how they represent. <br>
No psychological laws of formation are specified by reference to any such items.<br>
<br>
Computations in perceptual processing operate on representations or representational <br>
contents.118 Representational contents are kinds of psychological states. Representations <br>
are instances of those kinds. Both are individuated in terms of their representational <br>
 properties. There is no support in the actual theories of the science for the view that all <br>
computations that operate on perceptual states operate on symbols, types of neural states, <br>
or anything else understood to be what it is independently of its representational proper-<br>
ties. In fact, the whole point of formulating computational laws is to understand how <br>
 perceptual representation of the environment, representation that is accurate or in accur-<br>
ate, is formed. There is no need to postulate a further layer of computation that operates <br>
on symbols that are the symbols that they are <i>independently of their identity as specific <br>
representations or representational contents</i>.<br>
<br>
The idea that perceptual psychology must be committed to such a view derives from an <br>
ideology with no sound scientific basis. I think it a serious mistake to think that philo-<br>
sophical considerations force acceptance of the view, despite the science’s failure to hold it. <br>
I discuss these points step by step.<br>
<br>
Two claims that are <i>not</i> committed to the position that I reject are <i>part</i> of the language-<br>
of-thought hypothesis as applied to perception. I accept both:<br><br>
(1) Perceptual states are representational; the representations associated with full  perceptual <br>
<br>
states are structured.<br><br>
I add that the representational contents of perceptual states are also structured. Perceptual <br>
representations are instances in particular minds at particular times of representational <br>
contents.<br><br>

and Burge, ‘Origins of Perception’. Much of the following criticism of applying Fodor’s language-of-thought <br>
hypothesis to visual perception is laid out in the latter work. The view that some computations, including those in <br>
perceptual psychology, operate on representational content is developed and elaborated in much greater detail in <br>
