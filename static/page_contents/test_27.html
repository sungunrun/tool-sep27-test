Representation and Information Registration 27</div>

As noted, there are those who nevertheless identify the notion with that of mental rep-<br>
resentation. There are those who purport to replace the latter notion for all good scientific <br>
purposes. Usually this view is abetted by conceptual confusion—the confusion of realiza-<br>
tion of a biological function, which is a practical matter, with being veridical, which is not <br>
a practical matter. Sometimes the view is motivated by a naive reductionism—taking a <br>
simple idea to explain everything psychological. Sometimes the view is motivated by the <br>
now-outdated belief that there is something unscientific about psychological or mentalis-<br>
tic notions.<br>
<br>
Whatever the motive, the view is implausible. More importantly, it is out of touch with <br>
very powerful psychological science. Often presenting itself as hard-headed and scientific, <br>
it is in fact at odds with well-established explanations in science. Basic causal explanation <br>
in perceptual psychology, for example, appeals to states that are unquestionably psy cho-<br>
logic al, in that they are representational: they are veridical or non-veridical.<br>
<br>
Nearly all psychological science is at odds with taking information registration to <br>
replace distinctively psychological notions in all scientific explanations. Theories of per-<br>
ception, theories of memory, theories of concept formation and of conceptual categoriza-<br>
tion, theories of reasoning, theories of desire and decision, semantical theories in <br>
psycho-linguistics, all use representational notions in their explanations. No good reason <br>
has ever been given for ignoring or replacing the explanations and taxonomies of these <br>
sciences.<br>
<br>
One psychological science stands out—perceptual psychology. It stands out by virtue of <br>
the rigor and power of its explanations, its capability of making fine-grained predictions, <br>
its core stability, and its progressive accumulation of knowledge and theoretical refine-<br>
ment. It is a science in its early maturity. Its explanations are more impressive in math em-<br>
at ic al sophistication and predictive power than explanations in many parts of biology, <br>
including parts of neuro-science. It is not to be blown off as a baby science, quite likely to <br>
change course in the future.<br>
<br>
What is striking about this science is that it explicitly utilizes representational notions in <br>
its core causal explanations. Representational states figure both as causes and as effects in <br>
causal, computational explanations that invoke general transformation laws among psy-<br>
chological states. The states are <i>individuated</i> in terms of their specifications of specific <br>
environmental properties, relations, or kinds. That is, there is no more basic way of char-<br>
acterizing the states than characterizing them in terms of these specifications. The specifi-<br>
cations allow the question whether they are veridical, whether the environment is as <br>
specified. That is to say, they have and set veridicality conditions. Of course, causal ex plan-<br>
ations do <i>not</i> explain events by appealing to veridicality. They explain by appeal to states <br>
that are veridical or not. They explain the causal process of forming perceptual states, and <br>
the role such states play in causing formation of further perceptual states. And the ex plan-<br>
ations, and the law-like principles that the explanations appeal to, identify the perceptual <br>
states by the veridicality conditions that they set. For example, the explanations center on <br>
how retinal stimuli cause formation of a perceptual state as of a brown surface and on the <br>
role of such a perceptual state in causing another perceptual state as of a brown sphere. <br>
The perceptual states set veridicality conditions that can, in given instances, be accurate or <br>
inaccurate.<br>
<br>
This point does not need citations. Any mainstream paper in psychophysics that <br>
explains perceptual processing to, or beyond, the emergence of perceptual constancies will </div>
