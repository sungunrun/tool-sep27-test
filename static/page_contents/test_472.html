472 Primitive Attribution of Causation, Agency</div>
<br><br>
They anticipate efficient movement to targets, <i>modulo</i> constraints.626 Chimpanzees can <br>
determine whether some target object is in a line of sensing for a superior chimpanzee, and <br>
form anticipations of how the superior will act with or without the sensory information.627<br>
<br>
Much of the structure of infant primitive agency-representation occurs in other higher <br>
mammals and in birds. Details of anticipations and sensitivities vary with species, or <br>
groups of individuals in a species.<br>
<br>
As mentioned earlier, early attributions of agency and animacy are closely connected. I <br>
think that agency representation is developmentally earlier than animacy representation. <br>
Possibly, at some developmental stage, a representation indicates equally animals and <br>
agents without distinguishing them. They do tend to occur together. I think it more likely <br>
that agency attribution comes first. It may be present from the start. In any case, once <br>
agential <i>structure</i> emerges in representation—act/target, act/target-object structure, for <br>
example—agency is attributed.<br>
<br>
Much of the literature on developmental psychology runs together the two types of <br>
attributives. Relevant cues for primitive attributions of animacy are said to be facial body-<br>
parts, eye body-parts, and certain types of texture and contour. There is some evidence <br>
that infants treat some (but not all) non-human species (with faces and eyes) differently <br>
from other objects, at least with some exposure. It is not clear that these cues are not cues <br>
at first only to attributions of agency. The same can be said about various motion cues that <br>
are plausibly triggers of agency attribution.<br>
<br>
By 4 to 6 years of age, children are fairly good at distinguishing living from non-living <br>
objects in their reports. They tend to associate <i>life</i>  with animacy (largely ignoring or exclud-<br>
ing plants). In this same rough period and up to 10 years of age, children tend to base their <br>
reports that something is alive on observations of target-directed agency.628 Attributions of <br>
animacy are also associated, at around 4 years of age, with biological processes—growth, heal-<br>
ing, reproduction, inheritance, illness, contagion.629 Relatively clear attribution of an animate-<br>
inanimate distinction is present by 2–3 years of age. Again, I think that agency is probably a <br>
fundamental cue for animacy attribution, suggesting that agency attribution comes first.630<br><br>
